 The second dose gives you the most protection from becoming seriously ill and/or hospitalized due to COVID-19. For example, with Pfizer, studies show 52% effectiveness after the first dose and 95% after the second dose. For Moderna, the company reported 80% effectiveness after the first dose and 94.1% after the second. If you don’t receive both doses, then you’re not going to be as protected from becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.",lt3gj0,2021-02-27 17:13:21
I asked the same question yesterday. I am two weeks out from my first dose and would like to know when I start gaining immunity. I’ve heard as early as 14 days and heard many others saying day 21. Who knows.,lt3gj0,2021-02-26 20:29:07
"> In a study of about 4,000 health-care personnel, police, firefighters and other essential workers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the vaccines reduced the risk of infection by 80 percent after one shot. Protection increased to 90 percent following the second dose. The findings are consistent with clinical trial results and studies showing strong effectiveness in Israel and the United Kingdom, and in initial studies of health-care workers at the University of Texas and in Southern California.

"Check with your doctor. Your immune response depends on your age & genetic make up, as well as prior covid infection which affect time to form protective neutralising antibodies, ie not getting the current version of covid vs being sick but not needing hospital admission. Moderna has extremely high efficacy, but doses are limited, wish I could have it...

Note full immunity to the CURRENT circulating virus is 4-6 weeks after the 2nd dose, assuming the pessimistic scenario. Its hard work & time consuming producing trillions of neutralising antibodies,  not just detectable amounts, which happens much sooner.

My elementary school administration must think the first dose harbors some immunity as they forced us to continue teaching and being around adorable germ goblins before the second dose (which I finally just got). I have no official way to measure it but these kids spread sickness like crazy and I do think I would have gotten sick if not for the first dose.,lt3gj0,2021-03-07 20:35:27
"To be honest. I think everyone’s body is different on how it reacts. I had Covid a month and half a go and I got my vaccine yesterday, already in these hours since, I have been bed ridden. Was y worse than my Covid case. But I am thankful to get the vaccine. 

As for my mom who also got it at the same, her arm is just very sore. Someone in Reddit told me how if you had Covid, the side effects will be worse.",lt3gj0,2021-03-22 03:28:58
"It probably depends on the age of the person, I read that after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a 20-29 year old had 95% immunity after 21 days (100% immunity after the second dose) but an 80 year old only had around 30% immunity after 21 days. I haven't read a study on the Moderna vaccine. The Pfizer study was done in the UK/England.",lt3gj0,2021-03-03 21:57:09
"I've done extensive research on this mainly because I want some piece of mind at work and  to shed the better KN95 mask that has protected me for a more comfortable one. I'm also ready to go to a bar with my friends and get back to normal at the soonest possible risk/ reward point.

I got my shot on March 1.  From everything I have consumed the vaccine is about 75% effective after 2 weeks and continues to build to around 83% effective by the time you take the 2nd shot in the real world Mayo Clinc study in the US. In the clinical trials it was 92% from week 2 to 4, but one would assume you probably build your way up from day 14 to 28 to that 92%.

In Israel with the pfizer vaccine was apparently 75% effective too after 2 weeks and a pretty good analog and all appear to be higher than that at preventing severe disease (85%) which is the main point.

I plan on going to the bar on March 19th so I will have nearly 3 weeks in of vaccine building and I think the efficacy seems to me like it's worth the risk reward at that point. I need it personally as disciplined as I have been social distancing mainly just to reintroduce myself in social settings and outside my bubble. Waiting another month for 7 to 10% isn't worth it IMO

I'll still play it safe (mask etc) until everyone else has a chance to get a vaccine but I feel protected enough and am ready to have a party night and if others are at a bar anyway can't worry about them so much, they assume the risk too and have probably been there the whole time.

Hopefully the alcohol doesn't ruin the effectiveness because I'll already be screwed when I pounded beers celebrating getting the vaccine that first week and feeling like this was over. After I read that could potentially comprises your immunity I went dry last week and will this week as well too to give my body a better shot at building immunity. It's been a long year.",lt3gj0,2021-03-15 16:40:37
"This isn’t clinical but will report that my aunt had her first Moderna shot 2 weeks ago. Has almost no reaction to vaccine - just a sore arm.

COVID-19 Vaccine Development
 
 • 
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: The Company shared an update on the Phase 3 COVE study of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) at its annual Vaccines Day on April 14, 2021. An updated review of adjudicated cases identified over 900 cases of COVID-19 in the COVE study as of April 9th, including over 100 cases of severe COVID-19, as defined in the protocol, with a median follow-up of approximately 6 months post dose 2. Vaccine efficacy starting two weeks following the second dose and based on the updated adjudicated cases remains consistent with prior updates, including greater than 90% efficacy against all cases of COVID-19, and greater than 95% efficacy against severe cases of COVID-19. The COVE study is ongoing and reported results remain preliminary. Throughout the year, Moderna will be sharing updated data from the Phase 3 COVE study including efficacy against asymptomatic infection, genotyping data, additional antibody persistence data and information regarding potential correlates of protection. Moderna has also received emergency (or other conditional, interim or provisional) authorization for use of its COVID-19 vaccine from health agencies in Canada, Israel, the European

"What I sent VAERS today and a lawyer in NYC trying to investigate all the vaccine side effects and injuries that the govt is hiding!!!!! 

To whom it may concern, 
 
I am writing the email on behalf of my newly deceased father. I have information to believe that the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine given to my late father on Wednesday, March 24th was his demise. My father suddenly passed away at 10:58pm (3-29-2021) after his 69th birthday the week before. I have the lot number, the vaccine card and everything. He received the 2nd dose of the mRNA vaccine 5 days prior. My dad did have type 2 diabetes but was not on his deathbed. He was driving, and living an independent life. He was just at his friend's house the prior day (Sunday) discussing politics and life. 
 
Here is the timeline of what happened:
 
3-29-2021 - 5:30pm - I receive a phone call from my Aunt that EMS just took my dad to Grand Blanc hospital because he was feeling unwell. He had vomited prior and felt sick. EMS shows up and she observes them checking him out. His blood sugar was 136 or 139, nothing bad. EMS checked him out and he disclosed he had the vaccine 5 days prior. EMS said oh it's probably just the side effects. The one worker said he had bad side effects and felt bad for a couple days. They asked him if he was sure he wanted to go in. He said yes.
 
- After I got off the phone with my aunt I called up to the hospital and inquired about my dad. I was transferred to a doctor in his care. She told me that they just intubated him and he was on a ventilator. I asked why?? She told me that he was very sick. She would not answer many of my questions. I am my dad's power of attorney and I have the paperwork in case I needed it and headed up there. 
 
6:50 exactly: I walk into his ER room and see him. He is on a vent and totally knocked out. He has antibiotics going into him, sleeping meds, and meds to rise his blood pressure. He looks awful. Doctor comes and sees me after a good while after I asked for her. She tells me that he was unresponsive hence the vent. I asked about his O2 and she said that was fine just unresponsive. It didn't make sense. She said labs were being done now. They had him on Dextrose, Propofol, Dexmedtominine that I took pics of. I asked ASAP when I arrived at 6:50 to transfer him to Beaumont Royal Oak. They started the process. 
 
Around 8:10 the doctor presents me with his lab results. Not good. Kidneys and liver are VERY messed up showing multi-organ failure. Triponin high too. These were his results that I took down on my notes:
Creatine 9.93
Gfr (kidney) 5
Hemoglobin 7
Liver lft 500
Triponin 14
Covid test negative 
 White count in range 

At this point I knew my dad was in very bad shape. The doctor told me nothing about his heart just that her thinking it was an infection or possible covid was wrong. His covid test was negative and white count was in range. I mentioned the vaccine again. She said nothing. At this point I was just waiting to get him the hell out of there. Nothing made sense of why my dad was having multi organ issues. What was the antagonist? The only thing that changed was him getting that vaccine 5 days prior. 
 
9:30: EMS shows up to prepare my dad. It takes a bit of time. 
 
9:41 exactly - my dads heart started to drop. It flatlined in front of me. Staff came running to do CPR to chest. They brought in nor epi pens and Lucas manual CPR thing to CPR heart. 

A little after 10: they get heart started. It runs for about 4 mins. Flatlines again 

10:05 CPR until 10:28. Heart is done doctor said. Too damaged. Walls not closing. 

10:28pm : Time of death 

After my dad passed away they left him in room with me and my mom (my dad’s ex wife). A doctor came in around 10 mins later to tell us they were not doing an autopsy. Shocked, I didn’t know what to say. I was still trying to process my dad’s SUDDEN and traumatic death to an onlooker. I just nodded and said okay. 

March 31st: funeral home tells us hospital won’t sign death certificate. They had to call medical examiner. 

April 1st: funeral home says they have a doctor to sign death certificate and they say it’s sepsis. 

April 16th. We receive my dad’s death certificate. It lists cause of death 

Renal failure 
Type 2 Diabetes 
Hypotension 
And the death NATURAL 
 
 * Note there is No sepsis on it. 
 

My dad was not the healthiest man. He had type 2 diabetes and some other issues from it: kidney issues. He was NOT on dialysis yet or ready for that yet. He was in fine health the week before the 2nd vaccine. We saw him. He was fine. His friends saw him. No red flags. 


My dad was addressing his type 2 diabetes by keeping all his quarterly checkups. His last one was mid January. I will get those records along along with the ER records from when he died.",lt3gj0,2021-04-17 03:17:49
My 65 yr old mom is worried because she had to delay her 2nd dose. About a week after her first dose she caught bronchitis that turned into walking pneumonia. Her doctor put her on antibiotics and steroids and she was advised by her doctor and the health department not to get the 2nd dose while on steroids. She about 8 wks from her first dose and the health dept is recommending she take the J&J shot for her second dose. She’s conflicted as to whether she should do that or stay with Moderna for her 2nd dose.,lt3gj0,2021-03-28 05:33:33

im on week 1 of the second shot. I wonder how it is,lt3gj0,2021-05-21 00:56:20
"Here in UK I had already had AZ vaccine dose1 when the news broke about clotting. I (a 50yo male) considered the risk of continuing with 2nd dose low. 

I asked the doctor administering the vaccine what he thought of the risks. He said the risk of serious illness from Covid-19 greatly outweighs the risk of blood clot from the AZ vaccination in 55+ age category. 

When I asked about Moderna for my wife(43yo), he continued: it would be better to wait for Moderna as the serious risk of hospitalisation posed by Covid-19 is statistically less for her age group. So why risk getting blood clot?

So for those in the middle age range of 45-55 it is quite a gamble. The statistics (*1) would appear to show there is greater risk of blood clot in women than men. But the risk is low (93 events in 22.3million across all groups). 
Moderna trials (*2) report those over 65 have little side effect. >1-10 of those under 65 experience swelling at site of vaccine, headaches, vomiting +other symptoms.

"Actually, I’ll assume this was cherry picked in a Google search based on a New England Journal of Medicine study - which is lacking some significant data.

In my opinion, this “study” was done to promote the pushing of “single dose for all” - as the UK decided to do (but I believe backtracked on already) with the belief that “a single dose to more people is better than waiting to do both doses for fewer people” - meaning, don’t “save” the 2nd doses for those who got the first dose; get more people a single dose now. 

I don’t agree with that, based on known data. Better to provide the best possible chance of immunity & protection and guarantee people get both doses. Arguably, greater risk results in possibly allowing people to miss their 2nd doses in order to get more people their first dose.

This is the “study”:  https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242

It even states in the “study”: “There may be uncertainty about the duration of protection with a single dose” - ummmm, yeah! And it isn’t there “may be uncertainty”, there is ABSOLUTELY uncertainty about duration of protection! It’s why the 2nd dose is so critical! Let’s check back in 6,9 or 12 months when PROPER studies have been done to make such misleading statements about 1st dose efficacy & effectiveness.

And this is a generic article on why 2 doses of Moderna are needed.

For anyone considering whether or not to get the vaccine because of side effects, I recommend you get all your favourite comfort foods in the day before, cook yourself some meals you can reheat in the microwave, treat yourself to Uber eats if you need it, and let your boss know you may be off sick for a few days.

"Hi, for context, the article wasn’t cherry picked. I follow the work of a lot of virology experts on SM - and this article and topic has been discussed quite a bit over the last few weeks. Topics like - Changing the suggested dosages for Moderna to 50 ug instead of 100 ug based on effectiveness and lots of questions on if the second dose is needed right away or could be delayed. 

I think the numbers are a bit of a moving target, because it feels like these numbers and the advice changes week to week. Totally okay if you don’t agree with the article - But I would ask that you be a little kinder in your response. We are all trying to figure this out, the least we can do is be kind to one another.",lt3gj0,2021-02-26 23:25:22

"Fun thing, after my first shot the count did not improve ( since the test that was taken 3 weeks prior. Btw, the reason I took so many IGG tests is because i was traveling from one country to another and the IGG that showed you had antibodies/were sick was accepted to avoid quarantine - not because I am crazy).
Then, 6 days after my 2nd shot i had to take the IGG again and the count was actually lower to the point that it did not meet the minimum mark to be positive for antibodies. BUT - the test that I was taking seems to not be very relevant for immunization, i will do a spike test in a week when I will have 2+ weeks of my second dose to see if the immunization was achieved.

I had a migraine and it felt like a wave of exhaustion came over me. I wound up taking some NyQuil so I could sleep. By the time I woke up I was feeling better.

"But that needs to be taken with a grain of salt - it essentially says so in the document prior to stating that: “These participants had a median follow-up time of 28 days (range: 1 to 108 days). The small, non-random sample and short median follow-up time limits the interpretation of these results. There appears to be some protection against COVID-19 disease following one dose; however, these data do not provide sufficient information about longer term protection beyond 28 days after a single dose.”",lt3gj0,2021-02-28 14:21:32

“The small, non-random sample and short median follow-up time limits the interpretation of these results.

In other words, the results were varied, averaged, and taken from a very small subset of single dose vaccine recipients. 

Do you have immunity from 1 dose? Maybe. Is it sufficient to alter taking protective measures? Absolutely not. Treat 1 dose administered as having no dose administered and wait until 14 days after dose 2 to have a reasonable expectation of some protection / immunity from COVID-19.",lt3gj0,2021-02-27 01:05:36

Overall two weeks after my second dose I feel great, and the relief I feel now for having immunity greatly outstrips the short term discomfort after the second shot.

I'd guess that the a lot of people who have mild symptoms to the vaccine aren't feeling bothered to post about it online (vs people who do have harder symptoms and something to write about).

Plus, there's not enough data yet to determine whether the vaccines both limit disease AND infection (transmission), thus even more reason to be careful. Many people know this.

"> 1st dose does not and will not confer 92% protection / Immunity for most people.

This statement is false and unsupported by anything you have said and refuted by people actually citing studies.  What you likely intended to say is that no one knows for sure yet whether the first dose actually confers 92% protection.  But not knowing something is true because a sample size is too small is NOT the same as saying the inverse is true.

"You are replying to something from 24 days ago, based on data/studies that were available at that time, 1 study in particular that was quoted within this discussion. That is what I was referencing in my statements - and, at the time - my statements were absolutely factual and true. I meant what I said - including when I said: 

The data does not yet support that.

Other were making claims it did. But it simply did not. Period.

Yes, since that time, a new few studies have come out to show there is ""some"" percentage of effectiveness after 1st dose of both Pfizer/Biotech & Moderna - but each study still varies wildly and there are many unknowns concerning timing & duration. People need to read the fine print of these studies when they cite them (which I did do in earlier post about the main study being cited in this discussion). 

Again, my whole point is - do not treat 1st dose as having ANY ""protection"" for the Moderna vaccine. Wait until 14 days after the 2nd, as directed. 

Quote no one & cite nothing? Ummm - you might want to read the WHOLE discussion. You’re clearly mistaken there.

Again, having read many of the posts and replies in this subreddit, I know for a fact that people have taken false information others have “dropped” (without context or supporting information often) and joyfully accepted it as true.

Millions of people who had influenza or bacterial pneumonia have been killed by improper treatment and negligence, and it was assumed they had ""COVID-19"".

THey have been injecting unknown numbers of blank saline injections into people, and the truth is now be repressed. The state-funded news media and social media platforms, run by CIA In-Q-Tel and NSA in the US and abroad, is covering for the reality that most likely the majority of injections were saline, and they are making it appear to be isolated incidences, with minimal numbers of people receiving blank injections of saline/water. The problem is that in multiple countries and states, we have clear evidence that saline injections were used instead of the actual ""vaccines"" and there is absolutely no way to tell how many were distributed. Many company spokesmen are even back tracking and claiming that they injected not saline, but ""empty"" syringes. There is no way to tell how many people received the injections, but this is another prime example of chaos and confusion by design to spread as much widespread carnage as possible in as short a period of time as humanly imaginable.

Now the gates are open and people are shooting others like never before and that was just the last couple of months. I wish I'd never gotten that 1st dose, it was a month and a half ago and I'm still having terrible reactions that put me down in bed in sheer misery some days. Yesterday was one, that horrible feeling like normal sickness and the severe headache so bad I couldn't do anything but lay and suffer even with tylenol and ibuprofen. I'm back here because I'm still down but able to concentrate here, but I couldn't even eat. I forced fluids, that's one of the only couple of things my doctor told me to do before telling me to call the drugstore I got the shot at. That floored me at first. Now it makes sense. Lab rats need to check in when something is wrong, they want the information, we are guinea pigs, remember this shot had only 6 months testing in lab, we are th ed rest. If you were lucky and got something harmless like saline, like everyone else I saw that took the vaccine, then you are lucky and got a safe batch. I'm not physically well enough to take the second dose most days now, and I was doing fine before. I trusted the science, I thought Fauci was the face of common sense last year when they had us in lockdown. I stayed safe, I have so many masks I was starting to get like Pelosi with her matching masks and mine have the filter pockets. I marked my calendar everywhere I'd go. I still have my states slow covid app on my phone. I got the vaccine as soon as it was open to all ages and Bam it got me the second day, but that wasn't the worst day.

"The first two points are not at all controversial. Masks do work. Obviously not 100% but they help to stop the spread. There‘s tons of literature that confirms this. Also very obvious is that MOST of the transmissions are from symptomatic people. You know, they cough and sneeze a lot more. Not hard too understand and not controversial. The last point is simply a lie. He did not confirm it was man made. Which is a possibility but whatever that would change right now is beyond me. You still don‘t want a pandemic, no matter if it leaked directly out of a bat or out of a lab. So get the vaccine and stop spreading bullshit.

At any point did you happen to skim this subreddit? I just wonder if it could be linked to anxiety over fear of side effects.  I am by no means a medical professional. 

If none of that applies, I read somewhere that there is a website you can submit your side effects to. I know it was on this subreddit,  don't remember where though.

Also not to be an butth0le, but the term you're looking for is 'dissociating' or 'depersonalization'. 'Disassociating' means to stop associating with something or someone. Its a very common mistake and even i didn't know until like a year ago. x",nqgdox,2021-06-02 10:16:33
"Hello. I want to start off by saying everything you feel is valid and real, however, every single symptom you’re listing can very well be explained by anxiety. With all the fear lingering about vaccinations, people are getting extremely worked up and frightened over taking these vaccines (whether they’re consciously aware of it or not) and so once they get the vaccine, they’re looking for any little thing or even sometimes becoming somatic or panicked and “giving themselves” symptoms like this of anxiety. Again, this is not to invalidate what you’re feeling or to say that you’re doing it to yourself because anxiety and panic manifest physically and that’s not your fault, but it seems that’s likely the issue here. Stress can cause flares of IBS and migraine. It is possible that the vaccine is creating a strong immune response which is putting stress on your body which is causing the increase in your migraines and IBS, but again, regular every-day stress and anxiety can also do that. I received my second dose of Moderna in January, I have a hx of several physical and mental illness, I am okay. I was anxious to get the vaccine just because it was so new (I was the first vaccinated batch in my state) so I definitely would understand if that’s where this was stemming from even if you’re not actively, mentally aware, that you felt that way.",nqgdox,2021-06-02 12:40:59

"It’s not really relevant to the vaccination but I felt absolutely the same due to anxiety attacks a few months ago. I have some endocrine disorders along with GERD, and I didn’t know at the time, nothing too serious, but I got so worked up due to the symptoms, I went to every possible specialist just to make sure I’m not having a heart attack or a stroke, or something else that’s serious. My hands and feet were always numb and tingling, even my jaw got locked, I had migraines almost everyday, I had one with visual distortion which terrified me. My head felt like it was always under pressure and my upper back started to hurt too. I also had shortness of breath (my lungs are 100% fine), I couldn’t do anything for more than 15mins, as started having vertigo and my ears started ringing (that was due to my reflux and blood sugar), I had chest pains which made it worse and worse. Please don’t google your symptoms neither, because you’ll think the worse, that fed my anxiety even more. It does get better, I promise. Vitamins (B12, vitamin K and D, magnesium) and pills that help with calming the nerves can be of great help as well. You can also visit your doctor for reassurance because if it’s the vaccine side effects, they’ll surely pass in a week max. I’m taking mine next week and I feel very positive about it as it’s for our own health, having COVID can do worse in the long term. Good luck with everything and remember that it’ll get better!

I'm able to handle it and it goes away in a few seconds when I almost snap myself out of it, but definitely new. 

I also experienced delayed red arm (10 days after the first dose) and have been experiencing light headedness on and off. Nothing I can't handle but definitely aware of feeling a bit different.

For the anxiety overall, and I am an anxious person in general, but what combats that is pranayama breathing, yoga, and meditation. 

I'm not antivax, I've worn a mask, and still do, since this all began, and I socially distance, but I am very scared of getting the second shot.

I have many friends who have received both and are fine, but I am scared. All the data is there and from what I've seen it seems like we're better off with the vax than getting covid so I will be getting it.

For your side effects, some of them can be anxiety induced, but I wouldn't discount some coming from the vaccine. 

You know your body better than anyone. I'd listen to my instincts and do things that can calm you down in the moment (breathing techniques, affirmations, stretches) and the physical stuff related to the vaccine, maybe just give it time, focus on being healthy, light exercise, eating well, and taking any vitamins that could help give you a boost of energy.

"In my experience, first dose wasn't that serious. The headache and fever, chills, the arm pain, the hard breathing problem, and the slight diarrhea were manageable. There was also loss of balance but it wasn't too bad.

My second shot was WORSE and it made me feel like hell. The headache was severe, the fever was very bad that I felt so hot and cold at the same time I had to turn the air-conditioner on, the chills were there as well, the diarrhea was explosive I had to go to the toilet multiple times after I ate a meal so I tried not eating much. The biggest problems that I'm still experiencing right now (it's just 1 week and 3 days since I got shot #2) are loss of balance and the hard to breathe problem. I still can't sleep normally face up and I have to sleep on my side. I also feel very heavy after just one average sized meal, which contributes to the hard to breathe feeling so I only eat once a day right now. 

Anyway I'm recording my daily experiences with this so maybe I'll share it once I'm done this coming Sunday. As far as I know, it takes 2 weeks after the second shot to be ""fully vaccinated"" so I'll just keep writing what happens to that day. Hopefully the breathing problem disappears.

When I first started getting migraines years ago, it started just like that where I just randomly started getting regular bad headaches and migraines with nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.

I had a little indigestion earlier but I did have some Indian food that was spicer than I generally eat and was out in the heat and I suspect that’s more to blame.

Also funny story someone almost fainted at the clinic I went to. They had to lay him down and that psyched me out a bit, but it was fine, didn’t feel the needle, did feel the stuff going in which was an odd feeling but not horrendous",nqihyv,2021-06-03 06:01:14

"I got diarrhea after the first and second shots! The first shot didn't result in severe diarrhea, just one day, but for around 3 weeks, every time I ate a meal, I'd have that poopy feeling within an hour which sometimes led me to the toilet twice a day.

The second shot's diarrhea was worse because it was explosive liquid diarrhea. It was so bad I couldn't eat more than one meal a day, not even snacks. Right now I'm 1 week and 3 days after shot #2 but my stomach's still weird. It's not explosive diarrhea anymore, but it's very unusual because within the hour of eating a meal, I'd get that sensation that I want to poop even though I'm pretty sure there's nothing yet in there to be pooped out. The sensation is diminishing each day so I imagine by Sunday it should be totally gone.

Out of all the side effects, I'm just glad I got diarrhea as one of the main problems instead of cramps. Now those would have been painful!",nq5865,2021-06-02 14:45:40

 I got my 1st shot last Thursday and it wasn't bad. Then like 2 hours later, my arm was aching. And as time went on, it just got worse. By bed time, my arm felt dead. The pain was so bad for me that I would rate it an 8/10 on the pain scale. If 1 is no pain and 10 was ""I'm dying"".

Next day, wasn't that bad. Still hurt but the rash showed up. 3rd day and it was sooo itchy. Like a mosquito bite. It went away only today. So I'm doing well.

"Hi. I struggled with this fear for years and exposure to things that scare you will help. I got the vaccine and experienced zero nausea. From what I hear, fevers can cause nausea so make sure you drink lots of fluids and take some Tylenol or ibuprofen after the shot (I can’t remember which one inhibits the immune system response so check on that!) I think it’s ibuprofen. Also ask your doctor for a script for zofran if you’re really worried but chances are you won’t need it.

If it’s any consolation, COVID itself will make you much sicker than any vaccine response so you are doing yourself a favour by getting the vaccine. I have a lot of friends who are emetophobes and also did just fine.

"My anxiety was pretty bad for the first couple of weeks and then finally returned to normal. I can't remember if I was experiencing increased heartrate, but I know the anxiety aspect was pretty intense. The brain fog/confusion/trouble thinking has taken a lot longer  to improve, and at 6 weeks I still deal with hints of it occasionally, but it's manageable at this point. I've noticed avoiding large amounts of sugar seems to help. 

As for the dizziness, mine was bad and persistent enough that I did have to see a doctor for it. I waited two weeks for it to go away (as some people said theirs subsided at 10 days or so) and then saw my doctor as I was experiencing pretty debilitating vertigo and ear pressure. It felt like I was on a boat all the time. I was diagnosed with Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (the tubes in my ears couldn't drain fluid so it was making me dizzy) and given 7 days of Prednisone, followed by antibiotics for ear pain that started up. (The Prednisone had the added effect of cutting my brain fog by about half.) Now I'm taking Flonase for the next few months to dry up the remaining fluid and feeling mostly better. 

My advice is, depending on how extreme your dizziness is, give it a couple more days and see if it subsides. Some people report temporary dizziness that needs no medical intervention and resolves itself. One thing that may help, as it's helped me over the past few weeks in addition to medication, is sitting upright and sleeping upright as possible. This will make it easier for any fluid to drain from your ears and also allow your brain to compensate for that dizzy sensation and sort of recalibrate itself. If the dizziness doesn't go away on its own, you may need a doctor's help to get to feeling better.",np6nhl,2021-05-31 18:09:27

Seems a strange stance having read more than one news source stating uptake for the vaccine in Hong Kong is extremely low and they will end up disposing of a lot of unused vaccines.

The other thing that comes to mind (and I realize this won't do your possible anxiety any favors, but it may be relevant if it doesn't go away) is that there have been rare reports of heart inflammation in young people after vaccination. It's important to keep in mind that even if that happens to be the case, it seems to respond well to treatment and rest so there's no need to panic. Just monitor your symptoms and try to find ways of relieving any anxiety you may be experiencing - calm breathing, distractions, whatever works for you personally. If the chest pains persist or get worse, have your doctor check you out. They can run tests that will either rule out or identify that inflammation.

"Hi! I tested positive for COVID on Jan 26 of this year. I got my first moderna dose April 28, second dose on May 26. Overall, my vaccination experience was NOWHERE near as bad as having actual COVID. That was rough. You’re halfway there; honestly I would just bite the bullet and go! A couple days of side effects is preferable to full blown covid, right? :)

My experience

First dose - soreness in arm, some fatigue. Very minor headache about 8 hours after, so I popped some tylonel and drank a powerade. Headache was gone within the hour. Woke up the next day perfectly fine. 

Dose 2 - sore arm. slight fatigue, but also pregnant so no clue if it was the vax or general pregnancy fatigue! My sore arm lasted about a day. And it’s nothing comparable to COVID. However, I do have some mental health issues and noticed a few things; on day 2 (May 28) I really struggled to get out of bed because I felt so depressed. There wasn’t anything to trigger it (and again it could be my pregnancy). My spouse was having the same deal though, he woke up with some really bad anxiety and complained about nonstop nightmares thru the night. I had to sit with him while he showered because he was so convinced something bad was going to happen. It’s worn off now, and we’re both feeling better. :) 

No fevers or anything bad honestly. One thing we both did was hydrate. The day before my shot I drank at least 96oz of water. The day of my shot (and the day after) I kept it up, 96oz of water + a powerade a day. I think it helped.

Also I hadn’t really seen the mental health thing mentioned anywhere but I am curious if there’s a correlation. My mom has similar issues and she mentioned really struggling after the second dose of the vax, and almost called off work on days 3 & 4 because she didn’t think she could manage the anxiety. It also went away for her after that.",noehlf,2021-05-31 04:14:05

No. That's normal. The lot number is just whatever batch they opened that day.,nohupd,2021-05-30 23:59:19
Mine did as well.,nohupd,2021-05-30 21:54:24
"It should be fine. I wouldn't think an extra three days would make such a big difference that it wouldn't be effective. I think they just want people to get in as soon as possible so that they're protected. 

Also I found this article: 

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/timing-second-covid-vaccine-doesn-t-need-be-exact-just-n1255136

Which says, ""Creech, who has overseen clinical trials for Moderna, said the vaccines should work as expected, even if the second dose is delayed a month or more than what is recommended.
""Do not panic. Even if it's four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks before you can get that second dose, it's fine from an immune system standpoint,"" he said.""",nobrve,2021-05-30 16:55:25
I live in Canada - we have 12 weeks in between our first and second doses! Same with UK.,nobrve,2021-06-01 23:41:59
"Got my second dose a little over a week ago and I developed shingles on my lower right back about a week after. My lymph nodes at my right groin are swollen and sore as well. Doc said a lot of younger people are having the same issue. So, prescribed Valtrex and we’ll see!",nobm6t,2021-05-30 15:52:20
"I developed swollen lymph nodes at groin/leg between first and second dose, 2 weeks ago, it is slowly disappearing.",nobm6t,2021-05-30 22:30:23
Pro tip - do not touch it / rub it/ poke it. I know it is tempting to always check if its still there - but what you actually do is irritate it. I had my supra clavicular nodes swollen after my first dose and in about 2 weeks they disappeared.,nobm6t,2021-05-31 02:38:48
Mine looked similar. It was hard for me to tell if it was just my skin or the shot bc I'm splotchy anyway lol.,noba29,2021-05-30 17:42:22
"I (24F) received the second dose of Moderna on Friday at 5pm. Immediately after I felt sort of panicky and my heart rate was up but I think it was just from anxiety. A few hours later on Friday I began feeling body aches. The next morning, Saturday, I had chills and body aches and by around 3pm Saturday I had a fever of 102. Woke up this morning, Sunday, feeling pretty much back to normal. No chills, body aches or fever. But, I noticed this red itchy blotch on my arm next to the injection side that’s painful to touch. It feels like a bruise. It’s strange to me that it’s not directly around the injection site.",noba29,2021-05-30 14:37:18
This was my experience almost to the T. Lol..except i.got my shot on a Saturday:) My first shot the Moderna arm went from a big.ole welt looking thing to a red rashy bruise type thing. It was well below my shot site. Doc said gravity was the blame. It basically settled down further.,noba29,2021-05-30 17:44:00

"I'm on week 6 now and still struggling with a bit of brain fog, but it's improved a lot. I had to take steroids for another issue and that seemed to cut the fog by about half (where it wasn't a constant struggle to come up with the words I wanted to use), but aside from that I noticed that cutting down or avoiding sugar seemed to help a lot. Some days I would wake up feeling decent and as soon as I had a soda or something with a lot of sugar, the fog would set in. I don't totally abstain from sugar at this point but still try to avoid things like soda that are loaded with it. As for fatigue, I was feeling that for probably 3 weeks or so. I hope you feel better soon!

Also, forgot to mention, it may have been because I was on different medications for the other issue I was having, but my appetite wasn't great either for several weeks. Recently it's come back with a vengeance and I'm hungry all the time. I think sometimes it just takes people's bodies a while to adjust.",nnrbvr,2021-05-29 21:30:25

"I had swollen and painful lymph nodes on the left side (under my arm and near my collar bone), random muscle spasms and sharp stabbing pains in random places (in my heel for example), I developed a rash that was warmer than the rest of my arm and kept spreading (I put some cold on it and that made it better). I also just felt a bit lethargic and out of energy, kind of sore all over. They lasted about 4-5 days. I was on vacation, but I don't think I would've needed to take sick day if I had been at work, so I don't want you to worry and good luck on your new job.",nnpkxg,2021-05-29 19:09:13

Is that really a symptom,nnthc1,2021-05-30 13:02:17
It was for me. It was noticeable. And different. It started a few hours after I got the shot and lasted through the night even when I felt horrible. Woke up the next day and it was gone and I had the fever etc,nnthc1,2021-05-30 13:07:57
"Should I be worried about this thing, these symptoms are insane",nnthc1,2021-05-30 13:29:19
nope! Everything was done for me in 24 hours and i just slept it off. All of our bodies react differently to medicines. I would be much more afraid of not getting it to be perfectly honest.,nnthc1,2021-05-30 16:32:21

"XRays can show bone spurring, calcifications, and arthritic changes. Limited range of motion is concerning. Listen to your doctor. Get XRs and build evidence. Further testing will include an MRI to show any presence of tissue damage.

Apply warm compresses. It will help.

First shot- totally okay. Just had second shot Wednesday at 11 am. No fever no cold sweats. However- I went to bed at 7 PM Wednesday and slept...without waking more than a 30 seconds... until yesterday (Thursday) at midnight!. 30 hours of straight sleep- I couldn't even tell work I was too tired.

I know a TON of people who have had Moderna and most experience mild symptoms, body aches, low grade fever, fatigue and it only lasted around 12-24 hours for them.

"https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/paged/207/

Been dizzy for 5 weeks now.",nn1glv,2021-05-28 17:31:10
"My dizziness and vertigo started about 4-5 days after the second shot and persisted for weeks. After 2 weeks of waiting for it to go away, I saw a doctor and was diagnosed with Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Basically, the tubes in my ears had become inflamed and couldn't drain fluid, causing dizziness and ear fullness. I was given a 7 day course of Prednisone, which helped, but as soon as I was done with it the dizziness returned, along with ear pain. Then I was given antibiotics for ear infection. After about 8 days of treatment, the dizziness finally relented and most of the ear pain went away. Now (on week 6 since the shot) I'm just dealing with lingering inner ear soreness where my ears are still healing and taking Flonase to hopefully dry up the rest of the remaining fluid. I worry that the infection might return but I'm hoping for the best. 

My advice is to see a doctor if the dizziness doesn't let up. Some people experience dizziness a few days after getting the shot and it resolves itself within 10 days or so, while others (like the people posting in the thread another user linked to) are left suffering with it for weeks. Steroids can help some people so it may be something to talk to your doctor about if it doesn't go away. Another thing that can help is sitting upright and sleeping as upright as possible to allow the fluid to drain from your ears more easily. It also allows your brain to try to correct/recalibrate and compensate for the dizzy sensation. 

I wish you all the best and hope that your symptoms resolve soon. At this point it still may be something that goes away on its own, but if not hopefully a doctor can help you out.",nn1glv,2021-05-28 17:53:35

"I think it’s definitely worth looking into if it’s been happening this long. I had a few pretty bad migraines and joint pain from my 2nd dose the following day, but I felt 100% fine after 48 hours.

In some cases, the vaccine has been known to flare the immune system up more in certain people than it does with others. These are usually the people with long lasting symptoms.",nmq2x4,2021-05-28 12:00:23

I needed a course of Prednisone and then antibiotics for a double ear infection. I'm still dealing with the effects but slowly healing now - I definitely needed a doctor's help to get to this point, though. Some people, especially young people with strong immune responses, just seem to need a little extra help getting their bodies to calm down after getting the shot. It's also possible that it's an unrelated problem, so either way it's best to let a doctor check you out. I hope your symptoms resolve soon and you get to feeling better.",nmq2x4,2021-05-28 16:23:33
"There with you on joint pain. I can't do activities needing a lot of wrist strength or much motion or it starts aching and hurting. Heat therapy makes no dent, yet ice therapy does ease the pain. Tylenol and ibuprofen don't cur the pain. Sometimes medicinal marijuana helps, at least it distracts from. It almost feels like a pinched nerve on top of hand as well. It's officially three weeks since my second shot. All other side effects (minus temp sensitive) are dull or gone. Although, after a week of the deep joint aching and hand/wrist stiffness with inflammation isn't something I can tale much longer. I did not injure myself and space it.

"I had 4 weeks of severe arm, wrist and hand pain after my 1st Moderna. The only thing that alleviated it was Percocet. I finally got tired of feeling wiped out on Percocet & went to the doctor. He gave me prednisone for 2 weeks & it finally resolved. It was horrible. My doctor told me not to get the 2nd Moderna but instead wait a few months until my immune system chilled out. I have celiac & osteoarthritis & the theory is that it caused a major inflammatory response. Unfortunately, I travel for work & some foreign countries require me to be fully vaccinated so instead of Moderna, I got my 2nd dose via Pfizer. Absolutely ZERO side-effects with Pfizer for me. I’m thinking it’s something crappy in Moderna’s delivery system/benign ingredients that set me off (and 2 of my friends got Bell’s Palsy from Moderna) I’m not saying anyone  should do what I did, in fact one won’t be allowed a different 2nd dose in the US (at least for now) but for me it was either that or lose my job.  As I understand ‘it, mix & match’ is much more common in parts of the world where vaccines are scarce & so I went ahead with it. YES I KNOW, TERRIBLE! but at least i’m fully vaccinated & not on the chopping block at work. You def. need to see your doctor & maybe get a course of prednisone & be sure to get doc’s  opinion as to if & when you are to get any ‘boosters’.",nmq2x4,2021-05-30 00:29:47

After two decades of gymnastics and dance, I have arthritis throughout my body and used to be in severe pain, most mornings. It did mildly flare up, for 14 days, after receiving the first Moderna vaccination dose. I avoid taking pain reliever meds unless necessary. The arthritis pain is gone since I started eating Japanese sweet potatoes/yams almost daily. I've been eating Japanese sweet potatoes for two years. If there isn't time to bake sweet potatoes, I make Golden Milk instead. Turmeric does wonders for inflammation. Below are recipes, if you are interested. Best of luck to you!

I hate being an able to draw or write or hold anything. Its been like this for over a week. I make others open stuff. The stiffness of walking and such and stairs will ease up. I experienced major fatigue and over exertion for two and a half weeks after my second shot. Now it's a little draining but no shortness of breath. Right hand/wrist a little better inflammation wise. Left is about the same. Found some relief despite it being tough to do. Very cold ice water in a container big enough to hold enough water past your wrist. It sucks, there's the temperature adjustment and red skin, but once it settles down my finger joints are at ease and my wrist feels a little less...snapable. About to try again. Dip in for a minute at a time, get both sides, dry off and let warm up for fifteen. Repeat at least three times. I feel the circulation getting better.

That being said, I've heard that it ranges. Some people struggle to walk upstairs, others just have a week or two of joint pain, and some have no problems at all. I can drum and walk around fine but notice the pains in my ankles the most when I run. I get pain in the shoulder and elbow that I broke pretty often now. I think my experience is likely just from my shitty, sedentary lifestyle and I'm just noticing it more because of health anxiety.

"37 M. Significant medical pre-existing conditions. Moderna shot.

1st shot April 2nd. Almost immediate Intense nonstop sweating from head, (looked like I had just gotten out of shower for at least 12 hours) vivid nonsensical and noisy hallucinations during sleep, extreme fatigue. Extreme thirst.  2 hour period of intense shaking chills with lung pain during sleep. Was very difficult to stay still while sleeping.  At times I woke up and I had moved multiple feet and even changed laying directions,  when normally I don't move at all.  Felt normal again after 18 or 20 hours. No arm pain whatsoever. 

2nd shot May 7th. Immediate Extremely sore arm (hard to even lift over head) strange feelings of dread, and moderate fatigue for 3 days.

I'm fairly confident I have never had Covid before or after the shot.  I had a MUCH more unpleasant experience with the 1st shot vs 2nd.",nn68o4,2021-05-28 21:03:53

It is different for everyone. I had a sore arm 5 hours in and a low grade fever 37.5 after 28 hours. The fever made me a little heavy headed and I took half a dose of Acetaminophen.

I went to take some ibuprofen and realized I didn’t have any so I had to bare through the night without it and it sucked for sure but it wasn’t the worst thing in the world 

I got fatigued, felt weak, got really cold and had to wrap myself in a blanket, headachey and some body ache and pains. Restless and didn’t sleep well at all. Woke up early the next day and felt a little better after sleep but still crappy 

i was able to get some ibuprofen the next morning and damn it was  HUGE relief once it kicked in, when I got that sweet relief I was able to take a monster nap and felt loads better after waking up.

I'm on birth control as well, was more than a week away from my placeboo week. And ended up not getting my period at all when it was supposed to come.

Are you hydrating enough? That can cause back pain and I know I’ve been needing a lot of liquids. My anxiety has been through the roof too, but I guessed that was due to me being worried about loosing my job after 10 days sick!

"37 M. Significant medical pre-existing conditions. Moderna shot.

1st shot April 2nd. Almost immediate Intense nonstop sweating from head, (looked like I had just gotten out of shower for at least 12 hours) vivid nonsensical and noisy hallucinations during sleep, extreme fatigue. Extreme thirst.  2 hour period of intense shaking chills with lung pain during sleep. Was very difficult to stay still while sleeping.  At times I woke up and I had moved multiple feet and even changed laying directions,  when normally I don't move at all.  Felt normal again after 18 or 20 hours. No arm pain whatsoever. 

2nd shot May 7th. Immediate Extremely sore arm (hard to even lift over head) strange feelings of dread, and moderate fatigue for 3 days.  Fatigue returned strongly 3 days later but only lasted for less than 24 hours.  I have had short fits of extreme water thirst that occur randomly even almost a month after 2nd shot. 

I'm fairly confident I have never had Covid before or after the shot.  I had a MUCH more unpleasant experience with the 1st shot vs 2nd.",nmk9vc,2021-05-28 21:13:30

My arm was sore and a few days later went away.....but the place where they put the shot if you touch around that area it is still tender and for me it feels like down my arm then muscles start to flare up in my arm. It effing sucks. I haven't gone to doctor yet but I wanted to see if anyone has had any issues too right around where there shot was, where it feels like something is still in there type of a thing.",nmhxb8,2021-05-27 23:13:51

My arm hurt after the first dose, then felt better, then a week later I got COVID arm, with the rash etc. Now it feels like I strained it, and esp after I do yoga (I’m taking a break now).

"mRNA is modifying your DNA and getting you cells to produce spike protiens.  You should research spike proteins.


From Modernas web site:
Using mRNA as a medicine is a fundamentally different approach than treating disease with other drug classes.
It plays a fundamental role in human biology. mRNA is the set of instructions by which cells make all proteins and send them to various parts of the body.
mRNA medicines take advantage of normal biological processes to express proteins and create a desired therapeutic effect. This enables the potential treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases, many of which cannot be addressed with current technologies

I was treating with Ibuprofen for the body aches but acetaminophen is what finally saved the day and broke the fever.

I anticipated that my 2nd dose might be worse, even tho I tried my best to be positive about everything. 

It took about 7 hours before the body aches set in. For about 4 hours after my shot I had a euphoric feeling in my head and I just knew when it wore off that the headache was going to creep in, but it didn't. Just body aches for about 24 hours after the 7 hour mark. They were intense, but nothing I couldn't handle. I didn't take advil til I started to feel crappy.

I got my second dose Monday at 9:30 and ran a bunch of errands and my friends surprised me I’ve been feeling a little down so they popped up, was fine all day probably shouldn’t have drank but I felt fine I just noticed my appetite wasn’t right I would try to eat but nothing tasted good like the idea of it was good but three bites in it just wasn’t satisfying so I just kept drinking claws all day was fine then we ordered pizza and it was good finally to eat I ate like 3 slices super fast lmao I got sleepy around 10 and passed out I woke up about 2am in the worst pain of my life body wise, had the chills full blown up, my arm hurt to hell and a nasty stomach ache, I thought at first it was the pizza I ate too much and too fast so I took a shot of baking soda to help the acid and immediately started projectile vomiting, after that I went to lie down again and couldn’t sleep I was just so sick to my stomach, and usually when I’m sick I can just sleep but I just couldn’t sleep at all, I threw up so many times and there was absolutely nothing in me. I just kept drinking water to help me throw up, I thought maybe a cold grape would help because I had hunger pains by 6 am I was so hungry and still throwing up with nothing in me. No sleep just maybe 10 or 15 minutes here or there but I could never get comfortable and I was sweating to death I was so hot. At one point I just threw up to get 30 minutes of sleep because I always felt better after. Finally by 8am still no sleep but my stomach was settling I took two bites of a banana just to get some Tylenol down not on an empty stomach then I finally fell asleep for an hour tossed in pain got up but then again I fell asleep until 11 then I’m was up but severely weak and I ate a piece of toast and went back to sleep for a couple of hours.  

Today is day 3 and I woke up super weak like a little hangover, but my chest was super tight and in pain so I used my inhaler and feel a little better still but got some light housework and I’ve been resting most of the day tho, appetite is slowly coming back but still took it easy.

It's only good that some side effects are noticed because it's like a receipt for its accuracy and shows clear that your body is now prepared to fight the Covid disease! 😊",nlxj8q,2021-05-27 10:05:13
Our stories are the exactly the same! I just got done telling my mom that my chest hurts too. This is the worst... I would do anything to get a solid sleep in. Just at the point where I am getting comfortable is where it hits me again and I have to get water or take some slow breaths to get rid of the nausea. But it doesn’t go away until I throw up. Ugh I am sorry! I hope you start to feel better soon. I don’t regret the vaccine but there were moments today where I questioned it because of the body pain and nausea :(,nlxj8q,2021-05-27 04:41:30
"I definitely felt like that too at one point I was so weak from throwing up just water and bile I couldn’t even grab my phone to call 911 if I ended up so dehydrated, I should have listened to my friend when she said get some pedylite, honestly I smoked a little cbd yesterday to help the stomach pains and it mellowed my stomach out enough to get some broth and tea in me and today I feel better, still weak and feel like I have a mild chest cold

"watch out for a user on here named cock\_punch\_, he will attack you for no good reason, especially if you are on here warning others not to take the second dose. I never took the second, all these symptoms started up after the first, and I am on week 7, and still have issues like migraines, and throwing up after meals, not to mention dizzy spells to the point I need to lay down. If it gets any worse go to the hospital, too many people are dying from this vaccine, or ending up in ER from blood clots.",nlxj8q,2021-05-28 01:10:01

"According to VAERS there are 1805 cases of blood clots with moderna.  Keep in mind only a fraction of these events are being submitted so yes there is a risk with all of them.  The common denominator is the spike protein itself.  Bottom line all the vaccines come with this risk as does covid itself.

The amount of adverse reactions and deaths coming out of this is unprecedented.
I just downloaded the entire VAERS data base from the CDC and its really bad. Too large to send… You can download and look for yourself.
https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html
The amount of Adverse affects – Deaths, Blood clots, Strokes, Heart Attacks, Shingles, Seizures, etc. etc. etc. Is unprecedented.
 
In the YTD 2021 file there’s over 182,000 adverse reactions listed, and 4000 deaths. You can multiply these numbers by at least 10 because: CDC themselves admit that only 1-10% of adverse reactions are actually reported back to VAERS by health professionals. Also, only about 30,000 “events” are normally reported each year to VAERS.

"I'm 41 (female) just received my first shot last Thursday at 3 pm. I felt fine (other than anxiety from my panic disorder). 7 hours afterwards at 10 pm I started to feel pretty fatigued and developed a 99.9 degree temp. It was down to 99.3 by 1 am. I fell asleep and woke up to a normal temp, but still very fatigued. I rested that whole day. The next day I felt pretty normal other than that sore arm. I was able to mow the grass. That night I felt pretty fatigued again. I'm feeling pretty good now. I'm kinda dreading the next shot though as my anxiety/panic disorder REALLY makes this scary and hard for me to do.",nkw9ni,2021-05-25 20:57:52

"48 M and ditto! I have a pretty good sense of humor about my anxiety attacks because I’ve had ‘em since grade school so after the 1st shot when they said “sit over there for 15 minutes” I said “oh is that the designated panic attack zone?” 

I barely felt any anxiety from the first shot and even though the 2nd shot made me miserable the next day I’d say the anxiety attack it triggered was maybe a 3 on a scale of 1-10. It’s not so bad and it’s only about 8-10 hours of feeling like you got hit by a truck.",nkw9ni,2021-05-26 00:17:15
"Oh I'm hoping SO MUCH that I make it through the 2nd dose without it causing TO much trouble. I can handle fever and fatigue, soreness, but it's the possible BAD reactions that scare me. Even though I got through the 1st one with no serious problems..and even though I don't have any known allergies..I still get scared about taking different kinds of medications and THIS one is OFF THE SCALE scary for me 😅🤪. I've been having attacks since I was 18. I kept rambling on about my fear of the vaccine and how I have panic disorder at the pharmacy lol..probably thought I was nuts. At one point I thought it felt like my arm they gave the shot in was ever SO SLIGHTLY tingley. My heart started racing and I was able to get it calmed down. I hate how the smallest things can trigger it.",nkw9ni,2021-05-26 00:38:56

If you haven't seen I can dig it up for you.  

I ask because if this were the case wouldn't there have to be a test for natural antibodies and vaccine derived antibodies?",nkhk2e,2021-05-25 15:39:56

"I really feel for you. I can't say what's wrong, but I can commiserate with my own experience. I've spent a little over a month feeling dizzy, having ear pain and fullness, brain fog, and occasional slight pain behind my left eye or blurred vision. All of this after my second shot. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. I was given 7 days of Prednisone, which helped a lot, but it all came back as soon as I was done taking it (except for the brain fog, which was helped tremendously and isn't as bad now.) I had a lot of ear pain after that so I was given antibiotics - it's helped a lot of the pain but not all of it, and the inflammation level is the same if I don't take ibuprofen or naproxen. Most nights I wake up slightly sick because I can feel the whole room spinning around me. 

I see the doctor again in 3 days but I'm not sure what more they can do for me. I wish I could have more steroids since that seemed to help the most, but I'll probably just be referred to an ENT. We'll see. Either way, I know what it feels like to be waiting for weeks to get better or improve like everyone else has and feel very little progress. I'm beginning to wonder if I'm just stuck like this now but I'm trying to stay positive. I'm not a doctor, but you might consider asking for a course of Prednisone if they'll let you have it. If nothing else it might help your confusion and brain fog. I hope both of us make a full recovery soon.",nkd03y,2021-05-25 02:20:59

I spoke to another person who has suffered w/ similiar pain. It went away for them after 8 weeks. I get scared that we are stuck like this, but I’ve had just about every test imaginable and nothing was found to be wrong. I guess I am a bit ahead of you, I really didn’t start to see an improvement until week 5. Hang on. Keep fighting. This too shall pass.",nkd03y,2021-05-25 03:20:17

Yes! after my first shot about two weeks after or so i had intense anxiety! was having a panic attack every other day.. i will preface this and say that it started after the J&J news so that could be it but still mr anxiety was never THAT bad. it went away after a week in hawaii and i got the 2nd shot and anxiety is normal level nwo,njweu3,2021-05-24 16:46:44
"Yes. I have pretty intense anxiety normally but for the first couple of weeks after my second shot it felt off the charts, and I wasn't even nervous about getting the vaccine. My depression was also worse. Both improved after about two weeks or so. I'm still having some health issues a month later so it's difficult to tell if the increased anxiety I'm still experiencing is because of that but I assume so. 

My mom and my husband both experienced the additional anxiety/depression after their second shots and they were back to normal after a couple of weeks.",njweu3,2021-05-24 17:31:01
I had worse GI problems too after the vaccine! I also have major anxiety so I think that + my PMS contributed to all my side effects being a little worse than they were supposed to. I'm not sure about the panic attacks everyday though... maybe you're subconsciously still afraid of the possible affects of the vaccine? Sometimes I have panic attacks that come on without me even being fully conscious of what triggered them! Hope it gets better soon though! :),njweu3,2021-05-24 17:49:50

Not only did I have side effects from the vaccine, but also the meds. My night time anxiety went through the roof. I couldn't go to sleep. I was scared, on the cusp of crying, the aches and pains occured in my hips and legs, and the meds and shot combined gave me stomach pains. I was freaking out.

"Yes yes yes! 28/F

I will be 3 weeks post vax in 2 days and I've had more panic attacks recently than ever before! 
Right before my 2nd dose and the week after my second dose I was noticing my heart racing (90-95bpm) mostly at night, but some times during the day. It would send me SPIRALING. There have been several nights where I've not been able to fall asleep out of fear of dying in my sleep. The past couple days have been better, but with the news of the moderna and Pfizer vaccines causing heart conditions in teens and young adults I've sent myself into another panic. 
I have a doctors appointment set for Thursday in hopes that I can get some help tackling my anxiety and a check up on my general health for a little peace of mind.

Legit never once in my life had this issue. Not once. Shoulder started about 5 hrs after my vaccine, the wrist was the day after, the hip a few days after. Knees and elbow started last week.

For me, the negative side effects lasted 3 days, with the second day being the worst. That seems to align with what I've read and heard from others, 2-3 days or so of side effects. 

I'm going to say the same thing that I've read from most people. Looking back, I would absolutely do it again. If you had asked me on day 2 when I was extremely nauseous I would have said F no, because when you're in it, it feels like it'll never get better, but it does.

""T cells do not prevent infection, because they kick into action only after a virus has infiltrated the body. But they are important for clearing an infection that has already started. In the case of COVID-19, killer T cells could mean the difference between a mild infection and a severe one that requires hospital treatment, says Annika Karlsson, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “If they are able to kill the virus-infected cells before they spread from the upper respiratory tract, it will influence how sick you feel,” she says. They could also reduce transmission by restricting the amount of virus circulating in an infected person, meaning that the person sheds fewer virus particles into the community.""

""Coronavirus vaccine development has largely focused on antibodies, and for good reason, says immunologist Alessandro Sette at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. Antibodies — particularly those that bind to crucial viral proteins and block infection — can hold the key to ‘sterilizing immunity’, which not only reduces the severity of an illness, but prevents infection altogether.That level of protection is considered the gold standard, but typically it requires large numbers of antibodies, says Sette.

1st shot April 2nd. Almost immediate Intense nonstop sweating from head, (looked like I had just gotten out of shower for at least 12 hours) vivid nonsensical and noisy hallucinations during sleep, extreme fatigue. Extreme thirst.  2 hour period of intense shaking chills with lung pain during sleep. Was very difficult to stay still while sleeping.  At times I woke up and I had moved multiple feet and even changed laying directions,  when normally I don't move at all.  Felt normal again after 18 or 20 hours. No arm pain whatsoever. 

2nd shot May 7th. Immediate Extremely sore arm (hard to even lift over head) strange feelings of dread, and moderate fatigue for 3 days.

"If you have tylenol and advil ready to go(seems like you already took some tylenol preemptively), that will relieve what might inevitability be a low grade fever with some chills. The fever will probably last the length of one dose of tylenol(6 hours?) but if it doesn't, you can always take a 2nd dose of tylenol.

After 24 hours, most people are fine. 

After 2 days for myself, I had red blotches a little below the injection point on my arm but it neither itched or felt hot. It went away 12 hours later.

I had a 101.5 fever and took a Tylenol 500 mg tablet and an Advil 200 mg tablet and felt better after a day. I felt back to normal on day 3 after the 2nd dose. I have a bad back and the 2nd shot made my lower back hurt. After 2 days I was back to baseline though. All my family members under age 62 got a fever from the second shot. Everyone over age 63 didn't get a fever...I glad we all got vaccinated with the mRNA shots and got it over with.

Got my 2nd shot yesterday, felt fatigue and headache throughout the day and last night had a little bit of restless sleep because of headache. Today I called off work and now just chilling in bed, because of fatigue, no headache.

"My friend was born with HIV and was told by her doctor that if she’s truly scared, she could get the first dose of moderna and wait two weeks before traveling. It’s obviously not the best choice, but it still results in about 75% efficacy.

"If you have an autoimmune disease I would think these vaccines can make them worse or create new ones a few months-years from now.

"I had a migraine for 37 days and cognitive problems due to the pain. Saw my primary care doc twice, then to a neurologist who was post Covid and now post vaccine specialist.  This is more common then you think.  I was in the ED twice. 

The neurologist explained that your body is like a ten story building and your brain is the sprinkler system.  When there’s a change your sprinkler system starts going off -creating chemicals and sending out to try and fix.  It will keep going and potentially flood your building.  I didn’t seek treatment for two weeks and my building was “flooded”. I had to go to the ED for IV drugs to knock it out or pull the drain stop.  

He recommended magnesium at night the vitamin B with highest amount of Riboflavin in the AM.  Said there was research results that showed that combination of magnesium and riboflavin was helpful for a lot of people. 

Sorry you’re going through this.  It’s really hard.  But, you’re not alone and it will end.  I still promote the vaccine 100%.  Far better than the alternative!",nig0w7,2021-05-23 10:31:12
Day 90 having the headaches for me.  My neurologist and PCP both said not to get the second shot.  Tests and scans all normal.

For me, it did not get better on its own and I had to go back on prednisone.

\-Extreme nausea started about 14 hours after the 2nd vaccine, and lasted for maybe 10 hours straight. Pepto did nothing. Tums seemed to help a little, but not much. Went out to get gaviscon, did nothing. Took 1 chocolate exlax rectangle since I've had constipation issues in the past which have sometimes given me nausea (but never this bad), and was basically looking for anything to make it better. Surprisingly, it did seem to get better after that. So I don't know if my nausea was from the vaccine or what, but I did have it really badly the next day.",nij8vp,2021-05-22 15:48:41

She was determined to get the second dose which didn't bother her stomach as much but made her heart rate go up to 150 bpm (She also has AFib though). She is old and frail. She went to the ER to get her heart checked out...was kept for observation and released. Her stomach is doing better now. She is on Budspinone ?(spelling incorrect sorry) Crohn's medication and also is on a blood thinner for her AFib. The AFib has nothing to do with her having Crohn's. She got AFib at age 80.

I'd be more worried about the long term side effects.,nigspu,2021-05-23 03:08:02
"In my opinion, if you don't have any bad side effects by week 3 or 4 after the second dose, you should be fine.

I have read some things and it has been shown that the spike protein is still present in the body at about day 30 after the 1st dose, after which it tapers off to negligible levels.

It has been hypothesized, **but not proven,** that the immune system might be killing the cells that the mRNA enters.

It is not known which cells the mRNA enters, but according to one study, trace amounts of mRNA were found in the heart and the brain. Most of the mRNA remains in the arm muscle at the injection site.

If it's true that random cells are dying in order to provide immunity, then it's very likely that any serious side effects you might experience are 1) rare, 2) local - affecting parts of the body closer to the injection site, and 3) short-lived, unless the mRNA happens to enter vital cells such as neurons or heart tissue.

**I believe it is a matter of luck.** Which cells did the mRNA enter? If it entered the wrong ones, you might have a bad time, but this should be rare. The biggest problem is probably joint pain or joint damage, which could mean people will be needing orthopedic surgery at younger ages, if the body does in fact kill the cells the mRNA enters. If the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) is affected, it could cause tinnitus.

**In my opinion there are no long term risks** after the short-term side effects are known. However, short-term side effects will vary from person to person, randomly.",nigspu,2021-05-23 06:15:49

Ok but does j&j have something like sm-102?,nigspu,2021-05-23 00:53:32
Going to clarify for you that sm-102 is simply a lipid molecule (fat). Sometimes sm-102 is mixed with chloroform when used for things other than medicine. The FDA does not allow chloroform mixing when sm-102 is used for medicines and never has. It’s well documented and I believe about a million doctors have reviewed the contents of the vaccine. Don’t let the Q nonsense bug you.,nigspu,2021-05-23 08:11:03
Wow. Is that what is getting everyone sick post vaccine? J&j doesnt have that right?,nigspu,2021-05-23 17:00:46
"Also fake news newsweek seems to disagree with you when it ""debunks"" the sm-102 lol

https://www.newsweek.com/moderna-covid-vaccine-ingredient-conspiracy-theory-debunked-1592553

""According to Moderna, SM-102 is indeed listed among the ingredients of the vaccine""

 ""a mixture of two substances—SM-102 and chloroform. It lists chloroform as the dangerous component, and not SM-102, which is listed as other'""

Is it safe to get the J&J vaccine?,nigspu,2021-05-28 02:34:00
"No. People aren’t technically getting sick. There’s no live or dead viral matter in the moderna or Pfizer. The lipid is wrapped around a  copy of the spike protein itself, which is the novel attribute of the virus. The immune system recognizes the lipid, the cell “eats it,” spits it out, and the protein is remembered from that point. Your immune system fires to attack the protein as an intruder to the body, but it’s not a real virus so there’s nothing to fight. Proteins are benign. Your body is just reacting to the onset of a plausible fight against illness, and that makes you feel crappy. Then it goes away. Your body will forever remember the spike protein, so you should now have no complications with the immune system overproducing antibodies and essentially hurting yourself if you catch covid. Immunity may never happen, but severe illness and death are no longer a major risk. The novel attribute was creating overkill reactions of immune systems turning on people’s own bodies. This fixes that. Hopefully. 

I’ve had no symptoms with moderna on either shot other than a sore arm. Most of my friends have had no issues. Those vocal are the ones with symptoms which makes it seem like everyone has issues, when really many do not. The contents of this vaccine are mostly very clean. The antivax crowd are uneducated. They spew really bad information. I support people choosing for themselves and do not think anyone should be told what to do. No one has to take it if they don’t want to, but spreading fear through really stupid conspiracies is horrible though.",nigspu,2021-05-23 18:46:15

"Ok, I'm prefacing this with: I have experience with biology, and understand a fair bit about vaccines, but I'm not a doctor, or a vaccine expert, so the following is very basic. Let's firstly look at what happens when a virus infects a cell (this is common, we're always fighting something off)...

Virus enters cell and hijacks the nucleus, inserting viral RNA into our DNA, and making that cell create lots and lots of viruses. Viruses need host cells to do this because they cannot replicate by themselves. Eventually the cell then bursts, exploding thousands more virus particles to go and repeat this process. 

When human cells are infected by the virus, they can signal to a type of immune cell, to let them know they are infected (these cells are always checking our normal cells out, and destroying infected cells. Our healthy cells have a protein on their surface which lets the immune cells know they're fine, and to move on). The immune cell destroys the infected cell, preventing more viruses being released. There is also a cascade of interactions with the immune system which kicks off the production of antibodies against the particular bit of virus which was presented by the cell. This is the normal immune response to infection. It happens every time we catch a cold.

And doesn't it sound familiar? Because the beauty of the mRNA vaccines is that we're putting some mRNA into our cells, which they then read and turn into a protein. The protein gets taken to the surface of the cell and the immune system discovers it, and follows the exact same pathway as with a regular infection. The only difference is that all we have after the vaccine is some spike protein, we don't have a full virus. And the spike protein alone is incapable of infecting cells and replicating itself. So there is zero risk of catching covid from the vaccine. 

On to your concerns:

Healthy cells present a type of protein called MHC1. This protein essentially tells the immune system that the cells are ""self"" and they're happy. The spike protein is a different type of protein altogether. Healthy cells will continue to present the ""self"" MHC1. Cells which have not been exposed to the mRNA have literally no mechanism to create more spike protein, so will be presenting normal MHC1. No spike protein, no reason for the immune system to kill the cell. 

Can cells be infected which cause us problems? I think it's incredibly unlikely. I believe there is a possibility, but honestly, I don't know enough about it, and I expect the chances are low. From what another poster linked, the mRNA was taken up by cells at the site of the injection, and by immune cells in the lymphatic system. I mean, that's what the lymph nodes are for, they filter out infection. The paper wrote that spike protein was circulating, not that the mRNA was. And the spike protein is just a lump of protein. It's not doing anything to anyone except hanging around. 

The other consideration is that this is exactly what happens to your body any time you get an infection. Except with an infection, the viral burden is much higher, and the tissues affected are much more widespread. Take covid itself, for example. No vaccine is 100% without risk. But the risks are of a magnitude lower than those risks from exposure to the actual disease. Generally, the risk of a severe reaction to a vaccine is 1 per million doses. I read recently that lung scarring was found on something like 80% of patients who had tested for covid, including those who were totally asymptomatic. 

Tl;Dr; the risks are low, your body won't get confused because it's used to antigen presentation and uses a different protein to signal it's not infected, and our immune system does a pretty awesome job of mopping up any mRNA that wasn't taken up by muscle cells at the injection site. I hope that helps.",nictad,2021-05-22 22:15:20

However, the amount of mRNA found in the muscle injection site, proximal lymph nodes, distal lymph nodes, and spleen were much larger at 5680, 2120, 117, and 87ng/ml, respectively.

We don't know which cells the vaccine enters. We don't know if the cells it enters are attacked and killed by the immune system. It is hypothesized that those cells ARE killed by the immune response, because those cells have a spike on their surface created by the vaccine.

Since we haven't been told what type of lipid was used to coat the mRNA so that it can live long enough inside the body to enter the cells, we can't know whether the mRNA can enter the brain, and we don't know which cells it might affect.

In a similar study on mRNA vaccines (not this one), the mRNA mostly entered the muscles, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. However a small amount was found in the brain in one study.

This vaccine's mRNA has been found in the brain and the heart.

In my opinion, the cells are killed by the immune response, but this has not been proven.

**TLDR: My opinion of what the mRNA vaccine does:**

* injected in the arm
* mRNA enters the body's cells, including the arm muscle, local lymph, distal lymph, liver, spleen, and, in trace amounts, the brain and heart
* the cells which the mRNA enters are instructed by the mRNA to make the spike protein, which they present on their own cell surface
* the immune system identifies the cells that the mRNA entered as foreign, due to the spike protein on those cells' surfaces.
* *Hypothesized: the immune system kills the cells which have a spike protein on their surface*

If the body does kill the cells which take up the mRNA, that would be an easy and simple explanation for why people are experiencing seemingly random side effects. Because the mRNA enters random cells, the side effects will be random. But if enough people get the same vaccine, we will see small groups of people who all have damage to the same areas of the body. This could account for tinnitus symptoms, for example.

**In my opinion, the mRNA vaccines are relatively safe.** It is currently unknown what type of lipid is used in the moderna vaccine, which would go a long way toward telling us which cells the mRNA can enter. I don't believe the infection persists in the body forever. It is probably cleared by the immune response within a few weeks, at most. In very rare instances, the random cells that the mRNA enters might be vital to certain body functions, such as neurons in the brain, or heart tissues, or connective tissues. In those cases, there could be serious side effects, if the immune system kills the cell in question.",nictad,2021-05-23 05:52:02

Oof. So If you get the shot, you have to pray to the RNG gods that:

* A minimized amount of mRNA enters the wrong cells
* A minimal amount of mRNA enters cells near the TMJ, as damage to the TMJ could lead to tinnitus
* You don't have to get one of these shots every year.....

>antigenic protein expression in these \[dendritic\] cells

I don't understand the implications. Aren't dentritic cells supposed to do this?

>S1 antigen production after the initial vaccination can be detected by day one and is present beyond the site of injection and the associated regional lymph nodes.

So the vaccine doesn't remain localized. Hopefully it doesn't cross the BBB.

Edit 2: fortunately, the images in the pdf at the end show that the S1 and Spike levels dramatically decrease after a few days, so any likely problems should show up by week 3-4. This bodes well for long-term studies, as it says the S1 and Spike don't stick around forever.",nictad,2021-05-22 08:53:50
"Thanks for your compliments. I'll spend a bit of time in those subs.

> it’s causing unknown problems for years to come. 

I don't believe there will be long term effects that we haven't already seen. To my knowledge, the mRNA is cleared out relatively quickly. The only time we will see long term affects is if the body is killing the cells that the mRNA enters, and if those cells are vital like neurons, then damage could be permanent to certain areas of the body. In those cases, long term problems might happen. But it won't be because the vaccine is still swimming inside your body. Because it is totally gone by week 3-4, at most. So we only have to fear the randomness of which cells the mRNA reaches and infects.

I have heard various arguments that taking this vaccine will cause problems later, and people who take it might have a harder time fighting against variants. I don't believe these arguments. One specific case said (paraphrasing): ""the immune cells will learn to fight the original spike protein. But if the spike protein changes, those immune cells will still attach to the new spike, preventing your other immune cells from responding effectively, but not destroying the new-spike-virus.""

This doesn't make sense to me because the other immune cells will still recognize the new spike as foreign, and will mount exactly the same response as they would if vaccine-created immune cells weren't in the body. Also, we have seen that the immune response in mRNA-vaccinated people to the new variants are still at high efficacy, so this claim that getting vaccinated will increase mortality to later strains is wrong, so far.",nictad,2021-05-23 06:09:10

"I do care about people's qualifications. Hence why I felt it important to raise that mine were not professional status. Dunning-Kruger is a real phenomenon, and unfortunately, a little knowledge, without the correct depth of understanding, can lead to huge misinformation. 

And, tbh, that's why I believe it's unlikely. The argument of mRNA being able to run rampant across the body's cells, causing unknown but widespread issues sounds so similar to all the arguments I've heard regarding vaccine shedding (which, it is important to note, is not the same as infectivity). It's the same level of ""this is a possibility"" (that vaccine particles could be shed, or that mRNA enters non-target cells), and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if some do (just like viral particles get shed following vaccines) but what I feel is unlikely is that it would cause us problems. (Just like with the shedding argument: shed viral particles do not cause infection except in specific, known cases, such as the rotavirus and live polio vaccines.). I'm currently behind the curve in my own research of the mRNA vaccines, and I'm pretty excited to get back on track and find out more, but what I've read so far seems to indicate that the biggest issues facing those developing the vaccines were not of safety, but of efficacy, because the body has such streamlined methods of breaking down mRNA. Even with the lipid coating, the mRNA itself is not long lived.

We're on, what, hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccine given, and the reporting system is robust. At my vaccination this week, I was informed that should I experience any side effects, they should be reported, and I was given written information about where to report these to. So yes, in the absence of evidence of serious harm, with these large numbers of doses already given, I do believe it's unlikely that non-target cell infection by the tiny doses of mRNA given in the vaccine, will cause serious harm. Is any vaccine 100% safe, no. But is it LIKELY to cause serious problems? The evidence overwhelmingly suggests not, as does our general understanding of the immune response.

You have given me a great push to do some wider reading, so hopefully I can be a little better informed in the near future, as is clear from my post here, I still have a lot of finer research to do. So thank you for that 😊",nictad,2021-05-23 07:00:37
">mRNA enters non-target cells

IMO the target cells are the muscular cells in the arm at the injection site. But this hasn't been said, and the lipid coating isn't perfect yet. I don't believe it is possible to target specific types of cell yet.

>unlikely is that it would cause us problems

I agree, but there is room to be hesitant. It is also unlikely to die from the virus itself if you are young and healthy, and only 10-30% of covid-infected suffer long covid, which typically resolves after 3-6 months. Further, other vaccines are being developed which do not use mRNA, and should therefore pose absolutely no risk to the body's own cells. The risks would be the same as any other traditional vaccine: toxicity from added ingredients, which is rare.

The biggest problems that I believe are or will be widespread are joint pain and joint damage. I am no longer very concerned about autoimmune disease developing, but I don't want people to get tinnitus forever.

I don't understand how shedding would happen (I haven't read much about it), but if it does, it is a welcome thing, because it would effectively lower the dose of mRNA, if those particles don't enter the vaccinated person's cells.

>I do care about people's qualifications. Hence why I felt it important to raise that mine were not professional status. Dunning-Kruger is a real phenomenon, and unfortunately, a little knowledge, without the correct depth of understanding, can lead to huge misinformation.

Personally, I'd rather hear from someone who has experience, interest, or is well read when it comes to learning about reality. First, people can lie for money, especially to further the interests of lobbyists and politicians, although this is probably not very common among people with qualifications. Second, people can get qualifications illegitimately, by bribing school officials, by cheating on tests, or by other means. Third, if the qualified person received it legitimately, it's possible that they don't remember enough of what they learned to have a good opinion on something without reading a lot. Fourth, people with qualifications can be wrong.

I am against the college system in general, aside from intense professions like law, surgery, and engineering. There is far too much information available online in scientific papers and youtube lectures, and offline in textbooks, for anyone else to really need to go to college now. If they study the right things, which involves reading and self-criticism, anyone can get a good education for free, and an unqualified person has the opportunity to know more about any subject than a qualified person does. There are insider benefits to being qualified and working in the field, but unqualified people can also get experience by themselves in many cases, and there are also unqualified people working in many fields -- though whether they are still considered unqualified in that case is up for debate.

Finally, shedding is not what your sentence implies. 1) shedding is a known side effect of viral infection, and of vaccination, but, IMPORTANTLY a shed particle does NOT mean that particle is able to infect another individual (except, as I previously said, in specific, known situations with certain live vaccines- but not all live vaccines shed infectious particles!) 
But shedding would be ever so slightly irrelevant to the mRNA vaccine. It wouldn't be an efficient way to remove the spike protein, compared with the normal immune response, which involves breaking it down with proteolytic enzymes, so I disagree with that statement.

"This article was very difficult to read. They should rename their site ""emotionalbasedscience."" I felt like I walked into a hysterical echo chamber. Get off the Cortico-Hysteria-oids, please, article writers.

Now I finally understand what shedding means -- apparently, in rare cases, live virus vaccines can ""shed"" viruses through certain cells like breastmilk and other body fluids. However this implies that the virus is already inside a cell when it sheds. For mRNA vaccines, if any shedding were to occur, it would be after the mRNA has already entered the person's cells. If such a cell were to enter another person somehow (not sure if that's even possible naturally), it would probably cause little to no harm at all.

"I agree with you regarding shedding. It's a term which has been misappropriated and used incorrectly, causing a lot of fear and confusion.

Shedding is 100% a thing. And we can measure viral particles, or vaccine particles, usually in poop. But shedding is not the same as being able to cause infection. Just because I have tomato DNA in my poop because I ate ketchup with my chips, does not mean I can grow a tomato plant from my stool.

The two notable exceptions to this from vaccines are the live polio vaccine (largely replaced globally by the inactivated one, now), and rotavirus, which is why good hygiene is recommended following a baby's rotavirus immunisation. As far as I'm aware, they are the only vaccines which retain the risk of infection following immunisation. (The live flu vaccine, does not). There are a lot of examples of diseases which remain infectious after shedding, however, but it is important to clarify the infectious part when discussing about shedding.",nictad,2021-05-24 06:57:44

* Dose #1-  3/31/21:  Easy shot in my left arm.  No immediate side effects except for mild fatigue.  Developed ""Covid/Moderna Arm"" about 10 days after the shot - large, inflamed target around injection shot with swelling, warmth, and itching.  This lasted 2+ weeks, but improved quickly after I started taking oral Benadryl and applying Extra Stength Benadryl cream.  I had some stomach issues during this time that could or could not have been related.


* Dose #2-  5/5/21:  Easy shot in right arm.  Within 24 hours, I noticed a difference:  body aches, muscles incredibly tender to the touch, stronger fatigue.  Dental pain and full body itching followed.  I developed a similar reaction to ""Covid arm"" on my right arm, but it only lasted a few days and occurred much quicker.  One noticeable difference was stabbing, hot pinpricks around the vaccination.  Everything improved, aside from the itching and what I thought was a hive appeared on my back.  Deceloped yeast infection.

Prescribed prednisone and fluconazole on 5/17/21, urged to take zyrtec.  Took for a day and a half and the hive area on my back began to hurt terribly.  Went to another doctor appointment on 5/20/21.  I was diagnosed with singles prescribed Valtrex, Norco, and Zofran.  NP told me the full body itching was different.  I just got lucky 😂

After first doses of new medication, I began having panic attacks while sleeping.  These eased up when I added benadryl.

The pain level is SO much lower today 5/21 after five doses of Valtrex.  The rash (shingles) is drying up, things are much more manageable, and I'm looking forward to continued improvement.",nhy8rk,2021-05-22 03:38:14

Don't know how I'm going to work/drive anymore. I live alone. Debating going to ER, but doubt they can do much. Each day is worse than the previous. May not get 2nd.

Update: woken up to 145 pulse. Went to Dr and the blood tests they ran were normal. ESR was close to elevated. Don't know how I will go on like this.",nhy8rk,2021-05-22 12:57:35
"39/Female

Not sure when eligible (Hypothyroidism, obese)

First dose: May 20th: Day 1: right after shot, cold sweat all over, nausea as I waited the 15 minutes, random wrist pain on left hand that was a new kind of pain and very sharp, pins and needles feeling in left arm and hand. A couple of hives appeared on my face. 

Day 2: woke up in sweat but otherwise felt fine,  very sore arm, random shooting wrist pain. Hives are completely gone.

Day 3: woke up in the night with a pounding headache all over my head, especially forehead and back of neck, dry mouth, but arm pain and pins and needles feeling completely gone this morning. 

Editing for Update for Day 3: Nausea progressed to vomiting, no fever on forehead but underarm temp of 101.3. Slept most of the day. Gatorade helped. Feeling much better now! The “First 48”/last 24 of that have been the worst part. 

Days 4+5 Edit: Slight fatigue, tight back and leg muscles, seems worse at night. Other than this, fine and dandy! Thankful that I am halfway there! *High temp was 102.4.

Second dose: June 18th

Not fully vaccinated yet.",nhy8rk,2021-05-22 15:35:02

1st dose 5 days ago, I have been in bed since sleeping around 14 hours a day. Insatiably hungry, headache, aching limbs, elevated pulse, blurred vision, SO IRRITABLE, brain fog. I feel worse on day 5 than any of the others. Not enjoying it at all",nhy8rk,2021-05-22 21:07:57
"Early 30’s, F, Moderna

First dose in early April: Sleepy the first day, Second day I couldn’t move my arm (even with constant arm movement day 1), Third day completely fine... like it was all a bad dream lol

Second dose in early May: Within the first 4 hours my whole body was in pain; if you’ve ever been in a moderate-severe car accident, what you feel the next day is basically what I felt. Took some Tylenol, fell asleep at 9. Woke up at 12am in worse pain, chills. I tried to get up and fell on the floor the pain was so bad. Basically that level of pain continued until Day 4, I barely slept and OTC medication was not helping. I’m now on day 9, and I still have some knee and ankle pain. It’s difficult to stand for more than an hour, but otherwise all symptoms stopped. Day 4 was def when the pain started to dramatically decrease. 

Still worth it IMO! I’m determined to go to the beach this year lol",nhy8rk,2021-05-23 05:02:47

"I was not nervous about the shot and went immediately back to my normal life after the first shot without a second thought. I didn’t realize it was happening or tie it to the vaccine until it was over. I knew I was stressed, but I was stressed over normal things. One example is during that short period I went from one ring camera on my doorbell, to a ring camera on my back door, side door and driveway. Somehow that anxiety included intruders. Now I get to watch cats walk around my driveway at 2 AM.",nhy8rk,2021-05-22 01:04:05

"Thank you. As I live in a tiny town, we are a bit slower on the vaccine train. But it is hoped that June will be the goal of the second dose. If all else fails, it might be July, and it really is ok. The people who really need it in town have gotten fully vaccinated, and that makes my wait comfortable for me to do. The pharmacy where I got my vaccine at, is, thankfully, a larger chain so to speak, and the numbers where high for the first dose so I am thinking they will be pretty close to the actual second dose time, if not off by a few days.

Thank you for starting this thread, it is nice to have straight talk so to speak on what peoples experiences were, and what things others can do to make their experience as good as it can be.",nhy8rk,2021-05-21 21:35:24

We got her to an allergist to confirm she has an allergy to PEG. We did not know about that allergy prior to the injection. 
That said other than the trip to the ER and ambulance ride, and sore arm with red irritation for about 2 weeks, she didn’t have any OTHER issues and by that I mean nothing really long term.",nhy8rk,2021-05-22 01:06:52

"I had two doctors suggest the connection and I didn't believe it, I lined up in January to get it. I would love to have told half the anti-vaxers I work around that I had no problems.

Unfortunately, it's the easiest explanation after a loooong process of diagnosis by exclusion. Does that mean a reaction is 100% the case in my scenario, no, but the explanations are much more convoluted to get to the vaccine didn't play any role.

I admit I would role my eyes at my self had this not occured with me. You know what my goal is though, not to discourage people from getting the vaccine, but getting doctors to learn how to identify and treat this reaction quickly because I believe you could cut down the reaction substantially if that was done. They're missing a perfect opportunity to identify and treat a reaction, make it a nothing burger, so that they can't use it as a talking point on some opinion show.

I am NOT attacking the premise that vaccines are safe, I don't know how many times people automatically jump to that reaction. I am trying to make a reaction even treatable, or safer so to speak.",nigy65,2021-05-22 14:17:45

"I feel like this happens a lot in everyday life, and unfortunately, it's now happening with the vaccine. Maybe something goes wrong, or someone notices something seems different after work has been performed. Maybe it's on their car, or on literally anything. So they blame the most recent thing that happened before they noticed said issue. People become more aware and observant after these types of things, especially after a vaccine that there is some distrust over. The problem is, what they're noticing might not be a new thing at all, it could be totally normal and has always been that way, and they just never noticed because they weren't in this hyperaware state.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Hello! I’m responding as I believe the same thing has happened to me. I got the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine, and about 2weeks later, my ear got a very full feeling, and I couldn’t hear very well. 

Flash forward about 1 month later, after trying decongestants and nasal sprays, I finally go to an ENT specialist. I’m convinced it’s my sinuses/Eustachian tube because I can hear popping, feel like liquid is trapped, and the entire left side of my face in my sinuses feels clogged. It also feels like my Eustachian tube is closed, but I am not sure. I’m wondering at this point if it’s a sinus or ear infection as well. 

The ENT doesn’t really listen to me about my sinuses, but he does a bunch of hearing tests. He tells me I’ve developed sudden onset hearing loss and immediately gives me an IV of steroids. He said he would have put me on oral steroids, but I waited too long, and now they’re trying to salvage my hearing. Needless to say, this minor problem turned out to be a major one. 

They had me do IV steroids 3 days in a row, and the fullness in my ear went away, but I still can’t hear very well. They told me to return in 3 weeks, and if my hearing didn’t return, they would start a series of intratympanic injections for 8 days in a row. 

A week later, I’m still suspecting an ear or sinus infection because of the popping and sinus issue, so I go to the emergency room. The doctor DOES see a small infection (I knew I wasn’t crazy), and gives me ear drop antibiotics. I’m a little bit irritated because I was hoping for strong oral antibiotics. I believe that those would get rid of any sinus or ear infection issue I may have, but living here in Germany, I don’t think they give out antibiotics like that (I’m an American living here). Anyway, I was hoping this would solve my problem, but no. 

Anyway, I don’t know if I have a closed Eustachian tube or if it’s Menieres or something else. In the research I’ve done, it says that these intratympanic shots may help with Eustachian tube dysfunction as well, so no matter what the problem is, I think these shots may help. 

I was scared of getting them at first, but after no changes when taking all the medications, I think this HAS to help. I don’t start getting them until June 10. I will update later on to let you know if they do anything. In the meantime, maybe you could look into this as well? 

I don’t plan on trying to sue because of the shot, as I am pro-vaccine as well, but I think it may have had a hand in triggering the problem. Nothing else in my life had changed.",nhlemu,2021-05-22 18:26:13
"I’m several months out, my right ear is finally calming down after the first vaccine. I still deal with random bouts of dizziness that freak me out.

I had done a round of antibiotics and that didn’t help)",nhlemu,2021-05-23 07:26:30
"My doc has given me the same diagnosis, though I've been dealing with these symptoms for a long time. I've just never had them this bad before.

It 100% could be due to worsening allergies, but it's weird that it's gotten so bad since the vax one month and 4 days ago.

"I'm so sorry to hear that you're having similar issues. I know that it's a really scary position to be in; I'm becoming disheartened that nothing seems to be helping me, but trying to remain positive. The oral steroids I took helped me far more than anything else and kept the inflammation down enough to allow my eustachian tubes to drain to where I was no longer dizzy, but as soon as I quit taking them it felt like I was back where I started. I wish I could just take steroids for a month or so to see if it would have a more permanent effect but I know that they won't prescribe them for longer than I've already taken them. 

I see my doctor again next week and I imagine when I tell him that the antibiotics haven't solved my problem and that I feel the same as I did when I first came in that he'll refer me to an ENT. Maybe at that point they'll explore alternatives like the shots you're talking about. I'm unsettled at the thought of having to resort to more invasive measures but at the same time I've felt miserable for so long that I'm ready to do just about anything if I can feel somewhat normal again. 

Please let me know how it goes for you and if anything helps. A few of the things that have helped me (though only mildly) are:

- taking anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and naproxen 
- hot showers
- doing these ear massages to try to open up the eustachian tubes: https://youtu.be/1-SZ1r1dnho
- sitting upright & sleeping upright as possible
- avoiding sugar, caffeine & dairy 
- drinking plain hot green tea

My doctor also suggested I try the Epley Maneuver for my vertigo, but I've only done it a couple of times and it didn't seem to help much. I'm going to try it again later after taking some naproxen and am hoping for better results. I hope both of us find some relief soon.",nhlemu,2021-05-22 20:53:04

It's really simple: if the spike is the primary pathogenic part of the virus, and the body is reacting to the S2 docking in the ACE2 receptor, you're getting most of the COVID symptoms without the viral replication.

"> It just seems ridiculous to me that anyone would act like an expert on the effects of something we know so little about right now.

I don't like debating either, I'll say this as my last reply. My worry, and from what I've already seen a bit here, is that people will try to blame any medical problem they have after the vaccine, on the vaccine, and I see you doing that. 

I've learned to look at the most simple explanation for the problems someone has. Every single place I check says that allergies are one of the main causes for eustachian tube dysfunction. I know, I know, you've had allergies for awhile, but that doesn't really mean anything. If you got the second shot a month ago it wouldn't still be causing the problems you're having now, so look at other things which can cause the dysfunction. Take decongestants, take mucus thinners, do the forced air thing they mention below. The problem could be continuing because you're not doing the right treatment(s) to get rid of it.

"covid has caused heart attacks, and the vaccine is reactogenic, so it can aggrivate heart issues. I read that it can cause inflammation when trying to find out why i was, also, having horrible heart pain after my shot. Something about fluid around the heart",ni26st,2021-05-23 06:46:18
"We don't know which cells the vaccine enters. We don't know if the cells it enters are attacked and killed by the immune system. It is hypothesized that those cells ARE killed by the immune response, because those cells have a spike on their surface created by the vaccine.

Since we haven't been told what type of lipid was used to coat the mRNA so that it can live long enough inside the body to enter the cells, we can't know whether the mRNA can enter the brain, and we don't know which cells it might affect.

In a similar study on mRNA vaccines (not this one), the mRNA mostly entered the muscles, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. However a small amount was found in the brain in one study.

This vaccine's mRNA has been found in the brain and the heart.

In my opinion, people who are developing tinnitus might have damage to the connections and muscles around the TMJ, the temporomandibular joint. Damage to this area can cause tinnitus.

Taking the moderna vaccine will likely damage your muscles, liver, and spleen. Fortunately, those regenerate. A very small amount might enter your heart and brain. You don't want damage in those areas.

According to the number of reported deaths by heart attack following the vaccine, it's likely very rare that the mRNA expresses spike protein in heart muscle tissue. I don't think headaches are an indication of brain cell damage, but I could be wrong. It might be concerning if that is the case.

I'm hoping the moderna vaccine can't cross the blood-brain barrier, but there's a chance that it can. If it reaches brain cells, there could be neurological damage if the immune system is allowed to kill those cells.

Edit: I'd also like to say that chest pain can also be caused by muscles that aren't the heart, like your chest muscles. So it's not necessarily the heart that's causing the problems. If you're chest breathing, try relaxation exercises and stretching. Meditation and yoga to be specific",ni26st,2021-05-22 09:28:31

I’m not worried about fertility (had both Fallopian tubes removed) but damn am I tired of bleeding out huge clots going on 2 weeks now.

"Appreciate your post. IMO: A lot of women have the right to be concerned because fluctuating hormones and inflammation isn’t just related to the length of your cycle, fertility, or the amount that you might bleed. The fluctuations can impact your likelihood for a blood clot. It’s one of the main reasons why some women get clots on BC. That for me is why I wish we would’ve known more about this ahead of time. I just happen to be on a blood thinner for a clotting disorder, so my blood is thinner than most, but it is concerning. My cycle has been unusual for the last few months since I got vaccinated. Which has caused an enormous amount of regular testing, and blood thinner changing, to ensure I don’t get a clot. I worry about the folks who don’t have the ability to do this - or know where to turn with questions. Just wish we would’ve known more to be able to prepare for this.",nh0c17,2021-05-20 17:49:53

"I for one am thankful that this particular subreddit isn’t as censor-happy as, for example, CovidVaccinated.

It’s refreshing. People need to be open about what different possibilities the future may hold. We need to stop ignoring that these shots are experimental.

Go to clinicaltrials.gov and see for yourselves. Moderna is still in clinical trials until well into 2022. Pfizer is still in clinical trials until well into 2023.

We just don’t have the long term data, so we really don’t know for sure what we can expect.

Not every mRNA shot is the same. The shots that they have been testing with cancer and flu in 2017 are not necessarily going to have the exact same long term effects as the ones used for COVID.

I’m thankful that there are people who are willing to take one for the team and be a part of the experiment, but I think that we need to take a step back and slow down. Many people have already signed up, and if too many sign up, we won’t have a ‘control’ group to compare long-term results with.

>	If anybody wants to “hire” me to let people know its okay to get vaccinated, let me know.

Now you’re blatantly asking people to pay you to shill for the ‘vaccine’? That’s not cool.

If people experience bad side effects, they need to be heard, and we need to pay attention.

Too many places are covering up all of the bad side effects and when people die they say it wasn’t the vaccine. Look in my post history.

A doctor shilling for the vaccine, just like you want to, says this doesn’t cause blood clots. Another doctor says yes they do and others respond to him agreeing with him that they know people who have had blood clots after getting this shot. And then their posts get removed. This is not right at all. This censorship needs to stop and we need to take a step back and think about allowing ourselves to be injected any more than we already have.

The ‘number of deaths’ is not accurate. The media is doing what they have always done. Making us afraid when we shouldn’t be.

I used to be terrified of COVID. I remember when info first began appearing online, I watched what was happening in Wuhan. I saw videos of people dropping dead in the streets.

Later on, it turned out that COVID will not cause you to just drop dead in the streets. It’s not as bad as they made it out to be. The videos that I saw were faked.

Yes, people from India created pyres. That’s nothing new. That’s their culture.

I also saw where reporters used photos of gas leak deaths and put them under headlines ‘COVID deaths’. There’s been a lot of dishonesty from our media.

After they’ve lied to us so many times, why should we continue to believe them?


I know lots of people who have gone out and partied with strangers together with no masks since then, and all were fine. Some people got covid and it was a mild inconvenience for a few days. Nothing like what the media has been reported.

In the YTD 2021 file there’s over 182,000 adverse reactions listed,  and 4000 deaths.

"For me I get the classic “impending doom” feeling, some lightheadedness, and crazy disassociation. 

Working through panic attacks is something I’m still learning to do. I’ve found some deep breathing exercises can help if I catch it early enough. As for the panic attack I had that night, I ran through a mental list of everything I was feeling, and then checked it against the most common side effects of the vaccine. This just helped me convince myself that what I was feeling is completely normal, and I was not dying. It sounds simple, but something I tend to forget about with my anxiety is that while it can have physical symptoms, it is inherently a mental struggle. Really the only way to snap out of it is to THINK yourself out of it. 

If you have the resources, talking with a professional can work wonders. They know more than us and can help you get to the root of your triggers, and work through them. Sorry if this was long winded but I hope it’s a little helpful!",ngis65,2021-05-23 17:39:43

"Hi! 

I totally feel your pain about needle fear and I'm sorry you're having such a stressful time. Needle anxiety is brutal. I've been deathly scared of needles since I was a kid and had a bad experience, and have avoided them like the plague ever since. Unfortunately, an actual plague turned up and I knew I was going to have to get the shot. I got mine on May 13th, and despite all the agonizing I went through beforehand, I promise that I can honestly say to you it wasn't too bad! 

I'm not sure about your allergy and immune system issues, but the nurse who gives you your shot will ask you questions about your health before administering the shot to make sure that it's okay. I can help a bit from an anxiety perspective though! 

\-If you can, book your shot for the morning so that you don't have to spend all day being anxious and waiting.

\-Eat a good meal beforehand. Nothing too greasy, but something that fills your stomach. I personally just had a bagel w/ cream cheese and some orange juice. I skipped my morning coffee because caffeine makes anxiety worse and can make me feel shaky. I'm prone to fainting, but even if you aren't, having a full stomach will make you more comfortable.

\-Have someone drive you to the appointment if you can. Where I am in Canada, I couldn't have anyone accompany me in to the vaxx site because I'm not a minor. I would've loved the moral support holding my hand, but I had to leave him in the car. Still, not needing to drive myself and stress about finding the right place helped a lot.

\-Tell the nurses you're anxious! They will be able to talk you through any fears you're having and offer you support. 

\-I brought a stress ball to squeeze/ w my other hand and an earbud to wear in the other ear while the shot was being done to keep my mind off it.

"I had body aches followed by fatigue (milder than covid but worse than the surrounding week), fever that came and went by night (peaked .2 degrees higher than my covid fever at 100.8), general malaise and some minor brain fog, and some digestive difficulties (brief burst of nausea followed by several days of mild diarrhea after the fever resolved, but I do have IBS mixed type). I also had pretty killer migraines both in my latent period of covid infection and after my vaccine, but that can't be as conclusively linked to my vaccine.

The worst issue for me with the vaccine was terrible shoulder pain and stiffness that is only just starting to resolve almost a month later. I do believe this was partly caused by a bad choice of injection site by the nurse.

But the improvement in my post-covid fatigue and asthma aggravation after the vaccine was incredible and it was sudden. I'm still really fatigued and struggling, but now it's more struggling to have a life outside of work than struggling to keep my job.

It was the typical signs of my anxiety though especially since i had to drive to work alkne in my car that keeps falling apart. 3 days later the tightness is practically gone away but i still have a little twang of pain, only reason im still chalking it to my anxiety because i keep breaking down and crying for NO REASON and when i can move and keep my brain occupied completely i dont notice it until im doing nothing or not keeping my brain occupied... this is also my first ""flu"" shot... kind of ever... im not totally against shots... i just know my immune system is strong, i just didnt wanna have to wait two weeks if i did finally get to do something this summer",ngsg33,2021-05-20 16:36:44
"Oh look. A question I can answer. I deal with anxiety for 3 years now. So last year was difficult. and 2 weeks ago I had a mental break down. I still have it. It wasn't because I got vaccinated or anything like that. I got triggered by something. Today is the first week after since I got my second dose. So. is been over a month since I got my first shot.

Now going to your question. Maybe is a reaction from the vaccine, but I have no papers or research to prove that point. As a person who has anxiety and panic attacks really often I can confirm that the vaccine didn't make me more anxious or less. (well I feel better than I got vaccinated) but I still have a bad case of anxiety. I used to take leaxapro. 20mg for  over a year and it didn't helped me. I decided to go the no medication route.

I also couldn’t sleep on that side and pain kept me up anyway (I’m also a light sleeper). I took ibuprofen and throbbing went away within an hour. Still hurt to lift, but that was gone when I woke up. Haven’t had any effects since, so I feel pretty lucky. Only advice is to not tough out the pain.

I texted my mom and told her how I felt and she said “just wait until tomorrow”, so I was super scared because I don’t know how much more pain I could take lol. My bf and I went to bed and throughout the night I got no sleep. My bf also got the shot the same day as I did and his arm was sore, but not extreme. My arm was throbbing throughout the night and it hurt to even move my fingertips.

Please read what msds is. Everytime you buy chemicals, the vendor needs to send them along or make them accessible to you online. You will even find a msds for table salt (NaCl) and alcohols like ethanol and isopropylalcohol.

The instructions written on it say how to handle the pure (!) chemical. This is meant for labs which handle it gallon-wise. 

The Wikipedia article on sm-102 just mentions luciferase, as using sm-102 encased luciferase m-rna particles are used in some mice experiments. Btw this protein has nothing to with the devil...

Sm-102 has already been used in other products for skin care, medicine,... for years

Chloroform is a solvent widely used in chemical industry and is generally not used in  products for humans. This sm102 in chloroform solution wouldnt be used for human medicine. 

Although chloroform is toxic, it is necessary to use it because it will not alter the substances which are solved in it and is easy to remove. Did i work with it? Yes. Would i drink it or rub it on my skin? No. But the same holds true to a chainsaw...

Extend your research to your shampoos, shower gel and skin care. There are more questionable compounds there.

Source: i'm chemist. If you are interested in chemicals and their impact on humans, i recommend you to study toxicology.

"That’s the thing, though. I didn’t already have my mind made up. I read the claim and then looked into it before making a judgement. Bold claims require bold evidence. I don’t care what your political affiliation is. 

The warning label on this particular chemical exists specifically because of the solvent used. It says so on the PDF document.

But, if you want to poke a dead horse, here’s some info. 

There’s a reason chloroform isn’t used in medicine anymore:

it was discontinued because it had the potential to cause respiratory failure and fatal arrhythmias. 

It also has the potential to damage the liver; in addition to inducing tumors of the liver and kidneys in rodent models. However, that being said, it appears there’s a dose dependent and time dependent relationship here that most likely won’t extend to humans. But, if ANY such risk exists, you can’t bet that a manufacturer or supplier like Cayman Chem is going to list it on the warning label to waive liability in the off chance someone does get hurt handling this substance. 

Here are some references:

https://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/cicad/en/cicad58.pdf

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9356278/

Final thoughts: the warning label on the SM-102 listed on Cayman Chem exists because of the solvent used. It is written clearly. I can screenshot it if you like. Despite the toxicity of chloroform, in anesthetic doses it’s use appears to be safe in humans if you ignore the bit about arrhythmias and respiratory depression (a risk that IS present in clinical dosages).",nfx5r9,2021-05-20 10:16:57

"It’s obviously way better to get the vaccine and take medication to manage symptoms than it is to skip the vaccine, but it seems that ideally letting your immune system deal with it on its own is probably the way to go. Getting the immune response is more or less the whole point of doing it; it’s letting your body figure out how to make the necessary antibodies in a safe space. 

Everybody should obviously do what they have to do, but if you just get a low grade fever and some general inflammation for a day, you’re probably marginally better off just letting your immune system do its thing. Obviously the vaccine is too new to have a definitive answer, but it has been suggested by research that taking drugs to dampen the symptoms of the immune response may dampen the immune response, decrease antibody production.

"Keep in mind this sub and the Pfizer sub got filled with antivaxxers over the last month or so. I literally see them posting in antivax and nonewnormal and other covid denier conspiracy subs. Their goal is to scare people out of getting the vaccine. They share any horror story they find onto every vaccine sub. They do it in the covid support subs too but not as much. So take it with a grain of salt what they say, the VAST majority of people have mild brief symptoms. The scary horror studies I've seen occasionally are sad, but some of them are also antivaxxers. For the ones that are real, that is very sad, but you're more likely to be struck by lightning than to experience that, and the same risk is present for any vaccine. It's about risk vs benefit. You took a tiny risk for a huge benefit. I really wouldn't worry at all if I were you, I would focus on what the first sorta normal thing you plan to do is once you're fully vaccinated (2 weeks after dose 2).",nfivu9,2021-05-19 13:45:37

My friend that got Pfizer had much more severe reactions to it. Second dose (Fever, vomiting, body aches) and my wife was just tired after her Pfizer shots.. It’s really a case by case thing don’t believe anyone telling you what it’s gonna be like cause they are not you.

Be happy for yourself that you didn’t have any side effects but don’t shame other people for having them or trying to get some help!

"If you’re fairly young, there’s a likelihood you’ll get a response from your body’s immune system simply because your body recognizes the foreign antigen and will attack in in spectacular fashion. This sounds cool until you realize you body will increase in temperature(low grade fever) cause your muscles to ache(they’re too busy fighting to care about your joints and muscles) and possible headache and fatigue.
It feels like a catching the flu, temporarily... 

Before you get the shot, have those ridiculous sized water bottles next to your bed, you’ll be drinking a lot of water. Have a digital thermometer next to your bed so you can take readings. Have Tylenol or Advil next to the bed in case temperature is over 101.5. Either have some leftovers ready, order delivery, or heat up frozen meal or can of soup, yo ass ain’t gonna feel like cooking. 5 hours no symptoms? 10 hours no symptoms? Keep waiting... you’ll wake up in the middle of the night feeling hot and achy. 

Symptoms for the most part go away 24-48 hours after you received the vaccine. You just take the next day off and if you have a mama, you can get treated like a king for a day. If you live alone or with a bunch of other roommates who could care less, it’s not a fun experience taking care of yourself.

"First of all, this trial was published in December 2020 and it is now May 2021. A lot has changed throughout the past 5 months and the fact that this is a randomized control trial study design further proves that this isn’t 100% reliable or timely information. Randomized control trials do have its advantages (minimizes bias, comparative, etc), however, there are lots of disadvantages. Some of them that relate to this study in particular is the long trial run – time can result in the loss of relevance as practice has moved on by the time that the trial is published, especially if the sample size of the study is small (like in this study), and is outdated. Furthermore, results may not always mimic real outcomes (ex: inclusion/exclusion criteria; it is a highly controlled setting). The last disadvantage is the logistics; power calculation demands vast sample sizes as I stated earlier, which require more resources from the investigators. If you take a look at Table 15, the sample sizes range from 40-195. The minimum sample size is stated to be 100, as most statisticians agree that 100 is enough to provide meaningful data. When the sample size is small, it means the study has less statistical power and non-parametric tests are utilized to analyze such data. Large sample sizes provide more accurate mean values, identify outliers that could potentially skew the data in a smaller sample size, and provide a smaller margin of error. They did mention that another trial will be published in mid 2021 however, so I would wait for that one as it will be more timely, accurate, and reliable. I got my first dose yesterday (Moderna) and have no side effects besides a sore arm.

My arm was sore for a few days. No other side effects. It’s been about a week and a half since my first shot.,nfikzi,2021-05-18 22:14:23
"I (20f) just got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine yesterday at around 6:45pm with my boyfriend. My parents, grandparents, and most of my friends also got the Moderna vaccine. 

When my parents got the vaccine, it was mid-afternoon and they never complained of any arm pain until the next day. My dad had a sore arm the next day and no other side effects, both my grandparents had a headache almost immediately after they were vaccinated, fatigue, and sore arms the next day as well, and my mom was in tears from the pain and took Advil the next day (I might add that she has a high pain tolerance), and she had a low-grade fever and was tired. I was quite nervous to get mine, but my experience was the complete opposite. 

As I said earlier, I got my first dose yesterday at around 6:45pm as did my bf. I felt completely fine until about 9:30pm when suddenly the fatigue hit me and I had a very sore arm. We went to bed at 10:30 and I could not get comfortable. My bf and I probably got 4-5hrs of sleep last night from waking up in pain, it was very painful for me. I woke up at 2:30 and woke up my bf in tears because I wanted to see if he was in the same amount of pain. He said his was sore, but he could still move his arm. I could not even move my fingertips as this caused me pain. Eventually I fell back asleep and woke up at 6am and throughout the day today, my pain has improved immensely. It is still sore, but I can actually move it and stretch it out a bit. Nothing at all compared to the pain last night. I’m also tired today, but that is likely because I got no sleep last night. 

I also iced my arm for about 20 min this morning when I woke up too, whether or not that has any relation to my healing today. I would highly recommend icing your arm too, as it reduces inflammation. 

It’s crazy how most people have the severe arm pain the next day whereas I had mine 3-12hrs later. I was so scared it would get even worse today because that’s what my parents told me, so I was really dreading today, but I am now 20hrs after my first dose and I am feeling so much better today! Hopefully your experience goes smoothly. If you have an exam, just make sure you get the vaccine on your non-writing arm haha.",nfikzi,2021-05-18 21:16:48

Did they squeeze your arm while administering the shot?,nf3b6j,2021-05-18 11:20:12
That happened to me too. Super hot and swollen for 5 days. All good now.,nf3b6j,2021-05-19 17:05:45

"Ok cause that happened to me with my second shot as well, but the only difference was she squeezed my arm! So wasn’t sure if that’s why.",nf3b6j,2021-05-18 21:05:36
The area is still swollen now but the redness seems like it's going away. It's apparently a delayed allergic reaction so the squeezing probably wouldnt have helped!,nf3b6j,2021-05-19 00:46:01
Makes sense. Just so weird it didn’t happen with my first! Glad it’s getting better,nf3b6j,2021-05-19 04:32:25

I never get a good night's sleep.,nffhfn,2021-05-18 22:37:54
Lack of sleep for 2 nights should not have any major impact on the vaccine's effectiveness. I say keep your appointment and make sure you have time to rest afterwards.,nffhfn,2021-05-18 17:45:49

High anxiety is just my baseline! But yeah you can wait longer if you want.,nexbl1,2021-05-18 04:15:37
I think there's evidence it can be even MORE effective if you wait longer (up to 3 months). I had no side-effects for either dose other than slight soreness in the shoulder.,nexbl1,2021-05-18 04:08:26

was that a side effect from the vaccine?  or you just had anxiety because you were getting the vax,nexbl1,2021-05-18 05:03:09

Since he’s 13, he likes his own time so he was in his room most of the time anyway, but he didn’t “isolate.” He was basically asymptomatic. No one else in the house tested positive. My husband and I were both fully vaccinated, but I also have a 7 year old. We all had three negative tests. The vaccine did its job for me and my husband.",nf7t86,2021-05-18 12:38:08

Younger than 25 and female. My family has a long history of people with thigh length hair. My hair now falls out in clumps even in my sleep.😭😭  I've tried hair growrh products and nothing works.

"Oh shoot, I’m sorry to hear, but happy that nothing serious was found. There is a hair product called Zenagen that my hair stylist recommends to people. It’s not cheap... over 30$ at least but I probably get 2-3 bottles a year.  I just use it to thicken the hair. You have to leave it on 5 minutes though, so you need to be prepared for that. At one point they ran a promotion with a little 5 minute glass that suctions into your shower, very helpful. I find it’s a good time to shave or like floss as you wait. 

Other than that product, my recommendation is to try not to stress too much as that can just further the issue.  Hard to do, but focus on what you can control and just continue to listen to your body for other side effects that may be contributing to the issue.  Worst case, check out some fun wigs—you’ll feel like a whole new gal. Sending you all the good vibes! 💗",nezz44,2021-05-19 14:25:35
My husband has had a similar reaction and it seems like the doctors are just throwing random shit at it. They first said he had scabies (not possible) and gave him cream for that. Then said rickettsia which is treated with doxycycline. He's taking benadryl and using hydrocortisone cream but it's not helping much. We're very frustrated and have been dealing with it for about a week (we are 2 weeks post 2nd shot now).,nf1ob2,2021-05-18 07:49:01
"Nah, the first shot was hardly even any arm pain. With the second he got fever and chills after 18 hrs. Terrible arm pain for about 3 days then a couple days after that cleared up the rash set in. He had fatigue and nausea to accompany the rash. The fatigue has gone away but the rash and nausea are still kicking his butt.",nf1ob2,2021-05-18 11:50:06
Sounds like shingles. Go to r/shingles if you want to know why this is happening to you. Just look around the subreddit you’ll know what I’m saying ..,nf1ob2,2021-05-20 00:27:46
"*My day has come*

NAD, but I get this reaction after almost *every* medication I take. Every. Time.

PCPs, urgent care, and even hospitals all look at it at a normal allergic reaction and treat it with antihistamines and steroids. In my cases, steroids do usually work, but I've developed rather severe side effects to prednisone so try and avoid it at all costs now.

I *finally* got into an allergist and immunologist while covered head to toe in a very similar reaction to what you're describing and they diagnosed me with a Type 4 Hypersensitivity.

The way they described it to me is that it is not a true allergic reaction (immediate, overactive antibodies) but is instead a hypersensitivity (delayed, overactive immune system) and accounts for about 10% of reactions to medications. Since it's not a ""true"" allergy they told me there is no risk of it sending me into anaphylaxis.

Yes it sucks, yes it's uncomfortable, but according to these specialists I saw it won't kill you and will just make your life suck for a bit until it goes away.

I asked why this was so easy for them to diagnose when so many doctors were absolutely stumped over the years and they basically said it's literally their specialty, so it's their job to know it and they weren't surprised at the other doctors responses either.

Edit: typo",nf1ob2,2021-05-18 14:36:21
"That's so strange that they've come up with such off the wall diagnoses.. I can't even imagine why they'd jump to those conclusions.  I hadn't heard of either of those things in a long time!

I'm starting to wonder if the vaccine has triggered some latent autoimmune skin issue or something like shingles, but I don't have any other symptoms right now.

Did he have any issues with the first shot?  That one was a breeze until I developed the ""covid arm"" on day ten.

I'm hoping his condition clears up and that he feels better soon.",nf1ob2,2021-05-18 10:08:11
"I can't tell if the fatigue is coming from the antihistamines or the vaccination at this point, but I'm happy to hear his cleared up.  It surprises me how much the different doses can vary in side effects.  I even had dental pain after the second shot and thought I was nuts until I read about others who had the same issue.  Thankfully that went away!

Glad to have the vaccine, but hoping we all have a resolution of our systems soon.",nf1ob2,2021-05-18 22:57:40
"Thank you so much for pointing me in this direction.  This is crazy.. feels so accurate.. someone mentions feeling like they are having a tattoo with a bee stinging it and I have been up with ""biting pain"" most of the night.  And the fatigue.  I just assumed that it was my reaction to the vaccine or good ol' quarantine era depression hitting a bit harder..

I'm going make an appointment to go into my doctor's office as soon as they open.

Thank you again!!",nf1ob2,2021-05-20 11:48:46
Well damn. That totally sucks.,nf1ob2,2021-05-18 14:45:33
"Wow, every medication?  That sucks so, so much...

This makes a lot of sense.  My allergist/immunologist moved, so my primary care doctor has taken over my care for allergy and asthma issues.  I was wondering if I would have to see a dermatologist, but this makes more sense.

It is definitely uncomfortable, but I'm so glad that the specialists are saying it isn't going to spiral out of control and kill us.  I started wondering if this was shingles and started googling.. doom scrolling anxiety had taken hold in the itchy hours of the morning.

I can't thank you enough for this reply.",nf1ob2,2021-05-18 22:55:01

"I felt like my arm was sore especially if I pressed on it for around 3 weeks after my first shot. Strangely my second shot hasn’t made my arm as sore even though I got a slight rash around injection site.
 
The person who injected my first shot did it super quickly and I kinda think it made the soreness worse. The second shot the guy who did it went super slow and I hated it but my arm was definitely less sore. Do you feel like they gave you the shot quickly? Supposedly it takes 5 seconds to inject and the first one was around 1-2 seconds. Maybe that’s why you’re still sore?",nf0gil,2021-05-18 06:42:41
Sore is an understatement. I wanted to chop my arm off both times. Couldn’t sleep on it or touch it. I asked the nurse who gave it to me when I got my second one and she said it was normal. I almost considered amputation. Mine lasted 5 days.,nf0gil,2021-05-18 12:12:54

"I have a person in my circle who is of nearly the same physicality (healthy 50 you male) that experienced the same thing, a week post vaccine, no prior history/family history, etc, and the doctors said it was a coincidence.   He was doing yard work when his symptoms sent him to the ER.   

I think it is errant to rule out the vaccine and I do believe more will come out about a correlation, in time.",nek72b,2021-05-18 12:45:02
The vaccine is out of your system in a couple of days so I doubt it would be related. It’s not even an attenuated virus but I guess its possible? They haven’t found any evidence for Pfizer or Moderna causing clots. Hope you’re ok.,nek72b,2021-05-17 18:51:22

"This is simply not true. Per the CDC, side effects can be seen up to 6 weeks. And several other countries are investigating blood clots related to the mRNA vaccines.

You should be fine if you wear a mask and just get in and out quickly. You should have some protection from the virus from your first dose and throw in the mask too and you should be good to go.

I have never had panic attacks in the past, but about a week after the shot they started and they were pretty bad. Went to the Dr. and she prescribed me Hydroxzine. These are for allergies/anxiety and they have really helped.

Currently I just feel unbalanced (Which is a side effect of this medication) and and I take one pill before bed and have been doing well. Seems the panic attacks are subsiding and I can control them without medication for the most part. I also was getting some chest pain that I relate to the pain I sometimes get when I get running cramps. That of course makes me think the worse, which brings on these ""panic attacks.""

Shit is weird. I had a sore arm for one day and no other symptoms for a week after my 2nd shot. I will not be getting a booster shot of Moderna, that is for sure.",necdmp,2021-05-17 19:03:36
"Hey Starks, 

Yeah I think me being anxious about the swollen lymph node being cancer didn't help at all. Even after I got confirmation from the doctors yesterday that it isn't cancer and the lab tests came back that my body's just giving off an immune response, I am not sure why I'm still getting these panic attacks. When I had my first panic attack, my doctor ALSO prescribed me with Hydroxzine. I took one the other night and I went from panicking to falling asleep quick, woke up hungry and was able to stomach some food. Then last night, i started having anxiety and panicked again, didn't take the medication, fell asleep. Woke up awhile ago and still feeling that tight feeling in my chest. 

Anyway, I'm a little afraid about getting my second dose. I just want to know how you are feeling now with taking your Hydroxzine, and how are your panic attacks. I just want to feel normal again.",necdmp,2021-05-20 15:49:26
"Morning!

My night attacks lasted about 5 days. I stopped taking Hydroxzine about 5 days ago and just take melatonin to sleep. So far so good! I also went through an EKG and multiple blood tests and everything comes up normal. I really don't think it is all in our heads. I think our immune systems are in overdrive and causing these odd pains which then makes us anxious thinking we are going to die, which in turn makes it worse.

Currently I am sleeping great and just feel uneasy and sometimes dizzy during the day. That improves when I eat or get my mind off the weird body sensations. It is also improving overall (Dizziness starts later, doesn't last long).

Saturday will be my 3 week mark and from what I have seen from other posters seems to be a common time that these symptoms dissipate and disappear entirely.

I would get what I would describe as hot flashes every couple days after my first shot. Basically felt like a small allergic reaction each time, but that also faded after 3 weeks. These night anxiety attacks started a week after my 2nd shot. Had zero symptoms leading up to them and thought I was in the clear.

Some people say the 2nd shot relieves their first shot symptoms, some say they make them worse. Wish I could give you a better answer on if you should get the 2nd shot or not. I will not be taking a moderna booster, that is for sure!

Good luck and hang in there. Keep working on sleeping through your attacks, just tell yourself nothing bad is actually happening. Hydroxzine isn't addictive and doesn't have withdrawal symptoms like SSRI drugs do so don't feel like you NEED to stop taking it. I just did because I want to get over this without the help of drugs and you can get addicted to SSRI (Lexapro)/getting off of them can be terrible. My Dr. prescribed me Lexapro and I have 0 intentions of taking those as I keep getting better. My chest tightness has also gone away.

Keep us updated please!

"Thank you so much for responding. 

I am the same. I think my mother raised me to not do drugs or at least she raised me to be cautious in a way, and that kind of stuck with me growing up. It took a lot of convincing from my best friend and boyfriend to even take the Hemp gummy bears or the Hydroxzine. To at least get the common sense through me that these are there to help me and that it's not bad. I wanted to talk to my mother about what i've been going through because whenever I feel like i'm going through something extremely difficult, she makes me feel better but I know that based on her helicopter type of love for me and her worries being across the globe from me that she will only blow things out of proportions and ask me many questions that will only make me feel worst or panic more.

That actually makes a lot of sense, the whole thing about how the vaccine is sending our bodies' defense system up and how for us that are diagnosed with panic disorder to feel like we are going to die. It brings me hope and joy to know that you are recovering well and is at a better place. You have no idea how much relief your response brings me and I really appreciate it since I don't really have anyone to talk to that can fully understand to a good extent what it is that I'm going through. (Aside from my therapist but that alone is costly per hour). I don't use Reddit very often, but did you read most of the posts you were referring to here too? I think it might help bring me a peace of mind as well. 

I definitely don't think i'd want take the booster either. Unless of course for some odd reason,  i felt obligated to because of society and pressure. :/ 

Yes, i've been religiously using the tools my therapist taught me to help me through this but at this point i dont feel like they are very effective anymore. I am trying my best to sleep through the attacks but I am also worried that sleeping on it doesn't fix it as it will just hit me in the morning as problems unsolved. Arggg the load of   
""what if's"" anxiety makes u think about. Yeah I understand that Hydroxzine isn't addictive and its more like ibuprofen... hits you hard and knocks u out, I just dont enjoy falling asleep and missing out on things to do that's why I try not to take it unless i absolutely have to. 

Thank you , Stark. Im will try to hang on to every word u said and hope for best. Will keep posted once things are looking up again.",necdmp,2021-05-20 16:42:12
"No problem at all. Seeing you and other people on here posting about these ""long-haul"" type symptoms really eased my anxiety. 

/r/CovidVaccinated has a lot of stories similar to ours. Some are good stories (Symptoms improving or going away) and few are bad (months of these symptoms) so don't go too crazy reading the posts there. You can also search for ""Long vaccine symptoms"" or something to the effect on reddit as a whole. Quite a few posts come up.

I appreciate it and again, good luck. It will pass, just try to keep busy to keep your mind off of it. Magnesium supplements were recommended as well and I started taking those. Although I think these are more of a placebo affect, they do actually seem to be helping. The grogginess from Hydroxzine is real, but just try to battle the attacks the best you can before reaching for a pill or two. Don't feel ashamed if you do need to take it, it really does work.",necdmp,2021-05-20 16:53:10

"My panic attacks makes me feel like I’m afraid of everything and think the absolute worst what-ifs. My trigger is death and long term separation. Death upon anyone I love and care about. I was diagnosed with panic disorder after my best friend suicided, and my cat that’s been with me for 8 years passed away. In this post and this situation, I guess the twist was that I thought I was going to die. 

I only resort to medication if I felt like there’s absolutely nothing and no one that can calm me at the most dire moments. But if I’m not using medication, what I do to calm myself is usually hang out with my friends online and play games, take deep breaths, nonstop tell myself that I’m in control that I’m safe, write out everything I was going through and feeling, swaddle myself in my weighted blanket and try to sleep, or make an appointment with my therapist. It’s easier said than done. Panic attacks are the worst. I’m still learning to control mine. I tend to spiral, shake, cry, experience a heartache, and feel like I want to die when it gets really bad.",necdmp,2021-05-23 06:58:04
"It feels like you lose control of your body. You think youre gonna die and its really unpleasant. The best way to control it is to tell yourself its a panic attack and youre fine.

"Thank you so much for sharing. Over the years o have developed anxiety and fear from the same, the passing away of people I know, the passing away of my dog, and now my job. I work at the hospital as a case manager and review medical records so I see what brings people to the hospital along with diagnoses. I realize that I tend to think the worse case scenario when I don’t feel good, but recently it turned out that something was really wrong with me. I had been having headaches almost daily for months along with dizziness and off feeling. I kept putting off in getting checked because ow anted to try everything first such as hydrate myself, stop taking medication that I thought contributed to it. It never subsided but then I thought it was my new norm. However it was just stick in my head that something was wrong and o ended up going to the ER. I ended up finding out that o had a pituitary macroadenoma, which I subsequently had removed. But the entire journey from discovery, to surgery, to post op healing has been very traumatic. I’ve suffered with major anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, and nausea. When I was at my worse, meaning experiencing these symptoms on persistent basis, I reach out to my provider for some medications. I got prescribed Trazadone for maintenance and Xanax for as needed but did not get too many of these pills. I am the same as you, don’t like to take medication or have to rely on it to get relief. Plus I think it causes other problems so I only took them when it was bad, maybe for like three days but no more. Now I’m starting to feel short of breath, with doing little things in the house, sometimes with prolonged standing and sometimes with eating. It’s such a strange feeling because I’m resting and shouldn’t feel that way but have no idea if it is a panic attack or what. Of course I’m thinking g the worse like a pulmonary embolism but I’m trying to use good judgment and don’t want it to be that.",necdmp,2021-05-23 12:51:07

"I also now, reading this, believe them to be side effects.

Both me and my boyfriend keep sneezing (we also had the second dose 3 days ago) and I keep having a congested nose.",nei2q5,2021-05-17 19:51:00
"I would recommend getting a test just in case but otherwise it’s probably just the reaction to the shot. Nurse recommended for me to do that after my smell seemed off. 

I got my second shot 4 days ago on Thursday 230, started feeling foggy at about 830 and then had chills, rough night of sleep, stayed home Friday. From there developed congestion and headache and cough. On Sunday, wake up and can’t really smell and taste is rather dull. Rubbing vicks all over my face and basically nada. So I call nurses hotline she says go get a Covid test. So I get the PCR test as recommended, Comes back today, negative. 

So I talk to a nurse again after the negative test and she said well... you could take another test Wednesday -Thursday. I am Feeling continuously better, but probably only at 80-85%. 

Hoping tomorrow will be better. Things to remember is that 1- it’s allergy season and flu season 2- Covid vaccine results are on bell curve, so we are probably just on the edges.  3- stay hydrated, take NyQuil to sleep. 4 - stay positive. I  been flirting with Covid for so long (husband had it, best friend had it) and no positive yet so I figure this is our dance.",nei2q5,2021-05-18 01:11:38
"44F- I was crazy fatigued after my first shot... It lasted about 2.5 weeks. I was taking multiple naps per day and at times I felt an immediate need to sleep. After that, it went away. I would say just let yourself sleep when you feel you need to if you are able... It should go away soon. I told myself that it just meant that my immune system went into hyperdrive and was using all my energy, which was fine with me.

Funny thing is with my second shot, I'm sleeping way less, but don't feel tired at all.",ne5gre,2021-05-17 05:04:47
Hey! So I felt this way for about 2 weeks. I am fine now!! If that helps at all :) and I have an autoimmune disease. I was also having weird insomnia although I was so tired. Tired and irritable. But it all resided 2 or 2 and a half weeks later! ☺️ maybe vitamin c and I love these hydration packets from Ultima - you can get from Amazon- no sugar keto friendly etc. the second week your body is building up those T cells so it’s normal to feel off. I’d say if after 3/4 weeks it doesn’t reside - then get it checked out!,ne5gre,2021-05-17 07:09:09

I felt awful because I could not sleep and thats all I wanted to do. Its now 930p. Sunday, and I think I am starting to feel better. Temp at 98. It was ruff, but bearable.

I felt like I was hit by a SEMI after the second one lol. Achy and chills for a full day then on and off plus nausea - to the point I was throwing up at night. But day 3 it got better and by 4 I was fine. Was still pretty fatigued for a week or two - but totally fine now!,ne0iho,2021-05-17 07:15:03
"The side effects can be pretty brutal. I got my second shot on Saturday around 3pm. Sometime in the early AMs that night I developed a fever, chills, bad joint and body aches, a headache and nausea. On Sunday I spent the whole day fighting a fever that climbed up to 103, and at that point I took two Tylenol. I hardly ever take Tylenol, it worked pretty quickly, and within a couple hours my fever went back down. Then it came back up last night, took the Tylenol again after it had been 6 hours since the last dose, and I was able to sleep some. I threw up a bit Sunday and didn't eat the whole day because of the nausea, but today I'm able to eat, and still feel feverish but it's not going past 100, and I feel fatigued as hell but my body aches are slowly improving. 

As someone who caught covid from work back in August, I can tell you the couple of days of hell are worth not going through a month of it, and is especially worth not being able to pass this on to your loved ones. Thank you to everybody getting their shots 🙏🏼",ne0iho,2021-05-17 20:41:31

i think it could be a number of different factors, dehydration, maybe he locked his knees while going to the restroom, a vasovagal syncope response, etc. tylenol, water, gatorade, and sleep are your best friends here lol.

we just got the second shot this past saturday 5/15 and happy to report that other than slight chills and fatigue, he’s feeling pretty much 100% today!",ne58fi,2021-05-17 11:08:50
"Monitor your symptoms. People are having these type of reactions to this vaccine. It means your immune system is flaring  up. People have vaccine symptoms a while after they are vaccinated. It usually goes away and fe better the next day.

Everything you describe is consistent (dizziness, feelings of warmth, etc.) While super unpleasant (to put it mildly), it’s not actually dangerous per se (unless you fall on something of course). I was checked out by my PCP etc. to make sure all was ok after my own experience. Lying down, staying hydrated, resting, will help recover. I didn’t experience this after my second shot. Best wishes, this is definitely a scary experience and it’s worth checking in with your doc to make sure nothing else is going on, just in case. Best wishes!",ne58fi,2021-05-17 23:44:50

I got very dizzy and nauseous when my fever spiked about 30 hours after my second dose. I think it’s because I barely ate or drank anything all day. Stay hydrated! And eat what you can.,ne58fi,2021-05-17 19:49:03

"I had a reaction with my first dose of Moderna. I have not had my second dose yet. It was recommended by my Dr to wait until more studies about my neuro reaction come out to the public, before taking second dose. Anyway, I donated blood and still show reactive antibodies from my first dose 12/30/20.  I was also told by an infectious disease Dr. that I am 80% covered with the one dose.

"There is data about to be released from a large uk study that demonstrated a 3x stronger antibody response for people who had their 2nd shot delayed for 3 months.

We knew this would likely be the case for vector vaccines but had no data for mrna vaccines. The uk study used pfizer but we can assume a similar response will be found with moderna.

It is encouraging for places like Canada and the UK where, as mentioned by others, first doses were prioritized. In fact in Canada the 2nd dose delay is 16 weeks!

I was very critical of Canada's gamble to delay 2nd doses for mrna vaccines. Im encouraged by this pending review though. There are still some unanswered questions such as the effect on t/b cells  as well as whether an additional 4 week delay has any impact.

My husband has a similar reaction. He ended up using a sling and I had to help him get dressed because it hurt so much to move. It lasted for a solid couple days.

Maybe take some antihistamine if it’s that worse? That’s what my doctor recommended to me when I got the covid arm 8 days after my first shot. For the swelling. Plus cooling!,ndmbs8,2021-05-16 12:43:53

When my mom gets a flu shot her arms swells up and is red for months! She has some kind of allergic reaction to it. So maybe that’s what’s happening. I would defiantly see a neurologist if you can. Just to rule out any type of brain issues. After my shots I took black seed oil and honey mixed in warm water a couple times a day. Black seed oil is a natural anti inflammatory and it seemed to help me. But I didn’t have the same side effects as you.

"Hang in there! I think the reaction to the vaccine kinda parallels how severe Covid would affect you if actually caught it. I had a severe case of covid in January and am having similar side effects to you with the first shot that I got on Tuesday. Even though I’ve had the fever, chills, headache, nausea, body aches, and heartburn as side effects so far from the vaccine, it feels remarkably less life threatening than when I actually did get covid. Be sure to be drinking lots of water and don’t push yourself too hard while you are recovering!

As my side effects started showing up from the vaccine it was like “oh yes, hello covid, my old friend.” I think you definitely made a good decision to get vaccinated, it may have saved your life or kept you from getting severe complications like pneumonia like i did.",nd9taj,2021-05-15 23:34:54

The no taste/smell for me was the worst i’ve ever had during covid and it seems to be a trademark of it.

I’m pretty sure I had covid in March 2020 but I didn’t qualify for a test at the time so I’ll never truly know. The first vaccine gave me a month of migraines and the second vaccine I had 24 hours of very unpleasant flu-like symptoms (chills, body aches, slight fever, vomiting) but by 36 hours I could function and I’ve only had a few light headaches since then.

B. Sm-102 exists without Chloroform. The chloroform solution is used for shipment and you cannot get it except in solution with chloroform.

"You know what else is highly flammable, yet people safely consume every day? Alcohol. Just don't light the vaccine on fire before you inject it.

As for something that can kill through skin contact... what's the LD50? What's the dose of it that, through skin contact, could kill half of people exposed? It's obviously way, way less than the amount in the vaccine. And plenty of things that are good for you have an LD50, although I don't know what their LD50 for cutaneous exposure would be. But like, Vitamins A, C, and I believe E have an LD50. And we need those. Not just can have them, but need them.

Toxicity is almost always as much about the DOSE as it is about the substance itself. Even too much water can kill you.

They're great family- I nanny for them, and so I know if I need to take Monday off it will be fine. But I can't help feeling kind of pissed cuz I feel like everybody lied to me.

"Our government chose to stagger the second dose due to the lack of available vaccines. At first, due to the US government's vaccine nationalism, we chose to buy our Pfizer vaccines from the companies Belgium plant. This resulted in some delays, especially at first when they were expanding their production capabilities at the plant.

In recent weeks Pfizer and Moderna have started shipping out vaccines from their US plants, which has increased our supply. We've been receiving millions of doses a week in the last month. If we keep this up, the government may reduce the time limit on the second shot.",ndeama,2021-05-16 23:26:11

"Covid’s a nasty bug. Just imagine if you had all these symptoms for at least two weeks on top of developing pneumonia, which feels like half your lungs have been cut out and you are left struggling to breathe for the next couple months with a cough that doesn’t provide any relief. I was lucky enough to recover without being put on a ventilator but I’ve heard people say they would be ok if their death was a result of Covid and I probably had the same mentality before I got it myself. Not anymore. You don’t want Covid to be the way you die.

24+ hours of hell. I was in the same boat. Opposite on the bladder and the other end though. I had to go so bad and barely could. Fever, cold sweats, felt like someone beat my arm with a bat. I'd get goose bumps every couple of seconds and even that would hurt. My resting heartrate was over 100 and I kept getting palpitations. Nausea on and off.

I was so worried about that. I am 35/f and heard it affects women more. That's interesting it affected you this way. I also do jiu jitsu and live an active lifestyle. I am vegan and made sure to hydrate before and after. All I got after my second shot was itchiness at the injection site oh and I experienced increased hunger. I'm glad you got it! Everyone is different and you're going to be fine. I do think people should get their second shot regardless.  Thank you for getting it!,nctt9d,2021-05-15 23:48:02

"It’s been over 24 hours since my 2nd dose and when I woke up in the morning I felt paralyzed, my body was so weak. it’s been this way throughout the day but I’ve been able to move around a bit to eat and hydrate etc. I would say prepare by calling off the day after for sure, maybe even the following day in case. My roommate had little to none symptoms so maybe you’ll get lucky. Also, drink lots and lots of fluids. I got a bunch of water with electrolytes, vitamin waters, body armor drinks, etc. after your shot, do a bunch of arm circles for the 10-15 min waiting period. I did this and felt little to none discomfort after the first dose, but with the second one I do feel pain and discomfort, though I feel it would’ve been worse if I hadn’t done the arm circles. Also, after your shot, take a pain reliever. Do this the day after as well. Over all just get a lot of rest, eat healthy and make sure you’re extra hydrated!",nd8fua,2021-05-16 03:41:25

"I had them for ten days. And a couple of mornings after I finally feel a bit normal now like the sunlight wont kill me anymore. Hang in there. I definitely felt like it was just never going to end. It did. Its going to end. Until then, avoid triggers like fluorescent lights wear sunglasses use bluelight or light sensitivity on all devices. Remove scented items even laundry scents can trigger one. Also remove noises like alarms notifications and such and let those around you what you are going through and what you need from them. Many people don't understand how bad it feels so you have to tell them. I made sure to have electrolytes potassium and magnesium (powerade gatorade or coconut water or vitamins). I think it does help a little. Hot showers helped me but everyone is different, neck massager. It won't make them go away for sure but I think it keeps from getting worse. Seeing as you have to work, Excedrine extra strength works so do menstrual pain pills but eat a lot of food drink plenty of water. Avoid caffeine, excedrine already as caffeine and consuming more makes it worse. Taking pills everyday hurt my stomach so take it easy if you do take them. Im sorry you have to suffer these symptoms I know how debilitating they can be. Just take care rest as much as you can.",ncts9h,2021-05-15 12:11:12
"You might consider asking your doctor for a migraine medication, such as Imitrex. My migraines stopped responding to Aleve about a year ago and now I take Imitrex as needed for them.

35F. Getting my second dose next week. I got my first dose around noon on a Wednesday, that night I felt fatigued. Arm hurt like heck for a few days after. I got “COVID arm” (red rash near the injection site) 8 days after and it lasted about 5 days. Worth it.

My 73 y/o mom had no side effects from the first dose.",nchaw6,2021-05-15 03:01:07

I had COVID last March (\~23rd March 2020) so that may have had an impact. The symptoms I had were mainly dizziness, fatigue, arm pain and quite intense nausea (could've been exaggerated by the anxiety, but im not sure). Im feeling really good that I got it, and im thankful for all those who commented on the post. And my GF for keeping me calm and sane! Will check back with the 2nd! Good luck to all -- get the damn vaccine!",nchaw6,2021-05-20 16:28:35

"Please consider making a VAERS report. Even if you feel it is not severe, it is an unrecognized symptom (despite being more present in the vaccine arm vs the placebo arm of most trials). Recognition, leads to treatment. My feeling is with this recognition this reaction for the more severe side could be cut to a third in length and severity or more.

"Just recently I've found out that the immune system is likely killing the cells that the mRNA uses to make spike proteins. Because the cell makes a spike on its own surface, it is hypothesized that the entire cell is killed during the immune response.

Most of the mRNA is found at injection site (arm muscles), but can spread to far lymph nodes, and organs like the liver and spleen. It's possible that the random cells your vaccine used were around the TMJ.

From a very small research, I found that TMJ (jaw) injuries and damage can cause tinnitus. I'm not sure if TMJ damage can be healed because it might be connective tissue or muscular damage. But, maybe there is a way to strengthen the jaw muscles with exercise. I wonder if that could relieve tinnitus symptoms.

I’m normally 97.5F, and my fever got up to 103F.  That was *with* rotating Tylenol, ibuprofen and naproxen. The morning after the shot, I was literally sobbing in pain trying to walk to the bathroom. My joints and muscles felt like I fell off the roof and bounced. I’m not immunocompromised, but I do have an autoimmune disorder.

>I myself have been seriously injured by the Pfizer Covid vaccine. 30 minutes after receiving it, I developed severe burning in my face, dizziness and a very high spike in blood pressure. For the past nine weeks, I have had severe paresthesias in my face, tongue, chest wall and limbs as well as dizziness, headaches, tremor and weakness. I am incapacitated and fear that I will not recover. I have been unable to find physicians in the community who know anything about this or how to treat me.  
>  
>\--------------  
>  
>I am in my 11th week of illness from the vaccine now and have ongoing paresthesias. I had a consult with the neurology department at the NIH. They are seeing many people with similar reactions and believe it is similar to what the long haul Covid patients have. They believe the vaccine can cause a sensory polyneuropathy. The antibodies produced to the covid spike protein triggered by the vaccine cross- react with antigens on nerve cells and cause a neuropathy. They believe I will recover slowly and it may take months or a year. This is the first explanation I have had and validation that this is a known complication of the vaccines.

"Same. I had a sore arm after the first but was able to workout next day and the after the second I had a very slight sore arm less than the first shot, increased hunger, and itchiness at the injection site but no rash.

You have to get the shot. Just think of the possible alternatives if you get sick. That little Moderna shots just a pipsqueak compared to all the horse needles they’ll poke you w if you get sick!,nbzsb9,2021-05-14 08:49:59

Stay very hydrated. Drink sports drinks if available. Move your arm as much as you can. And think of how worth it getting the vaccine is. You got this!,nbzsb9,2021-05-14 05:31:54
Maybe indulge in a little incentive afterward as a reward for doing it. Stop at your favorite bakery for a treat or pick up a book you've been wanting.,nbzsb9,2021-05-14 05:34:23
Lots and lots of Gatorade!!! It really helps,nbzsb9,2021-05-14 05:41:57
I was very nervous before my second and it turned out the anxiety was the worst of everything I experienced aha! Once you get past the 15 mins waiting you can just go home relieved and chill out and relax! (If you don't have to work) Anyway good luck.,nbzsb9,2021-05-14 05:59:22

"Get excited for it. What you're doing is something amazing, helping yourself and others. Treat yourself to ice cream or something you like on the way home. 

Definitely hydrate, before and after. I recommend pedialyte! Even 2-3 days after I was still feeling dehydrated and this helped. 

Remember: symptoms aren't guaranteed. Take it hour by hour, rest and get cozy. In general your symptoms only last like 12 hours max. 

All I had was a headache and a fever, started 15 hours after my shot and went away 12 hours after that. It was actually nice to have a day in bed doing nothing lol.",nbzsb9,2021-05-14 13:35:59

I felt fine and went to sleep.  I woke up about 2 AM with body soreness and slight cold shivers.  Was wicked tired the next day, but chalk that up to being up for several hours due to body aches.  I'd recommend a Tylenol before bed the first night.  Felt super after about 15 hours.  It was hard to explain.  I felt like I hide a light flu without actually being sick.  Odd, really.",nbzsb9,2021-05-15 01:13:59

"I had different side effects after the second dose then  I did after the first but the number and intensity of effects were the same both times. I was too sick to work for a couple days after both but wasn't completely miserable either time. First dose I couldn't lift my arm the day after and I felt like I had run a marathon. I was tired and I had nerve pain due to old injuries flaring up. The nerve pain was extremely sporadic so it didn't bother me much. I also weirdly felt like I had a sunburn on my back. Second dose I only had mild pain in my arm, a low grade fever and when I tried to sleep I was super restless. I couldn't stop moving my body. I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin like I'd drunk ten cups of coffee. It was weird. Both times I found my symptoms to be reassuring cuz it meant my body was doing what it was supposed to do. Oh, also, I had a high rate and my tongue tingled after the second dose.
Compared to the range of experiences I've read here I'd consider my symptoms to be moderate.

I have had that same mark, but am sure it must be my cat...(Let us hope!)
As per your Moderna Dent, I can not venture to say, but that from my experience as an MA, any shot can react sometimes in an unexpected way, but I have never seen any long term effect. I think you’re OK. 
If there are aliens hovering about, I don’t think you want them to like you, as they might be looking for dinner, who knows? Please though, don’t worry about my poor jokes!",nc4m57,2021-05-14 20:22:20
My gums bled slightly for 3-4 days after I had my first Moderna dose. I had dental work done five days prior to being vaccinated and did not bleed until the evening of the vaccination.

We all drank a lot of water prior to both shots.   Really a “non event” for us.

Mine was small rash at injection site, and more significantly, palmar rash (right at the bottom of palms on pads and above wrist, not center of palms).  Like photo of palmar rash subject noted above, I had no reaction 2nd time.  Arm was a little sore night 1 and 2, and that's it. Insomnia, and a strange feeling on my tongue was probably me being a freak, and over-reacting, a silly head-trip.  

\*This is what interested me most in my round2 experience.  2nd shot the Technician administered shot with a bandage like this.  Tech used alcohol swab to clean injection site, applied this bandage, injected dose, and finiished.   [https://imgur.com/XHpZtvt](https://imgur.com/XHpZtvt)   The first dose, alcohol swab to clean, injection, then covered with regular band-aid.  The red/rash at injection site was shaped just like the square cotton part on typical bandage from 1st dose.   

For anyone who sees this, those circular bandages intended for vaccines seemingly work great!  Not even a mark, nothing.  Maybe simple coincidence, but maybe they help in some capacity.

Thanks again Niki, and as you noted, stay hydrated and rememeber millions of people get this vaccine w/o incident.  As you mentioned b4, have shot2 in opposite arm, and you'll be fine.  Many articles online say ones body is responding well by having a late reaction (over 4 hours post shot administration), so ones 2nd dose is often easier w/ minimal reaction if you had a reaction to 1st. :)

Lastly, to anyone who has/had CovidArm from Pfizer, I did find a handful of articles noting Pfizer Vaccine can also cause Covid-Arm (but is more common from Moderna).  Sorry for lengthy post, hope it helps anyone who is super spooked like I was.  :)",nbqf6n,2021-05-17 21:52:03
Two weeks ago I got the 2nd Moderna vaccine. Yesterday I was working out and doing Lat pull downs for my arms. Last night I woke up with discomfort in the area where I got my vaccine shots. I’m guessing this was “Covid arm.” Anyone else have a similar response?,nbq2su,2021-05-13 21:09:18
Discomfort? How would you describe that? I got a blood pressure cuff squeezed on my arm where I got the shot maybe a week and a half later and my arm KILLED after that. I mean I could barely move it that night. Idk what it does to our muscles. lol,nbq2su,2021-05-13 21:28:56
It felt just like when I got the shot. Arm was very sore. Could not sleep on it.,nbq2su,2021-05-13 22:25:06
I still have injection site pain 3 weeks after my first dose. I feel it more when I strain the muscle. So weird. I heard from a lady in the lobby at my GI appointment last week that she was experiencing this as well. My guess is prolonged inflammation. I'll update with info after my appointment tomorrow to get these on going symptoms checked.,nbq2su,2021-05-14 05:43:24
Slept well last night with no discomfort. The real test will be if this issue happens again after I work out,nbq2su,2021-05-14 12:24:14

"I get migraines (take Relpax) got both doses of Moderna and neither triggered a migraine. I did have a headache after the second which was likely due to not drinking enough and not having anything to eat because I just wasn’t hungry. Stay hydrated, drink whatever your equivalent to Gatorade is and make sure you have something easy to eat like soup so you at least have something. I had 0 side effects after my first other than a slightly sore arm. My second was a bit rough but it only lasted a day and then I was fine.  It’s worth the aggravation to be fully vaccinated. Good luck.",nbp9nj,2021-05-13 20:47:36
I get migraines as well and neither of my Moderna shots gave me a migraine. Kind of surprising because I get them quite often. I take Imitrex fairly frequently. I don't like to but nothing else helps my migraines now.,nbp9nj,2021-05-13 21:18:29

"I don’t experience auras with my migraines but my mom does. She got Pfizer and no side effects, I got Moderna and had a light migraine on day two after my first shot. Could have been a coincidence and not the vaccine. Haven’t had the second shot yet.",nbp9nj,2021-05-14 02:04:23
"43f, also get migraines but they are always manageable with over-the-counter medicine. I rarely get them to the point I have to lay down in a dark room. My 2nd dose gave me a bad one, though. I woke up the next day with the worst migraine I've ever had, with a high sensitivity to scent. It was so bad I threw up, which has never happened for me. BUT... I felt a lot better after throwing up and taking a short nap. I did have a manageable migraine the rest of that day and into the next 2 days---but it did decrease gradually. I will say though, that the worst part of it was fast, and it was still worth it. The relief from having some extra protection against this virus is great. I hope this doesn't discourage you! Just be prepared.",nbp9nj,2021-05-14 03:27:41
"Just wanted to update real quick:  
I had my first shot of Moderna around 3 hours ago and have had no negative side-effects other than a slightly sore arm and a bit of a soreness in my right leg but feeling pretty good otherwise.  
Hope that it'll stay this way but knocking on wood :)  
Thank you all for your hopeful replies, they really helped and overall i can recommend getting the vaccines to everyone that is able to, it's a very quick process and protecting others and yourself is in itself wort much more than some side-effects may be.",nbp9nj,2021-05-15 18:43:16

I'm feeling much better already from just hearing from a feelow migraine sufferer and your experience sounds pretty much like previous vaccinations i've had (though the last has been a while back).

"I had migraines for 3.5 weeks after my first Moderna dose. I consulted my general practitioner over Patient Portal and he seemed unconcerned, saying headaches are commonly reported after the vaccine. 

After 10 days of migraines I saw my OB (I'm pregnant) and she prescribed a migraine medication for me. 

Then a week later I saw a neurologist, who said that the headaches from the vaccine and he's seen someone who had headaches for 6 weeks after their vaccine. Then he talked in circles about how he doesn't know anything about prescribing meds to pregnant patients, so my OB would know better than he does, but preggos shouldn't have ANY pain meds except for Tylenol. 

Eventually my headaches subsided and went away almost entirely. I got my second dose on schedule. After the second dose I had chills and body aches and nausea for 24 hours and then I got better. I'm only getting a few mild headaches here and there now. I think I've taken Tylenol for them only twice in the last week.

All this to say, feel free to consult a doctor (or 3) and don't hesitate to ask for higher strength medicine if you can't function without it (I couldn't). However, also be prepared for some doctors to assure you it's normal and urge you to stick it out.",narq1o,2021-05-12 21:40:28
"I'm officially on day 7 post 2nd vax. 
My only side effect with the first was covid arm. 
I haven't had sinus issues, but I've had dull headaches, usually towards the end of the day since my 2nd vax. 
I've also been experiencing dizzy/light-headedness since 2nd vax. It's not extreme dizziness, but scolling thru my phone makes my head feel weird. I bartend at a big restaurant. Making quick movements or entering the kitchen going from dark outside seating to the bright kitchen lights seems to irritate my dizziness. It's not affecting my day to day life horrendously, but it is irritating and I'm ready to feel 100 again. 

I have a friend who works HR at a big trucking company and she's been in charge of the covid unit for the past 13 months. She said the headaches and dizziness seemed to be pretty common after vaccinations. I reached out yesterday because I was starting to worry & she told me she has had people dealing with those side effects for weeks after vaccination. 

I've been pro vax since the beginning. I'm not upset about getting the vax at all. I do feel better especially working face to face with the unmasked public. I just wish I knew why the 2nd vax has affected me this way.

The dizzy spells is horrible.. Its like someone spinning my brain around my head... Only for a few seconds but it's horrible",narq1o,2021-05-13 14:35:31

"I had the virus in January and barely kept myself from being hospitalized and put on a ventilator. I decided to get a Moderna shot yesterday and your nurse is exactly right. My symptoms so far have been almost exactly like they were when I got the virus minus a few critical key differences. My head doesn’t feel like it’s in a vice ready to explode, my sinuses are staying clear, my lungs aren’t filling up with fluid, and I haven’t lost my sense of taste/smell. So far on the vaccine, I’ve had a high fever (103.8), chills, aches and pains, and nausea in the same intensity and progression that it happened when I got the real thing. I’d much rather have this than getting pneumonia again and the intense sinus pressure.",narq1o,2021-05-13 01:59:48

29F - I didn't had covid, and no medical problems, I do a lot of sports and have a healthy diet. I drank a huge amount of liquids before and after the 2nd shot, focused even more on diet, but apparently that didn't helped.

"F/40 I had all the symptoms of cramps, pms for 2 weeks and nothing got the shot 4/20 was supposed to have my period a week later Nope... finally started yesterday 5/11 so far it's been pretty horrible with major cramps and let's just say I can only sit at this moment... leaving out the details... ugh I just want to curl into a ball right now.",na6a5w,2021-05-12 19:57:07
I am 2 years post menopausal & started lightly bleeding for almost 2 weeks after I received my 1st moderna vaccine.,na6a5w,2021-05-13 13:53:35

"Mine came 8 days after first and 12 hrs after second. I still have it now 4 days strong. Took antihistamines this morning. It’s annoying. Burning, itching, swelling, warm to the touch, and it moves.",na29jh,2021-05-12 05:10:56
"I had this also. Showed up on day 8 after dose 1. It will go away in a couple of days. Meanwhile, Benadryl and some anti-itch cream will help.",na29jh,2021-05-11 18:39:06
I had this about a week after my first shot. Then within a couple hours with my second dose! Totally worth it though!,na29jh,2021-05-11 20:45:38
So this has since gone away and everything is back to normal it was there for a solid 48 hours and disappeared like nothing ever happened! Just wanted to update anyone who might see this and have been scared off getting the shot. I would do this shot sequence over and over if I had to.. nothing I went through was worse than covid or the time I have lost with all of my friends and family ... 8-9 more days and I will be fully vaccinated and have lost a lot of weight on my shoulders of this damn pandemic!,na29jh,2021-05-12 20:18:25
Didn't they squeeze you too low?,na29jh,2021-05-12 09:52:11
Does anyone know why this happens?,na29jh,2021-05-13 00:31:12
It started to show on my arm about 4 hours after the shot lol I must have a great immune system! Lol,na29jh,2021-05-11 18:41:34
That what I said 10/10 would do it again... my first shot I didn’t have any symptoms at all including not even a sore arm.. this one was a bit different but I didn’t have chills or nausea like a lot of other people so I consider myself to be lucky,na29jh,2021-05-11 20:49:18
"Not sure that is about the quality of our immune system, is a possible 2nd reaction I think",na29jh,2021-05-29 22:43:47
You might be right all I know is that this was very short lived and if I had to do it again I would. Nothing I experienced was anything less than tolerable,na29jh,2021-06-01 19:06:13

It was like a mild case of the flu, that achy muscles and joint feeling but not as bad and  at least I expected it.  If I woke up feeling like that for no reason I’d panic and be getting a covid test.

Did you have side effects from both shots?,n9ur4m,2021-05-12 13:21:14
"Well, my first shot?  I was amazed at how much it hurt. I wished I hadn't chosen my left (non-dominant) arm, because I sleep on my left side and it was a bummer.  The second day, I had a really weird nap. That's it. 

But I had a really interesting reaction to the vaccine...  
10 days after my second shot that was only a sore arm until that point...  Btw I chose my right arm that time and was mad at myself for not doing laundry or putting the dishes away beforehand.
 
I guess I had Covid for an hour? 
1am crazy shivering, can't get warm in scalding hot shower plus I was really clumsy, then I went to bed

4am woke up struggling to breathe
Itchy, hot skin with rash
Probable fever
Stuffy nose
Wheezing gagging cough (felt like when you inhale pollen)
Slight sore throat
And a weird ass mind fog

It lasted only an hour! 
I laid back down so I could wake up early an find a rapid test so I could see if it was a breakthrough, but I woke up 5 hours later like nothing had happened, except my skin was sensitive all day. 

All in all, in retrospect, very worth it, and it gave me a chance to experience it without really getting it because I was just a little curious.",n9ur4m,2021-05-12 15:24:31
YNA! The day after my shot i had bouts of nausea. I wasn’t expecting that because it’s not a common symptom. But it went away the next day.,na0kw3,2021-05-11 18:18:50
I also had some nausea after my second shot (which was yesterday). Laid down cause I felt kinda sick woke up a few hours later and felt fine. The pharmacist who gave me the second shot said to consult a doctor if I had any symptoms lasting over 24 hours though so if you continue to feel nauseous you might want to call your gp.,na0kw3,2021-05-11 19:18:50

"Obviously not a doctor, but my advise is to drink lots of water and take some Tylenol. Body aches are normal. The clots associated with J&J are extremely rare, and you don’t have to worry because the moderna shots are different science.

And tell yourself you’ve already gotten this exact same shot before. Any reactions you’re having is your body’s immune system getting ready to fight Covid if you ever encounter it.",nadgr4,2021-05-12 02:53:43

"\- How long after you were able to get vaccinated did you get an appointment? For me it was around 2 weeks to secure one in Chicago.  
  
\- How did you stay positive during the waiting period? I'm having a tough time with this..: I didn't really care about the waiting period, it's nice knowing that even after the first shot you're at something like 70% efficacy against hospitalization.  
  
\- Did you care if you got Moderna, Pfizer or J&J or any of the others? At the time I did not care at all, the J&J news dropped literally the day after I got my 1st shot of Moderna and the Pfizer reports came out a few weeks later. So I guess I feel like I ""lucked"" into Moderna not having any major issues reported yet.",na3o1j,2021-05-11 21:55:24

In Boston it opened to the public on April 19th. I was able to get an appointment for May 6th so two and a half weeks.

Currently the mainstream statement is to be careful if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant, because we're not sure if the vaccine can be transferred to a fetus through ""vaccinated sperm"" or through the pregnant mother's body.

Haven’t heard of such a delayed reaction. Is it possible something else could have caused it? Usually the allergic reactions I’ve heard of were within a few minutes.,n9lqzh,2021-05-11 03:05:38
"This happened to me after the first dose, in the same time frame too. I took Benadryl and put a little cortisone cream on my lip. The pain stopped shortly after and the swelling went down overnight. I read that this can happen if you had dental work done recently before the vaccine? I'd had a ton of dental work in the weeks prior.",n9lqzh,2021-05-12 20:22:09
"The itchiness isnt 'that' surprising to me. I am allergic to adhesive tape / glue and I do get irritation and hives from band aids, which they did put on me after my 2nd dose earlier this afternoon - obviously I removed the bandaid almost immediately.. but that doesnt prevent my body from reacting.  The swelling and hives occurring hours later though? That does concern me..my lips are slowly coming back to normal and the hives / itchiness are slowly going away thanks to the benadryl. Just curious if anyone else has experienced this.",n9lqzh,2021-05-11 02:46:46
"Nah. Funny story though.... last summer I was kayaking with my husband and there was a wasp in my kayak.  My husband smashed it after being very unsuccessful in throwing it out of my kayak... 

Long story short - I stupidly picked the now' very dead wasp out of my kayak and threw it into the water. I thought nothing of it all all since it never stung me. 

When we got back from our 2 hour kayak run, the first thing I did was light up a cigarette. Within not even 2 minutes I knew what was happening.  My husband looked over and asked if my lip was swollen. I kinda licked the top half and couldnt feel anything at all. I realized far too late that touching that wasp and throwing it overboard and THEN lighting up a cigarette a few hours later was a horrible mistake. 

It started with the lips, then hives and my eyes were stupidly swollen.  I told my husband I could still breathe which was a good sign. I used my inhaler and my epi pen while my husband went to the store 1/2 mile away to grab me some benadryl. I slept for most of the day afterwards.  

You're right though.  Besides peanuts which I'm absolutely highly allergic to - normal medical reactions typically happen within minutes for me, not hours.  

And no - i have never had anaphylactic reactions before except for when I have come into a contact with a wasp (or several lol) or when I had accidentally eaten peanuts (dont eat at cheesecake factory if you are allergic!)

Sorry - in addition- I hadn't eaten anything at all since 11:00am - ish since this morning. So no - certainly not something I ate, drank or touched.

*autocorrect and my fat fingers corrections made lol*",n9lqzh,2021-05-11 03:40:03

"3 weeks as well, same issues, except I had a seizure a few days ago. High doses of prednisone seem to provide temporary relief.  Toroidal injections a few hours. 

I've got increased muscle wasting, from a medical standpoint but nothing else concrete as to an aha. 

Nothing concrete, you'll find a range of Dr's from dismissive and pushing how great the vaccine is,  and others that have seem similar problems.  The last Dr seemed to feel bad and said she had a few people that took 1.5 months before they were recovered. 

When I asked her about the second,  she just told me it's up to my comfort level.. which at this point my life is practically destroyed, so I'm not planning on it.",n98rxa,2021-05-10 17:13:56
"I have mainly arm/hand issues after both Moderna shots. I am currently 1.5 weeks after shot 2 and experiencing cramping, aching and tingling in both arms/hands. I finally went to a doctor and she said she is seeing inflammation issues after Moderna. She is prescribing steroids. My advice to you would be to try some steroids. If they help, you can delay shot two until you are back to normal for a few weeks. If you decide to get shot two and experience the same issues, get back on the steroids.",n98rxa,2021-05-10 20:29:04
"Could you delay the shot for a while? My dr said that would be ok. There isn’t a penalty for delaying beyond  a certain time frame as in they’d ask you to get a 3rd shot. You could try antihistamines, antiinflammatories, turmeric and vit D. I think NAC helps too. My dr said symptoms could be 6-10 weeks and for next shot which I’m definitely delaying if I get it at all (I want to overseas travel though) to premedicate with Motrin, the strongest antihistamine I can handle and she’ll give me steroids to keep on hand. Said prednisone worked to control reactions other patients had. My symptoms started improving after 3/4 weeks. They still come and go but not as bad as before.",n98rxa,2021-05-11 02:43:21
"I had a similar experience with Moderna. First shot I was sick for 3 weeks after. Mainly nausea, dizziness and exhaustion. Just felt terrible. Then at 3 weeks I woke up one day and was back to normal. Had similar reaction to the second but it only lasted 2 weeks. I’m also healthy with no underlying health issues.

I’m also a runner and every time I run my muscles hurt, heart races, chest pain, and I have a hard time catching my breath. I’m in so much pain. There is no amount of money you can pay me for the second dose. This is wild and not normal. I still feel pressured from work and school for the second dose but this is ruining my life and my health. No thanks.",n98rxa,2021-05-11 16:44:49

I'm hoping this will be me also.

"If it’s any consolation, I almost fainted after my first dose too. I don’t have any digestive related issues, but I do get anxiety that can exacerbate a lot of things. In my case, I’m positive it was vasovagal syncope (fainted) onset by psychogenic shock (nervousness of getting the vaccine and sensory overload). If you feel like that’s again, lying down, squeezing your leg muscles, and using an isometric counter pressure exercise like clasping your hands together and pulling away at the same time, can greatly reduce the feeling of fainting/lightheartedness.

In fact better than fine, that way you feel when you've had a bad cold and symptoms for ages and then one day you wake up and feel healthy again.

For example I recently saw someone ask whether the vaccines would be good for a year.  Which raises the question, are there that many people who have had the vaccine for a year?

I stopped breathing in my sleep. I woke up struggling to catch my breath. I had a fever of 103 degrees that wouldn’t go down for almost half a day. For a half an hour at one point I struggled to get my pulse to go below 130 and my O2 above 90. I’m thinking the stress from waking up not breathing might have caused my hair to fall out like it is. The doctors think it was my immune system’s faulty reaction to the vaccine that causes such an adverse reaction. (I have a history of autoimmune problems.) There is a condition called telogen effluvium where under extreme stress your body sends a large number of hair follicles into the resting phase at once. I think that’s what’s going on. If you had a lot of anxiety about your vaccine reaction it could be what’s happening to you too.,n9dht9,2021-05-28 02:36:52

"I'm just keeping an open mind here. I'm not from the US so I don't really care for much of the politicized garbage you guys are being fed. How and why America politicized this virus, I don't know and rather not care why. However, the virus is a global thing and I much rather not hear about some country's internal politics regarding the virus because it's just a bunch of horseshit. Honestly and just from my point of view, the billionaires and influential/powerful people you should be worried about are the ones you don't hear about and run nefarious stuff in the background. People are skeptical about everything, especially since everything has been locked down and I'm a firm believer that 90% of anything is crap. I do believe there are legitimate conspiracy theories but they are VERY rare and often quite well hidden. Not as public and in your face as people make every thing to be.

There will always be vaccine hesitancy, be it the spanish flu or the regular flu shot and people will always come up with reasons not to get it. Understandably so since there have been hiccups in the past when the testing and quality control processes were not as streamlined and well researched. But I think at this point where tens of millions of people have taken these vaccines and it's been quite a number of months, quite logical to say that it's safe. Granted, I wouldn't have wanted to be in the first trials.

However, I'm not a very skeptical person. I like to hear both sides of the argument but at the same time I know that there are people much smarter than me that have studied viruses for many years and a two minute random article won't be a deciding factor for me. I'd much rather talk with my peers that are in the healthcare system to see what they think and people who have caught it firsthand. The only people I trust are the doctors and virologists that have proven the safety, whereas some people believe what politicians, actors and soccer moms that read a 2 minute facebook post and regurgitating falsehoods. The leading anti-vaxxer in my country is a dude with neck tattoos that doesn't look like he has read a book his entire life with his wife having lip injections and the fakest tits you could imagine. I'm not usually one to judge a book by its cover but you can imagine how .

I like to weigh my probability to begin with. Being young, the mortality rate is quite small, however the side effects long term do not sound good. Having a busted lung, blood clots, stroke and smell/taste going away for numerous months would not be pleasant especially being asthmatic. Plus I don't really want to be the cause of suffering to other people who are vulnerable that are close to me. Weighing the probabilities, it was quite logical to me to get the vaccine. We take risks every day in our lives, be it crossing the road or flying on an airplane. The big thing we have to manage is risk management. A lot of people are scared of flying, when they should be scared of the trip going to the airport more. 

I don't quite get the logical reasoning for conspiracy theories against MRNA vaccines because they're as much unproven as the side effects of COVID long term and as it stands it looks like COVID is quite damaging versus no considerable reporting of MRNA side effects long term. The 5G conspiracy thing is just utter garbage that it's not even worth to put a single candle of thought into it.

Anyways, I've taken the Moderna vaccine after some thought and honestly I feel amazing. There was a few hours where I had arm pain from a local antibody response, but after that it was gone no side effects since then. It's been two months since I got it and honestly I feel much better than being cooped up inside. I used to be anxious going out but now I just mask up indoors to be considerate.

Just a random writeup in the middle of the night.",n9qgj2,2021-05-11 09:48:24
"The problem with this whole post is that the vaccines discussed, cannot be independently evaluated. That is a red flag for many, including me, because anything claimed originates from the manufacturer. Other than that, you either believe it or you don't. And that's not science. Another red flag is the whole process of vaccination. There is no interest on immunity, rather ""vaccine certificates"" and ""vaccine passports"". And yet another red flag is the mandate. Critical elements of life need no mandate, they just work for the user.

Also conspiracy points mentioned, exist precisely because there is no transparency (since 1906 this market is monopolized). When something is transparent ambiguity or doubt vanishes.

Anyways I don't want to write lengthy posts in this sub, so I will address just couple points.

>I don't understand why that would be the case because if that were true, the body would already be attacking its own organs. 

One of the things I found is this:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786493/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786493/)

Basically the article talks about stem cells being resilient to natural infection. That means stem cells cannot get infected naturally and that makes sense looking from an evolution standpoint (that is verifiable independently). But when you inject particles into the muscle or bloodstream that is not a natural infection, rather molecules that now circulate. You can't tell what cells and where and how, will be affected.

>Have also heard that the spike protein already exists in the body, and if you get the vacc, your body will start to attack its own organs (conspiracy theory)

"I didn’t get the vaccine. I contracted covid this month. I’m fine. Yes, if I had a job I might be forced to attend while sick. If I lived in a nursing home I might die, or cause others to. Both of those scenarios exist only to perpetuate the idea that the virus is novel and that the ifr is significant. They pumped up the numbers. PCR padded the numbers. Ventilating everyone last Spring-Winter padded the death statistics. Yet I’m the conspiracy theorist because I know that medical kidnap and idiopathic disease are nothing new. This is no conspiracy. It’s true.",n9qgj2,2021-05-11 11:25:07
"I'm gonna try and answer some of your questions as factually as possible, but feel free to ask more questions about what matters most to you. This has personal importance to me because I used to dabble in conspiracy theories and alternative medicine, but gradually changed my mind as I dug through fact-heavy sources.

It sounds like Bill Gates's talk around controlling population growth is a major issue. Even if he wanted to somehow make the vaccines unsafe, could he? A quick search reveals that his foundation has given [a lot of money](https://observer.com/2020/12/how-bill-gates-helped-make-the-covid-19-vaccine-possible/) for vaccines--[over a billion](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-announces-250-million-covid/story?id=74651890). But he could be giving this money for good or evil reasons, so we need to look at other evidence. The other parties funding the vaccine development would have a strong incentive to not get involved in a genocidal plot. After all, the great majority of people aren't interested in mass murder. In the end, it it really necessary to consider Gates's intentions? Do you have any evidence there's something bad in the vaccine? Do you have verifiable knowledge of a similar situation, where someone intentionally poisoned medicine on the scale of millions?

What about politicians who don't wear masks? Nobody really likes masks, but politicians can get away with it a bit because they're leaders. Also, ditching a mask won't endanger your health if you're vaccinated because the mRNA vaccines are super effective--the [CDC claims](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html) 94.1% for Moderna, a claim [repeated](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e1.htm?s_cid=mm695152e1_w) by a panel of experts who [aren't allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Committee_on_Immunization_Practices) to have a financial interest in vaccines. This was based on a study of \~30k people. And [all three vaccines](https://reason.com/2021/02/23/vaccines-are-100-effective-at-preventing-covid-19-hospitalizations-and-deaths/) under EUA are even better at preventing hospitalization/death.

You might think they fudged the numbers, but all three vaccines have cleared the FDA, the CDC, and an independent committee within the FDA with [very stringent conflict of interest rules](https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/20/dry-technical-but-important-why-an-fda-advisory-panels-meeting-on-covid-19-vaccines-matters/). These people, with no financial incentive to take companies' study data at face value, independently reviewed all the safety/efficacy data and found no major issues. Ex.: [Proof they voted in favor of Moderna](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-12-18-fda-panel-recommends-eua-modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate). Gov't, industry, and independent scientists are all carefully looking at vaccine safety data but there's no evidence anything untoward is going on. You're skeptical but so are scientists. That's why they demand every claim be backed up by facts.

Your claim that the coronavirus spike protein already exists in the body, or that the spike itself is harmful, is an interesting claim. Look at [this Science Based Medicine article](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/spike-proteins-covid-19-and-vaccines/). I love SBM as a source because the articles are written by doctors and claims are dissected very thoroughly with ample evidence behind them. There's a shred of truth in this--the spike protein is harmful in the bloodstream, but the vaccines deliver the mRNA into muscle, and in limited amounts. The Moderna vaccine only produces part of the spike, and the Pfizer produces the whole thing, but they're both safe, showing that it isn't an issue at the dosage and location from vaccines.

TL;DR: There's no reliable information that the vaccines are dangerous or ineffective. While conspiracy sites try to stir up doubts that sound potentially medically plausible, real scientists have direct observations (in the form of trials and vaccine safety monitoring data) that the vaccines are very safe.

If you have any more doubts, feel free to pose more questions.",n9qgj2,2021-05-12 21:32:29
"Okay, I've been typing for a while, but a couple more quick notes. First, the whole ""the vaccine doesn't reduce transmission"" thing. When the vaccines were first approved, they absolutely warned people the vaccines may not reduce transmission because it wasn't studied. But now we have real-world data showing that vaccinated people are much less likely to transmit the virus.

The other one--how long will the vaccine last? Nobody knows because the scientific process depends on observation, and we obviously don't have observations on the vaccine's long-term effectiveness. But it's probably gonna be at least a year, as that's how long the flu shot lasts, and the coronavirus mutates a lot slower than the flu in part because it ""proofreads"" its RNA when it replicates.",n9qgj2,2021-05-12 22:39:16

That is a red flag for many, including me, because anything claimed originates from the manufacturer. Other than that, you either believe it or you don't. And that's not science. Another red flag is the whole process of vaccination.

Agreed with all points, the lack of transparency is exactly why I'm hesitant.

After posting this topic I read more articles from official mainstream sources, and also some alternative sources. It seems to be that the mainstream is totally for vaccination, and the alternatives are against it, for various reasons, some more likely than others.

I read some articles on more conspiracy theory sites. According to them, Covid can't be isolated, so it hasn't been proven to exist. Also the PCR test is sensitive to both Covid and flu A and flu B... so it could be that positive Covid results are simply positive flu results. That aligns with CDC's own reporting of very very few flu cases in 2020.

That still doesn't explain the more severe effects of Covid such as lung scarring, but I'm a bit more hesitant to take the shot if Covid can't even be isolated in a lab. However those claims weren't cited, so I'd have to check to see if anyone has isolated it. They also mentioned a study done in Germany on... I forgot the disease, but it was a disease supposedly known to be transmitted via air. And it was a disease easily treatable. And they got a bunch of sick people to cough a lot on healthy people in a lab, and none of the healthy people got sick.

So after I've read articles from mainstream and conspiracy theory sources, I'm left with this conclusion: I can't really know the answers. My opinion is mostly affected by which sources I read from, which is frightening. If I read more mainstream, I feel better about it. If I read more conspiracy theory, I feel worse about it.

The latest unsolvable problem that I found was, since the mRNA is coated with PEG to make it last a while in the body (so it doesn't degrade before it enters the cells), it's possible that it would last a long time and continue producing spike proteins, which are currently thought to be inflammatory and therefore harmful. The fact that they're covered in PEG is from mainstream news. The idea that the covering could cause them to take a long time to break down is from conspiracy.

Exactly why are there any deaths from the vaccines? That's something that isn't disputed, but the numbers are very low, something like 4000 / 245 million, at least according to a conspiracy site. My current feeling is that the deaths occur in people who have underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, and for whatever reason, that pre-existing condition causes them to be unable to fight the inflammatory response to the vaccine. I guess blood clots are made due to the inflammation too.

Add in the fact that Fauci and Brix admitted to overcounting Covid deaths, and various other verifiable facts, and I'm a fence-sitter again. I don't know where to go from here.

One thing I really want to know. Why were nurses dancing on TikTok so much in the early days of the outbreak? Weren't they super busy and swamped with patients? The options here are: A) they were dancing to lift up their own spirits because they were depressed due to overwork and many patient deaths, or B) they were told to keep their mouths shut and the reality was that there weren't as many Covid patients as we were led to believe.

I'm inclined to believe A. If B were true, people would be hearing the rumor by now, because nurses don't keep secrets.",n9qgj2,2021-05-11 11:38:27
"I hate having to read for hours and hours just to feel secure in my opinion about something, especially if I'm not interested in it otherwise.

If PCR can't distinguish between Covid and flu, who's to say it exists? But then, how do I explain lung scarring if not Covid?

>  medical kidnap and idiopathic disease 

I'd like more on this, even just a link or two would be fine. Currently hearing a lot of bad slander against hospitals and healthcare people, saying they're in on it all. I realize there are a lot of people in politics and other sectors that don't want the best for the commoners, but healthcare too? There are so many more people in healthcare, I don't think they would all be in on it.

Heard a story on a conspiracy channel about 911 wouldn't let them take a family member to the hospital, because Covid might spread, so they have to go in an ambulance instead. And the host said ""that's because they don't want the family members around when the person is killed in the hospital."" And it sounded like the hospitals are death camps. Which isn't true at all. I know there are many pathogens in hospitals and it's a great place to go if you want to catch some disease. But intentionally killing people? Come on now.....",n9qgj2,2021-05-11 11:48:59
"I just wanted to expand on the spike protein in the blood. It's likely true that it's pretty harmful. The person who I take all my queues from and have been following for a while, Dr. john Campbell, has raised exactly this same question. He mentions that it's no longer the practice for someone adminestering a intramuscular medicine to pull back on the plunger to make sure they aren't in a vein or blood vessell. He thinks it's possible that the blood clots from the JnJ could be caused by this. Of course, it's just a guess, but it does follow a good line of logic as to why it's so rare but is occuring. I think we need to be spreading this information, just in case. It can't hurt.",n9qgj2,2021-05-13 00:45:26

to what,n9qgj2,2021-05-11 11:20:16
"I think I can actually address most of these claims head-on. Let's start with the idea that the virus has never been isolated, which as you note, is claimed on conspiracy sites without a citation. That's dead wrong. It has been, many times, all over the world, as described (with cited sources!) by both [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-isolated-virus/) and [Health Feedback](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/the-virus-that-causes-covid-19-exists-and-was-identified-and-isolated-multiple-times-by-independent-research-groups/). We've sequenced the virus' RNA countless times, allowing us to track its evolution over the course of a year. Ex. [this article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32092483/) where just one researcher looks at the slight differences among 86 different genomes; I'm sure you can find more in-depth stuff but I found that article first.

Although the COVID-19 tests aren't perfect, it's dead wrong they can't differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and the flu. The chemicals used in the test are designed to bind with a very specific strand of RNA that's only found in the SARS-CoV, not the flu, and not even other coronaviruses. Here's a scientific article that discusses [accuracy of different types of tests](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2020/09/30/bmjebm-2020-111511). This is the kind of material that informs the consensus of doctors, and the consensus is that the tests are accurate. While it's hard to measure the false-positive rate of the tests, we don't believe it's high because the chemicals that bind to the virus's RNA are specific and people aren't randomly testing positive all the time.

The whole think about the RNA being coated in PEG is an interesting idea, but again, it's not like the thousands of people involved in the vaccine development process didn't think about this either, and every shred of evidence we have points to the vaccines being safe. You can look up the data from the trials yourself if you want. The proof i sin the pudding. Even with the J&J blood clots--safe means the risk is negligible, not zero, and the mRNA shots have no such issue.

>Exactly why are there any deaths from the vaccines? That's something that isn't disputed, but the numbers are very low, something like 4000 / 245 million, at least according to a conspiracy site.

No, not even 4000 people have died from the vaccines. That number probably comes from VAERS. [That claim was taken out of context.](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaers-deaths-idUSL1N2LV0NY)  I've looked up vaccine safety in VAERS myself. The purpose of VAERS is to be a ""[hypothesis-generating mechanism](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/06/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlsons-misleading-claim-about-deaths-afte/)"" by recording anything that happens after a shot, whether or not it's from the shot. Literally anyone can file a report in VAERS. You don't need to be a doctor, reports aren't checked for medical plausibility, and reports aren't even checked for fabricated claims. The scientific consensus is that the numbers aren't concerning. VAERS is a reliable source if you're a scientist looking to investigate a specific side effect in greater depth, but it's absolutely useless for proving a certain number of people experienced a certain event because of the vaccine.

As for the number of COVID-19 deaths, maybe [look at this](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-flawed-study-fuels-erroneous-claims-about-covid-19-death-toll/)? I've been typing for a while.

And the dancing nurses on TikTok are explainable I think. First of all, it's anecdotal so I don't see it as a strong indication of nurses' workload either way. We'd need more data to ascertain that. It's possible that nurses were dancing as a way of dealing with burnout, but there's another possibility. When the pandemic first started, many places stopped doing non-urgent medical care like cancer tests. While hospital nurses may have been overworked, others were paradoxically [underworked](https://www.newsy.com/stories/despite-pandemic-doctors-and-nurses-facing-furloughs-and-unemployment/)\--furloughed or even laid off. Also, the hospitals in many areas never got overwhelmed in March and April. It happened in hotspots like NYC and Italy, but many ares of the US had crowded, but not overwhelmed, hospitals, according to the official data.",n9qgj2,2021-05-12 22:30:33
"I didn't know that they pulled back on the plunger sometimes. I know injecting air can be disastrous. Would injecting air bubbles cause blood clots? Blood clots don't necessarily cause death, but they're my main concern at the moment. I'll be back later to type more...",n9qgj2,2021-05-13 01:06:41
"They want us all dead... they don't give a fuck if you're a Dem or a Rep, they want this world to themselves and they can't wait until we're all gone.",n9qgj2,2021-05-11 11:30:15
"It will kill you but I don't think it has anything to do with clotting. It's when the air bubble gets into the heart through veins that it's a problem i think. Not a doctor though so I could be wrong. But yes if it's already inside your arm and they pull back they most likely wont be pulling in air as there isn't typically air inside your muscles. It used to be a common practice accoring do Dr. Campbell but they aren't teaching it to these people giving the injections.

"You're welcome! I'm definitely not saying it doesn't suck though. I actually had it very similar to your picture in day 16 after vaccine 1 of Moderna. The next one I got it earlier and worse. It was basically elbow to shoulder, rock hard, hot, intensely itchy deep in my arm, and very painful. I made too many jokes about wanting to cut it off.  

I read some studies about it though and most people who get it with shot one don't get it with shot two. I just got lucky I guess. Since my reaction to the first one was so delayed, I did have them switch arms...which honestly sucked because I had this whole plan of not doing it in my dominant arm, also the side I sleep on. 

Anyway, I managed with Tylenol and Benadryl. Due to other medical problems, I do have a prescription for pain medication that I did take on occasion because of the body pain. I also bought Benadryl cream. Oral Benadryl was better for the swelling, and obviously sleeping. But the cream was better for the itching. You cannot use both at the same time. So mostly I'd use the cream during the day and then the oral medication at night.

Arm pain lingered for almost a week after the first shot, but was less severe and gone after two days for the second.",n938aw,2021-05-10 14:45:39

My first shot sucked bad for awhile. Got my second on Friday and so far no issues. Get your shot. The benefits far outweigh the risks.,n8opwm,2021-05-10 00:58:38
"Just remember that extreme reactions are rare and prepare yourself by drinking tons of water, Gatorade, and pedialyte, starting a day in advance and continue to hydrate immediately after you get the shot. Everytime I started to get a headache I’d chug water and it would go away. I do think it helped me avoid a worse reaction. I also bought some ginger ale in case of nausea and kept Tylenol and Advil on hand. For me, being prepared helped ease my anxiety.",n8opwm,2021-05-10 00:59:50

I would prepare to have the next day off and in bed, it's very common to feel flu-ish the day after 2nd dose so have some easy meals ready and lots of fluids on hand.",n8opwm,2021-05-10 02:04:17
"My husband (31m) is a hypochondriac too. In the days before his second shot, he would just cry and shake, and I had to comfort him and explain a million times how mRNA works, explain how the side effects work, and bring up a person on my Twitter who was part of the human trial for Pfizer.

I went with him to get second shot. The next day he had a little fever, body aches, fatigue and a really bad headache. He was fine by the next day, and has had no issues since.

Even if your side effects are a bit on the severe side, you will be ok. It’s just your immune system working. It does not mean you are dying. You’re not actually sick... your body just thinks it is!

Also, I just got my second dose of moderna (34f) on Thursday. All I had was backache, body ache, fever and fatigue. I’m feeling better already!",n8opwm,2021-05-10 03:22:02
"Got my second dose of Moderna on Saturday and I’m still alive. I do have severe allergies to many things and I carry an epi pen, but I made it!! I was sluggish and sweaty the day after my injection, but today I just have a sore arm. Good luck!",n8opwm,2021-05-10 18:08:16
"My brother is a huge hypochondriac — had very minor side effect (sore arm at injection site) after both first and second Moderna shots.

I am NOT a hypochondriac — had intense muscle and joint aches for one day after second vaccine.  Now my brother is stressed out that he didn’t have stronger side effects.  So hypochondriacs gonna hypochondriac.

Line up a vaccine buddy to go with you if you can.  My friend was nervous to go so I booked our appointments for both shots for the same day and time.  Then I checked in with him at regular intervals.  You can compare notes and sharing the experience will help allay anxiety because you will both be looking out for each other.",n8opwm,2021-05-10 20:10:46
"Hey, I was also really scared for my second shot, so scared that i was close to not even going to my second appointment!! I also looked into these death stories (the Utah case specifically scared the crap out of me!) but I looked into doctors on YouTube discussing the cases and cause of death in detail and it made me feel a bit better.


I also made the mistake of looking at Death entries on VAERS...just remember a lot of the “deaths” on here are unverified, anyone can make a bogus report!! And some of the entries look really fake. 


As for the second shot...I’m not gonna lie, I had REALLY severe symptoms, but they didn’t last more than 1 night. Got the vaccine on Saturday; and by Sunday noon I was feeling 100% again. :) so even if you start feeling bad, DO NOT PANIC! It is normal!",n8opwm,2021-05-10 21:02:13
"So a day before getting my second dose I saw a video on tik tok about someone dying after second dose. I have really bad anxiety and a huge fear of dying, so that triggered me. The day of my anxiety was extremely bad, the nurse had to wait at least 5 minutes cuz I just couldn’t do it. She finally did and my anxiety got even worse. I think I had anxiety for a week thinking I would die or something really bad was going to happen. It’s been 2-3 weeks now and I have been completely fine.

After my second dose, I was worried I'd be faint and worse off than the first but I was actually totally fine!! I had a fever and was super tired the next day but by day 2 I was all good to go! I will say the only thing I've noticed is my period is 10 days late. I also had moderna shot.",n8opwm,2021-05-10 19:20:10
"You'll be fine. You have a much higher chance of dying from covid than the vaccine. The side effects are way overblown. I got sick, but I recovered pretty fast. Don't worry.",n8opwm,2021-05-10 20:36:45
"I had the same anxiety as you did and I was fine. I also had a really bad reaction to the first vaccine and almost didn’t got get the second one because of it. I had zero side effects from the second shot, other than a sore arm. You will be okay!",n8opwm,2021-05-10 21:18:43
"I had the same fears as you! I have EDS, asthma, severe allergies, PCOS, etc... I had a normal shitty reaction which was a 100 degree fever for about 30-36 hours, chills and headache.. And then it was over!! Super easy and safe :)",n8opwm,2021-05-10 22:59:00
Idk if its true but I feel ppl that get a bad reaction probably would have been goners without the shot.  I broke out with some rashes/hives like 10 days after my first shot. I just think any side effect is worth the risk. Just focus on getting better with diet and hydration.,n8opwm,2021-05-11 17:44:21

"You’re welcome! 

It’s normal to be a little scared. Even me, someone obsessed with researching and learning about these vaccines... I knew a lot about how the vaccines worked and their backstories... and when I went to get my shots I even got a little nervous and I was like ohhh this is how my hubby felt. I get it. 

Prep by getting a lot of water, Gatorade and Tylenol. Be prepared to watch a lot of Netflix!",n8opwm,2021-05-10 05:51:02

It subsided next day but was still exhausted. Husbands wasn’t as bad but his side effects happened next day but not as severe. It’s nuts how it affects people differently and severity of those effects.",n8pjzd,2021-05-10 04:35:25
"Just got mine today. About 3-4 hours after injection my arm started hurting a fair bit more than with other vaccines I've had. My arm looked fine, no redness or swelling, but half my hand went numb for about an hour. It was like what you would experience if you pinched your ulnar nerved; pinky and ring finger were affected. Applied a cold compress to the injection site and that seemed to help.

I'll be curious to see how I feel overnight and into the morning.",n8pjzd,2021-05-10 05:34:06

"Hi! I’m sorry you’re not feeling well after your shots. 
I just got my first dose of Moderna 2 hours ago and don’t feel any particular symptom yet. 
But my boyfriend has been hesitant about getting the shot at all because he’s got a long history of ulcerative colitis with colonoscopies every 2 years and has been on daily medication for decades. 
I don’t think there’s sufficient data out there to know how the vaccine affects these inflammatory diseases. 

I appreciate you sharing your experience and please keep us posted on your symptoms. 
I hope you feel better and back to normal soon!",n8ljlh,2021-05-09 23:12:42
So tough.. I know exactly how this feels. I've had 6 er visits.  I was also in the middle of a relapse when I got shot 2.  I had a lot riding on the vaccine fixing my longhaulers symptoms. Luckily I came out of that relapse and have been mostly okay until about 5 days ago. It's such a crazy fucking virus. Honestly I think there is an autoimmune component. Maybe our bodies produce autoantibodies when we see this spikey boi.  I just don't understand why they haven't figured this out.  Don't doctors want to know? Are they waiting for guidance from the CDC? Not sure wtf is going on. Stay strong.. some people do recover 100% so we have to maintain hope.,n8ljlh,2021-05-10 04:11:32
"I got covid at 37.. I was a little overweight at the time but pretty healthy.  It sucks because I always gain weight in the winter and lose it when I have to do yardwork in the spring. I got sick in mid March right before I usually start to get back in shape. I never get sick and it has been the worst and most terrifying experience of my life. Not knowing what is next sucks and being jacked up for 14 months is horrible. I would get the shot again. I urge everyone to get the vaccine. The inflammation is likely temporary and will eventually go away.. I hope... but I had inflammation before the vaccine. The vaccine may have amplified it, but I just don't have real proof. Covid is hell. I can't believe I caught that shit. Good luck and thank you for your kind reply.",n8ljlh,2021-05-10 03:13:10

"Just got my first shot today. My arm certainly hurts more than other vaccines I've had. Going to keep an eye out for shoulder pain. One thing I did get was that half my hand went numb for an hour, happened about 3-4hrs after injection once the ""hit with a brick"" pain started kicking in. Cold compress on injection site helped with pain and numbness. I'm guessing swelling started to put pressure on a nerve.",n8mgci,2021-05-10 05:41:06
"Currently experiencing this starting on day three after my second shot. I had a similar issue a couple years back with a flu vaccine in the other arm. Got the flu vaccine in November 2019, quickly developed the deep shoulder pain, and had it for so long that I eventually saw my doctor about it in February 2020. She figured I injured it while working out, but I'd been avoiding shoulder exercises since November because of the pain. It did eventually go away by early summer, but it was very strange.

I didn't have anything like this with the first Moderna shot, and I'm hoping this won't stick around as long and I hope yours clears up as well!",n8mgci,2021-05-10 12:34:31
My hubby has been complaining of this. We are due to get the second shot Tuesday and he will still get the random shoulder pains. For what its worth he was relatively okay side effect wise. I had a horrible time after the first shot and have no lasting side effects that ive noticed.,n8mgci,2021-05-10 02:58:43
"Same here, my first shot was 4/15 and my shoulder/arm still hurts. There good days and there are days that I feel like I juts got the vaccine. I’m due for second dose tomorrow and I’m still not sure if I’ll get it. I’m afraid to have the same reaction in my right arm. Hope you feel better soon!",n8mgci,2021-05-13 17:23:48
"I had both shots in my non dominant arm. I would advise that. I have a lingering pain in my shoulder...not at the injection spot, and deep in my  shoulder that I've never had before. It's not like the arthritis or the wear and tare from carrying electrical pipe for years. It's new and like it's not constant, but out of the blue it will hurt deep and limit my range. I would hate to have this in both shoulders.",n8mgci,2021-05-13 18:30:38
They're definitely learning this part as they go. Don't be surprised if boosters are needed periodically.,n8k0ng,2021-05-09 19:43:17
"They know for a fact that immunity lasts at least 6 months, after second those but it’s only been around for that long. They expect it to last much longer. New boosters will be added to address new variants (South Africa, Brazil) that the current vaccines don’t work as well on. The dominant strain in the US is the Uk variant which is very contagious and vaccine offers strong protection against it.",n8k0ng,2021-05-09 20:40:25
I can tell you this is one vaccine I really hope I dont need boosters for.,n8k0ng,2021-05-09 23:15:02
I think this is yet to be determined. I know that Pfizer and Moderna both spoke about the possibility of boosters 6-9 months after the second dose.,n8k0ng,2021-05-09 19:23:09
Hopefully it’s a once a year thing like the flu shot but they don’t know yet. I read that 6 months after both shots you still have 90% protection,n8k0ng,2021-05-09 20:40:00

I mean as far as that article says they are the same. But I def felt the 2nd one waaaaay more then the 1st one (mine were a month apart). The person who gave it to me said the 2nd one was thicker and that's why it hurt so much. And I couldn't lift my arm after a couple hours where the 1st one just felt like  a bruise after. They seemed like a different concentrate to me.,n8i60h,2021-05-10 04:17:00

Just felt weird. Soreness went away in a day or two but twitches remained. My GP doctor said it would go away on it's own but it definitely hasn't and now I think it's causing raynaud's syndrome since my feet and fingers lose feeling, go numb, fall asleep and/or are discolored off and on throughout the day.

"Oh man, are you going to push for a neuro consult?  I've had so many things I haven't even listed them all.  What put me over the edge was that I stuttered a few times and it's been harder to find words sometimes.  I don't get headaches and I had a few on the left side with blurriness in that eye as well.  I'm 40, this is a mess.  I have a neuro consult referral which unfortunately takes some time.  I haven't had actual numbness, just that tingly and super heavy and limp feeling in my arms.  My calves feel like they're just shy of charlie horsing sometimes, my hands feel exhausted.  My lips have been tingling, but at some point with all of this worry I wonder what is an overlap of psychosomatic as well.

re: feeling psychosomatic, IMO it's not psychosomatic if there are physical symptoms but BFS is also brought on by stress so worrying about it is probably not helping.

"My arm stopped hurting about 3 days after the first shot. About the same for the second. I never got covid arm and it never hurt so badly that I couldn't raise my arm over my head. I chose to get the shot in my left arm both times.

Try stretching and gently moving your arm around. it's possible that your muscles got tense due to the initial pain and need help relaxing. A hot bath might help as well.",n8mger,2021-05-09 23:38:54
"1st took over a week.

2nd was mild, a couple days.",n8mger,2021-05-10 00:57:49
I’m on day 3 and my arm is still hurting. I noticed my armpit was swollen. I googled it and apparently the lymph nodes swell sometimes on the arm you got injected. You can actually see a lump if I hold my arms up.,n8mger,2021-05-10 02:59:03
"Got it on the 1st day, disappeared around 2nd or 3rd day, then it returned on 9th day, this time itchy, then disappeared around 11th day. I only experienced little pain on both occasions, with the second time it showed up being more itchy than painful.

Maybe go see a doctor if the pain still doesn't leave. That's weird.",n8mger,2021-05-10 03:52:24
It’s been a month since my first dose and my arm still hurts! I’m not sure if I’ll get the second dose.,n8mger,2021-05-13 17:37:54
Are you far past the 9th day at this point? It hasn't come back again?,n8mger,2021-05-11 07:47:33

"Everyone warned me the second dose was worse, but I had more symptoms with the first, like you!",n8bjrd,2021-05-09 12:11:07
I received my 2nd does yesterday morning. Aches and a slight chill hit around 9 or 10 pm. Not a great night sleep but I never got fever or shakes. Still very sore now and have a slight headache but i think my consistent drinking of pedialyte helped. Hydration is key.,n8bjrd,2021-05-09 15:41:45
"I got my second dose on Friday as well. It whooped my ass.

101° fever and shakes. Seems to be a little better today but feels like I got hit by a car",n8bjrd,2021-05-09 14:16:30
"Thanks for sharing. I've got my second dose coming up and I'm not too excited about it. I had the same symptoms you had after the first dose including  diarrhea for a full week.

Cheers",n8bjrd,2021-05-10 03:24:34
Same here. First was really rough. So far the second is just kinda bad but lightyears better really.,n8bjrd,2021-05-09 12:30:47
"Just took my second dose 2 days ago and I had no side effects. I highly recommend taking vitamins the day of and I also drank an entire pedialyte after my vaccine. The only thing I felt was MAYBE a little bit fatigue, other than that slight arm pain that was gone by the first day",n8bjrd,2021-05-10 03:42:21
Thanks Alex. Much appreciated friend,n8bjrd,2021-05-10 10:17:41
"Can you define the covid arm? Is it only soreness, redness, anything else?",n8fals,2021-05-09 17:08:09
"First shot was worse and longer-lasting in terms of COVID arm, but still got it the second time too.",n8fals,2021-05-09 19:16:24
I haven't gotten my second vaccine yet but I developed a rash a week after my first. It's been a few days and it keeps growing and the dang thing is giving me anxiety.,n8fals,2021-05-10 18:43:21
"i get my second shot next monday, in 4 days",n8fals,2021-05-13 20:30:29
"The 4 most common indicators of this kind of inflammation are:

Soreness 
Redness
Heat
Swelling 

You can have only one of this symptoms or all 4 above 

In my case I have on swelling and heat 6 inchs around injection site, and that started 8 days after 1st shoot",n8fals,2021-05-09 17:50:51
"I had a strong reaction my shoulder was very swollen and hard as if I had a golf ball in my arm half in and half out, it only lasted 36-48 hours and it completely disappeared,

So even even if it look strong that can quickly disappear",n8fals,2021-05-11 11:27:21
My opinion only. Saying you got covid arm only because you had soreness is a bit misleading. A lot vaccines administered in the arm result in that as well.,n8fals,2021-05-09 21:25:14
My rash faded a day or two ago,n8fals,2021-05-14 21:41:36
"I agree, all vaccines can cause a inflammation depends the vaccine and depends the person, but the Covid arm it’s a stronger reaction more like a wasp sting, I had the DPTC last year I had a little soreness but nothing comparable to this.

By the data we have today this reaction is harmless 

This reaction I describe has over-exuberant of the immune system

Somehow I would like to state a hypothesis than maybe the people who got this reaction have a possible too strong reaction also if they had caught the covid, like the cytokines storm we ear about, so maybe we are the lucky one 😄

 (it’s a hypothesis nothing establishes yet)",n8fals,2021-05-09 22:16:09
"That sounds so interesting!

I'll answer as no covid arm, since it was not any worse to a flu shot :) and FYI, did have covid but had very minor symptoms",n8fals,2021-05-09 22:26:50
"Thanks for this precision, and it’s a very good idea to answer at this question.

To compare the reaction after the vaccine shoot from someone who got the Covid with no or mild symptoms and someone who had the Covid with severe symptoms",n8fals,2021-05-09 22:49:53
"Yes! I had a strong reaction to the first shot, but my second was much less severe. I'm not sure why I had such a ""backwards"" experience as the last time we were sick (my son and I) was in February 2020 before COVID was confirmed in my county.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 00:53:23
Drink lots of Gatorade! It really helps,n7uy0j,2021-05-08 21:52:28
"My first dose of Moderna sounds similar to what you are experiencing. I had the shot on a Thursday morning and felt fine all through out the day. That night the arm pain kicked in. When I woke the next morning I had a bad headache, body aches, congestion, grogginess and so so tired. This lasted until the following Wednesday. So about 5-6 days. I just received my second dose this past Thursday. I had arm pain again and yesterday, Friday I felt
Kind of sore and achy. Today I am fine. I was so nervous about getting the second dose after my experience the first go round. I started taking a vitamin c/elderberry vitamin for immune health and made sure I was well hydrated to prepare. Good luck and I hope you get to feeling better soon.",n7uy0j,2021-05-08 23:35:04
"So I got my shot like 4 days ago, and I have “Covid-arm”— big, red, swollen circle on my arm that was very sore. Thankfully moving it, icing it, and drinking lots of water has reduced it pretty immediately. My husband has had no symptoms yet after his shot. 

That’s my honest review.",n7uy0j,2021-05-08 23:56:59
"On the 4th day after taking my first Pfizer vaccine I broke into hives and was itchy all over my body then eyes, nose, ears, lips, hands, chin and feet started swelling up. I literally couldn’t bend my fingers. I ended up in the ER twice in 2 days. I got epinephrine, ibuprofen, Benadryl, and a million other things but no one had answers. On the 3rd day I had a doctor appointment and the she tells me it sounds like it could’ve been a delayed reaction to the vaccine (which has happened before) or just a severe allergic reaction to something (we don’t know what because nothing had changed from my everyday life except I took my last antibiotic the day of my vaccine) I got blood work done for allergy testing and nothing came back unusual. After being seen by the allergy specialist she tells me she thinks it’s a reaction to the antibiotics and the Covid vaccine being mixed. I got a second allergy test done and everything looks normal. Every doctor I saw told me I was fine to take the second one but to take an allergy pill before hand. I’m traveling for a month and just took my second vaccine a day ago. I’m terrified but so far I don’t have a single side effect, I really do think it was the antibiotic. Has anyone had anything like this from either the vaccine or antibiotic?",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 05:53:42
"Got my second dose on Thursday. Felt fatigued all day and slept most of the day- thought I was gonna get off easy. Then around 9 pm I started feeling fever symptoms. Woke up throughout the night and ended up with a 103.3 fever. I also had quite a bit of back pain which seemed odd. Drank a lot of water and took Tylenol throughout the day. Totally fine today :)

Would definitely get it again- I work in hospitality so I come into contact with tons of people. Definitely worth 1 day of feeling like trash.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 08:46:38
"I agree. I want to know everything to expect because it truly feels like they're hiding something by not telling people 'yeah, it'll suck for  a day or 2 but then you'll have protection'.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 15:02:51
"With my first shot all I had was soreness at the injection site. With my second dose I have the soreness again, in addition to a 3 hour nap on both day 1 and 2. My heart rate was elevated (100-110 BPM just sitting on the couch) the first night, but more-or-less back to normal by the second night. I got my vaccine at 9am.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 05:12:53
I only has a sore arm and chills for like 30 mins at night that’s about it,n7uy0j,2021-05-09 16:13:23
"Gatorade, Ibuprofen, and ice my friend",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 16:47:28
"My first dose I had nothing, not even a sore arm, I go for my second one on the 21st, not sure what to expect with the second one.


Edit: ok I did feel a little weird for a couple of days, I guess people are calling it brain fog. My brain felt a little off, I didn't feel sick and I had no aches or pains, not even in my arm . But the brain thing has me contemplating the second dose.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 18:33:45
"I hydrated really well starting day before and several days after, took Tylenol and Advil as needed after shot, extra vit C, some vit A 3 days before and 2 days after (recommended by NP who is trained in the area of vaccination prep). Might be worth trying with second shot if no contraindications for you for those things.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 19:29:45
"Got my second shot and after the drive home I noticed my arm was sore. I went to work the day after feeling a little off but nothing major. Gave it an hour and I had a 102 fever, super achy, massive headache and sensitive to everything. I ended up leaving early since it was slow and slept it off. Felt a little stiff the second day and tired but I’m back to normal now. Only thing slightly different is less of an appetite.",n7uy0j,2021-05-10 00:08:22
"I'm on day 6 of my second moderna shot and I'm perfectly fine, both shots I had about 3 days of arm soreness and fatigue but then I return to normal. It sucks its not just that easy for everyone but that really shows how everyone's immune system is different and why certain people are more at risk for covid. If you get the vaccine and it hurts you so much, think about how your body response to the actual virus would be.

Definitely take care of yourself and drink lots of water.",n7uy0j,2021-05-08 21:07:32
"yes, always tell the truth, especially if you end up in the ER like some people have from adverse reactions. I am definitely NOT getting my second dose, I felt awful for 1 month, and still have lingering issues. My cousin has been in and out of the ER for severe migraines, they get to the point where she practically blacks out, and she believes this has something to do with the jab, the more I read about these vaccines, the more questions I have.",n7uy0j,2021-05-08 21:03:36
Please watch this before you get another shot. https://youtu.be/pyPjAfNNA-U,n7uy0j,2021-05-09 03:31:26
"I posted my bad experience for both shots on here because as bad as it got- it beat having covid! And i got to hug my parents! 

I had a 103 fever and was just feeling AWFUL. But I had had a mild case of covid and that was pretty awful too. 

But that being said most of my friends had no symptoms to the shot. Like 80% which was dope! 

But yeah! I agree. I told everyone to prepare, I told my students (I teach uni class online) to just let me know if they needed extensions because I was totally out of commission for 36 hours. 

11/10 would get again- idk if I get more sick when the booster shot comes. I definitely got the worst symptoms from moderna that I’ve seen in this group - hallucinating fever dreams, arm hurts so bad I couldn’t sleep, brain fog, extreme mood swings, headache, itchy, awful period after, you name it! 

But yay for vaccine! And yes! Take time off! It passes fast. And take it from someone with a mild case of covid- it was way better than losing your taste and getting the mild symptoms haha",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 06:22:56
"Let us be thankful that they came with all those vaccines.  Why?  Because you complain about a swollen arm but asked one of the incubator survivors, they are not many, how nice it is to be fed bu a tube and breath by a ventilator.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 13:23:57
"I know that this is entirely based on anecdotal evidence  but people who have had COVID before tend to report strong experiences with the first shot, followed by an easier time with the second.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 21:06:00
It really does! I like the G2.,n7uy0j,2021-05-09 06:22:38
Thank you! I needed to hear this,n7uy0j,2021-05-08 23:36:01
I got my wisdom teeth out a few years ago and was put on amoxicillin. I took amoxicillin for five days before I suddenly broke out into itchy raised hives all over my body. So it could definitely have been the anitbiotic you took that had a delayed reaction!,n7uy0j,2021-05-13 07:00:43
"No nsaids for me, I'm allergic.  Extra strength Tylenol. But Gatorade is the real hero here.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 16:53:13
"I did have Covid, one of the first in my area. It felt about the same. Lasted two weeks plus. I hope this doesn't last that long.",n7uy0j,2021-05-08 21:18:32
"Three weeks in here, on prednisone and antibiotics trying to suppress immune response.. anything the try seem to help you or just time? 

Extreme fatigue,  chills/ body aches,  almost like hot flashes,  and severe migraines (I've had migraines my entire life,  but these are wicked and pretty much every night, sometimes I can abort it before it gets out of control but been to the ER several times for shots,  it had been 10 years since I had to go to the er for a shot before this).",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 01:41:40
"See, I think its important that people know this. To play it off like ""oh, it's so easy, minimal discomfort"" to get more people to get vaccinated is deceitful and makes people who have a strong reaction scared.  Plainly tell people that most cases are mild but quite a few are severe. Still better than covid. We are all adults and deserve the truth.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 13:14:12
You're missing the point. We should know what to expect.,n7uy0j,2021-05-09 13:27:04
I've heard that too. Scary who I exposed then trying to power through it. My dad is T1D. My mom has one kidney. So crazy.,n7uy0j,2021-05-09 21:12:23
"I’ll add to the anecdote. I had covid in November and it really kicked my ass for weeks. Never been that sick ever. 

I just got my 1st shot 3 days ago and it has been another ass kicking. 90% as bad as when I actually had covid (minus the coughing).",n7uy0j,2021-05-10 03:03:19
"Oh!  That's probably why you're reacting this way.  Folks who had covid and developed antibodies generally have a stronger reaction to the first shot.  Search on here or r/covidlonghaulers and you'll see this being talked about.

I'm a little past two days of my second shot, and while it was rough the first night, I'm fine as long as I drink a lot of fluids, avoid sugar, and take ibuprofen.  You doing these things?",n7uy0j,2021-05-08 22:55:51
"For real! So you can at least plan. Like stock up on fever reducers, take the afternoon off work, just get some emotional support, have dinner ready, like to prepare to be sick is really a luxury we have with this-

My mom got the vaccine at 70 as soon as it was available (phizer) and was sick both times for two days. No biggie because she’s retired and she’s happy to be vaccinated.  As soon as Biden signed in Pre-Existing condition people I got mine in early February- so as a 28 year old I had no idea what I was in for.  I’m very healthy (t2 diabetic well maintained, active, good BMI) so I was like the test run with my other friends and family and maybe 2 people I know got as sick as I did- my partner who had the exact same covid experience I did didnt even have a sore arm, which was the case with the rest of my friends haha. 

But they all prepared- because DAMN shit got real for me hahaha. I 1,000% agree. I don’t even know statistically what the chances are of getting as sick as I did- but if it’s like 5% that’s still high enough to want to know!",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 15:05:11
"If you didn’t know what to expect it’s kind of on you. You basically had the same symptoms as most people. I mean it’s in the TV news too. You’re in the same Subreddit everyone is posting to. I’ve seen plenty of the stories, yet you act like it was hidden?",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 18:57:16
Are they doing okay?,n7uy0j,2021-05-09 21:29:54

This does not prepare someone for a strong reaction. A few days? Some people can have flu symptoms for up to three weeks and it's still considered normal. I didn't look up this sub until after I was very sick. I just saw the pamphlet that gave a 2-3 day range. And when I went on social media to ask if anyone else was having this kind of reaction I was told that I must have ulterior motives. I must be an anti vaxxer (which is why I got the vaccine *s*/)
Why would it bother you that we are talking about this? I didn't make you read any of this. Go somewhere else.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 19:20:52
"They're fine. Never caught anything from us, thank goodness.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 21:39:36
"I’m not claiming you’re an antivaxxer. CDC article outlines the same symptoms you had, so I’m not sure how they are trying to hide it? You are acting like there is some ulterior motive. They are giving the best guideline they can with the information they have. 
 
This subreddit hasn’t been the place that’s calling those people or you antivax you posting this makes it seem they are purposefully removing posts or something. I’ve been on this for awhile and it used to be only negative ones.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 19:26:26
I came on here just to compare symptoms.  I didn't get defensive until I was messaged.,n7uy0j,2021-05-09 19:29:15
"You made a post about “be straight with us” essentially insinuating either the companies that make the vaccine, the CDC, or this sub is purposefully misleading people or are pushing adverse reactions out of the news. 

Maybe I just interpreted your post wrong, but that is how it comes off.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 19:32:09
"I'm sorry if that's how I came across.  I was on a different social media site  and I became frustrated because I was accused of lying about the severity of my symptoms.  When others started to say they also had severe side effects, thats when I was bombed by people I didn't know accusing me of being a lying anti vaxxer. And then of course, the true anti vaxxers had to get on and start piling up their bullshit too. I finally had to delete my post because it was becoming a political battle and all I wanted was to know when I was going to feel better and if I should go take up space in an ER or urgent care (my pcp is closed Fri- Sunday). I looked this up and came on here and posted that be straight with us out of pure fear and frustration.  It actually makes me feel better to know that others are having severe reactions too. I have developed a cough and that's not in the cdc stuff, but people on here have too so I'm  not as worried. Tomorrow I will call my provider and get the real deal but for this weekend, reddit helped me cope.",n7uy0j,2021-05-09 19:56:48

Second day of twitching I kept getting sharp pains in my right leg, opposite the side I got the shot. I took a lot of baths and drank Gatorade. Only time helped really. I dread shot 2.

"Mine hit me in the middle of the night, so I definitely felt worse in the morning but I hadn’t had any symptoms until 3am or so. So I don’t think you’ll necessarily feel worse day 2 given that you’ve already had fairly strong symptoms.",n8533o,2021-05-09 06:14:56
"I got my 2nd shot at 9am Friday morning, and the only symptoms I had on day two were the sore arm and fatigue (I took a 3 hour nap). The first day I also had a slight headache that night, and I was feeling pretty cold, so I bundled up a bit. My heart rate was also a bit elevated. All in all, the side effects I experienced were minimal.",n8533o,2021-05-09 09:17:53

I have a hard time keeping food down, want to throw up all the time, my cousin has it worse though, her headaches are so bad she has been to the ER several times, she blacks out. I just feel awful fatigue to the point I am having a hard time focusing on work.

"I had a somewhat similar experience with Pfizer

**First dose**-  very mild, more arm soreness than the second one but nothing much to complain about

**Second dose**- the shot itself hurt a lot more than the first, and it felt like the RN pushed the plunger in very quickly (I felt a 'ball' of vaccine in my arm, like it didn't have time to dissipate). Some dizziness around the 4 hour mark, which very well could have been psychosomatic

At pretty much exactly the 13 hour mark, a chill set in very quickly out of nowhere. I pulled myself under the covers, and I started shivering pretty intensely, it felt more severe than just being out in the cold too long. That lasted ~30 min and I got to sleep, waking up a half-dozen times absolutely soaked with sweat. The morning after was much better, with some fatigue, fogginess, and headache but that's about it

Very glad to have gotten it done, and I was aware the side effects were generally worse for the second dose, but I was not well prepared for the sudden, intense tremoring and fever",n7rfig,2021-05-08 16:50:05
I think that hydrating yourself very well does make a difference I got both of my shots already and didn’t have any side effects besides a sore arm.. I did make sure the same day and after I was hydrated. basically I was making sure that every time I urinated it was water clear before and after the shots.,n7rfig,2021-05-08 20:26:04
"Thank you for the details, I appreciate it. Shot 2 is on Tuesday and I’m so nervous. I’m definitely prepping with Gatorade, water and Advil. I’m going to have socks close by and my sweater in case the chills come. I get cold easily and I shiver a lot during winter so I know how I feel shivering and I hate it lol. 

So about your shot, my first shot hurt it felt like I was stabbed. My husband agreed the lady wasn’t gentle at all, he had bruising immediately after. I think the pain vs no pain depends on the nurse/doctor giving the shot. I never felt the vaccine in me but right after my arm felt like it weighed 100 pounds. All my friends got Pfizer and only one had bad flu symptoms, everyone else only head headaches. Seems like moderna is way more intense",n7rfig,2021-05-09 01:42:57
"Yeah, it was weird how different the second actual shot felt.  Didn't feel the ball, but did feel a little something enter my body.  Is the second dose bigger?  I never bothered to look into that.

The chills thing was weird how it came out of nowhere.  I got up a lot both bad nights (see the fluids I drank...), so after a pretty predictable feverish pattern, the cold just quick hit me in my fourth or fifth trip to the bathroom.  I finished up and got back under the covers, but that didn't help much, with that uncontrolled shivering like you.  

Appointments here were tough to get initially, and I actually landed Pfizer first, but it was a bit of a haul to get there.  I cancelled shortly after when I was able to land something closer, w/ Moderna.  There's that part of me that wonders what my experience would've been like had I stuck with Pfizer.",n7rfig,2021-05-08 17:52:16
"I'd definitely recommend it, though unfortunately the extra hydration didn't completely spare me from some nasty side effects the second time around.  Probably would've been worse for me if I hadn't, though!",n7rfig,2021-05-09 16:45:36
"Good luck!  Sounds like you're as prepared as you can be, might not hurt to start the extra hydrating now if you haven't already.

I had the same pharmacist for both shots, but she may be exhausted at this point by all the vaccines she has to administer in addition to the day-to-day tasks of a very demanding job, so her technique may reflect that.",n7rfig,2021-05-09 16:43:46
"I bought a case of Powerade today (hope it’s as good as Gatorade) and I’m drinking them! I agree, the pharmacists are probably just tired of giving the shots lol. My appointment is 9 am so if it’s the same woman I hope she’s not in a bad mood yet😂",n7rfig,2021-05-09 16:58:05
Thanks for sharing! I’ve noticed everyone who says their side effects were mild all hydrated and got electrolytes in them! I’m definitely doing that (shot 2 is on Tuesday. So nervous!!),n7og74,2021-05-08 14:15:29

"I am roughly 18 hours post 2nd shot. Minimal symptoms. Temp was 99.2 this morning. My arm hurts worse than the first one but I'm still waving it around and lifting it every 10 mins or so. My body aches a bit, like I did a full body workout yesterday, and my arm hair hurts (which is how I knew I was sick when I was a kid), but nothing too bad. Very slight headache. Haven't taken acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

Before the shot I drank roughly 1.5 times the normal amount of water I would normally drink, PLUS Gatorade and tea or coffee. 

Also, the sunshine and hot, humid Florida Spring weather feels *amazing* today.",n7og74,2021-05-08 15:57:29

I also made sure that I was very hydrated before and after the shot, literally making sure that every time I pee it was like water.",n7wcv5,2021-05-08 20:38:43
"I got my first one yesterday and have honestly felt fine for the most part - think a lot of it also has to do with anxiousness and nerves. If you keep reading the horror stories and anticipating it, you might end up feeling more crappy and have somatic symptoms.

Anyway, I got my favorite food on the way home, changed into something loose and comfy and just planned to relax in bed most of the day. I only took 200mg ibuprofen before bed because I started to feel some pain and tightness but woke up feeling 80% recovered.
As of right now I have a low grade 99° temp, but took ibuprofen again and am packing to continue with my weekend out of town plans :)",n7wcv5,2021-05-08 21:34:27
"I agree with what others are saying. The one you really have to self-care with is the second one. Don’t plan anything the next day, drink tons of water, have pain relievers/fever meds ready.

You’re entitled to your opinion, but seeking out a group of people that have already gotten vaccinated is not the way to go to spread your message against big pharma. It comes off as shaming or scaring others who’ve already made a decision based on their own judgement. If you and I have more in common than the execs at big pharma companies, why are you seeking out your fellow man? Especially a person that has already taken the shot? 

I agree with you on how shitty big pharma is. They didn’t make the vaccines out of the goodness of their heart, I’m not delusional. We are dollar signs to them. However, I trust science  behind the mRNA vaccine based on the opinions of scientists, epidemiologists and public health experts not involved in the profits. And yes, I trust the CDC and FDA on this and I got the vaccine accordingly. If you think I’m dumb for that, that’s your opinion. I’d still get the shots again, and as soon as booster shots are available for new strains, I’ll be the first in line.

The bottom line is we both believe different things- that we both believe are fact. There is no getting around that. It’s agree to disagree, but don’t come into a support group for people discussing symptoms after getting the vaccine to take your anger out on big pharma.

Oh no! I hope you feel better soon!,n7djs7,2021-05-09 03:01:22
I’m feeling much better! I will get the second shot but not too excited. They said I had a potential allergic reaction. My theory is it flaired up pre existing conditions I’ve already had up. Lots of inflammation in my body. I had a bad hangover from drinking too much a few days later that was way worse than the shot. I guess I’ll get the second one. Idk. 🤔,n7djs7,2021-05-18 23:49:17
"I'm 22 days into my first dose and the side effects are still effecting me every day.  I'm tired.. sleeping 10, 12, 16 hours doesn't keep me from yawning all day.  I'm short on breath after exerting any energy.   Headaches almost daily.  Vision jumps / loses focus.    Are these the same effects you had?    My second does is scheduled for Thursday and I'm not sure what to do.",n7acqb,2021-05-08 01:36:02
"Man its crazy the differences in side effects people have. The 1st dose just made me tired and a headache for a day, and the 2nd one just made me tired for a day and thats it.  Never had a fever, pain in my arm, nothing. Doesnt really seem fair and I dont understand it.",n7acqb,2021-05-08 05:16:36
Drink lots of Gatorade! It really helps,n7acqb,2021-05-08 01:11:49
"My husband and I just had our second dose on Thursday and holy cow! After the first dose all we had was muscle soreness and a little headache. After this dose was severe chills, mild fever, nausea, vomited once(barely anything came out), dizziness and then migraines. Felt better overall after vomiting and the worst of it lasted like 4 hours but omg I thought I was dying. Day 2 and I’m feeling much better, my husband seemed to be hit harder.",n7acqb,2021-05-08 12:18:17
"Fwiw, it took me two months to recover from acute covid and then I went long hauler. On the couch myself today after dose 2 yesterday, but just hang in and know that it's entirely worth it.",n7acqb,2021-05-08 03:55:38
"I empathize so much with this. I believe the vaccine is very necessary and everyone who can get vaccinated should do so, but the side effects were debilitating for me after the first shot and the second was hard on me too. 

After the first shot I had migraines for 3.5 weeks; like you I felt well again just 3 days before my second shot. Only 12 hours after my second shot I came down with terrible body aches, chills, and headaches. I sweated through my pajamas and sheets and was utterly miserable. I threw up only once but had barely any appetite for 3-4 days after. The first 24 hours were the absolute worst but it took me several days to feel okay again.  

On day 5 after my second shot I felt the best I’d felt since I got my first shot. I could play with my kid and do yardwork and actually ENJOY a beautiful spring day. I feel that I essentially lost a month of my life to post-vaccine migraines. It’s been a depressing and difficult time for me and my little family. But...better than the alternative.",n7acqb,2021-05-08 09:19:16
"I feel for you, that was exactly me. I could hardly do anything. About a week before my second dose, I started to feel like myself again, I even helped my mom move which was strenuous physically but I didn't have any problems. I was really reconsidering the second dose but decided to get it. I would encourage you to because I know that it sucks now but in about three weeks it will have been worth it. I hope you feel better :)",n7acqb,2021-05-08 02:54:20
" Wow maybe if they researched it more, they could figure out who or why some ppl have worse side effects and how to help them.  It really does seem unfair.",n7acqb,2021-05-08 06:13:46
"[From the CDC on the Moderna:](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html)  

Systemic reactions were reported by the majority of vaccine recipients and at higher rates than placebo recipients. The frequency of systemic reactions was higher in the younger age group than the older age group (81.9% vs 71.9% after dose 2).",n7acqb,2021-05-08 06:25:14
" That doesn’t tell us much, what to watch out for or how to reverse side effects.",n7acqb,2021-05-08 06:37:06
Correct.,n7acqb,2021-05-08 07:01:32
"Yes! 

I thought it was in my head. Since I got dose one, 4 days ago, my right eye has felt off. I'm a contacts wearer so I just assumed it was my contact bugging me, took them out and the feeling is still there three days later. I had a headache in the same spot behind my eye days 2 and 3. Pretty certain it's inflammation from the vaccine, all the spots that I have had injured previously are aggravated.",n7pi7k,2021-05-08 19:39:25
"My personal experience, Tylenol helped with the arm pain and headaches after the first shot.

No arm pain after the second, but I had awful headaches.  Tried Tylenol first, and it did nothing this time.  Swapped to Advil, and that helped significantly.  

If you can, I'd recommend having both on hand.",n7ls8d,2021-05-08 16:28:45
Both are good but I read Advil is better for inflammation. I have Advil in my house and I’m going to use it in case of fever and pain with shot 2,n7ls8d,2021-05-08 14:44:23

I just got my first moderna shot and the pharmacist said to only take Tylenol. Not Advil. Not sure why but she was very clear,n7ls8d,2021-05-08 17:53:44
Advil,n7ls8d,2021-05-08 22:15:41
unfortunately i only have advil 😭,n7ls8d,2021-05-08 19:42:33
"Advil is NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), which means it suppresses your immune system. You don’t want your immune system to be suppressed by NSAIDs especially when you want your body to build up an immune response against the vaccine. Tylenol is analgesic, which is a pain reliever with no inflammatory response. Just my 2 cents! :)",n7ls8d,2021-05-08 18:32:15
I only had my first shot but it gave me palpitations too. I had a fever and aches. I’m actually scared for my second lol.,n7jx6u,2021-05-08 10:44:45
"I didn’t get heart palpitations because I’m on beta blockers for my tachycardia but I just wanted to say that prior to beta blockers I had tachycardia every single time I was sick, even with a cold, so not uncommon to feel your heart racing during an immune response! If you’ve had this occur before I wouldn’t stress it’ll likely go away after your immune system has handled the threat",n7jx6u,2021-05-08 12:05:11
"I also had heart palpitations on the first shot, around 15 minutes right after I got it. I just forced myself into deep breathing until it slowed down. For around 2 days, I would have random fast heartbeats for no reason, especially when I was just lying down or watching stuff on the computer. I'd do the deep breathing again until it went away. 

It seems to have disappeared though, I'm on day 13 now. I hope when I get shot #2, it won't happen again because it was a horrible feeling.",n7jx6u,2021-05-08 12:06:13
"Shot #1 did the same to me (palpitations), I went to the ER ever other day in March (EKG and Echocardiogram were normal)!
Started calming down after 3 weeks, in time for shot #2! Same happened after shot #2, I’m now 4 weeks post shot 2, and it’s calmed down considerably!",n7jx6u,2021-05-08 14:03:58
Thanks dude this was super comforting!! I appreciate the response,n7jx6u,2021-05-08 17:33:28
"It makes me feel better to see the arm wasn’t as sore as the first. 

I thought the second lady that gave me the vaccine didn’t do it right since it wasn’t sore like the first. So thanks for sharing this!!",n7do6n,2021-05-09 03:13:43
"Plan to have tomorrow off, prep some easy food to eat tomorrow and have extra hydration and tylenol handy and you'll be all good :) 
Dont forget to move that arm around too, welcome to the fully vaccinated club!",n7amud,2021-05-07 23:30:28

"Drink water as well. I’m 10 days after #2 and can only think of a sore arm for 24 or so hours. 

My wife is four days after #2, slight sore arm.

All in all, pretty uneventful for us. 

Good luck!",n7amud,2021-05-08 01:21:30
"I didn’t feel anything with the first shot. But I got the second yesterday and around 10pm is where the hot flashes started and body ached. I was awake every 2 hours chugging pedialyte , taking Tylenol and stretching. I felt so cold but was biting under the blankets. Temp got to 100.5. I felt crappy when I woke up and weak. Now it’s 8 at night and I’m slowing feeling “ normal “",n7amud,2021-05-08 02:46:21
" I was super worried about 2nd dose but the 1st dose was way worse. And it wasn't even that bad, just a headache and felt tired for a day.  This time I was just tired for a day and that was it.  I don't understand how people have such different reactions.",n7amud,2021-05-08 05:19:27

Mine got worse before it got better and lasted a few days/ almost a week and then went away completely. I know it’s worrisome but it appears to be very common so don’t be too concerned.,n7kgbc,2021-05-08 10:11:21
"I had it on the same day as the first shot and then it disappeared on the 3rd or 4th day. Then it reappeared on the 9th day as a small hard lump of meat, but it was just itchy, very little pain so I ignored it until it somehow disappeared yesterday or so. I can't see it anymore and pain is almost non-existent. Actually I just rubbed my arm now and I can't even feel the minimal pain from yesterday, I guess it's gone for now... until shot #2.",n7kgbc,2021-05-08 12:02:31
After my first shot I got Covid arm on the 8th day. It lasted about 5 days. After my second shot I got it on the 3rd day and it only lasted for 2-3 days. It disappeared completely after that.,n7kgbc,2021-05-08 12:06:36
"I got mine on Day 8. It got pretty hard, big, and *hot*, but then the swelling and itching went down in a day or two.

I have been cooling it a lot and the only thing I took was cetirizin for two evenings. I’m happy and now that I see it’s healing I am so relieved. (I always panic too early).

"I’m a 47/Female and got my 2nd shot yesterday at 12pm. I’ve had very mild body aches and felt cold (but no real chills). If I take 2 Tylenol all my symptoms go away. It feels like a very mild hangover. I’m not tired but my body and head feel a bit heavy. 

I took today off from work just in case but have spent the day doing errands and cleaning out my closet.",n6x6sn,2021-05-07 18:38:41

"that’s awesome I hope you feel fine I had my second shot a week ago. I didn’t get any side effects on both shots at all only a sore arm and that’s about it. One advice I could give you is move your arm even if it hurts just move it. Another thing that I think it helped was the fact that I convinced myself that I wasn’t gonna get any side effects because I have to take care of my little ones and also tried to stay as hydrated as possible literally watching if my urine was cristal clear. 

how did you do on your first shot?",n79ni4,2021-05-08 21:19:24

She had the swollen, itchy, painful arm the day after, along with fever and aches.  These subsided quickly, though the stomach issue lasted quite a bit longer.  They are both doing really well now, still masking up, but enjoying working outside and are having a great spring with less worry.

They received their last dose a couple of months ago.. I am thinking March 4th, but I could be wrong.  I know other older folks who got their doses at a similar time and haven't experienced any adverse reactions.

Wishing your mother all of the luck!",n79pue,2021-05-08 04:56:02

"Similar issues,  most Dr's are pretty dismissive and just pushing how important getting the second vaccine is. Which is honestly more of a turn off to me from getting it.  Let's deal with my reaction first atleast?  Good lord. 

I wave up and down, but constant body aches and chills, extremely lethargic,  and my migraines have been getting worse daily. I've had to go to the er several times for an abortive.

"I have a lot of the same stuff going on. I got my first shot on 4/20 and I'm sitting here icing my arm at the injection site because it hurts so bad still. My best guess from the hours upon hours of reading about other people's experiences is that a lot of our problems are from inflammation. I have tinnitus, vertigo/dizziness, chest and back pain, fatigue, anxiety, and joint pain. Large amounts of inflammation from the immune response is the only thing I can come up with to explain all of them. I really messed up my shoulder/elbow/ribs from a huge spill I took bombing a big hill on my skateboard that I think broke all 3 but I never went to get it checked out. Just so happens those are the biggest sources of pain and where I got injected. Lets us know what you find out brother/sister.",n70ooa,2021-05-07 23:41:05

Its very unfortunate, I spoke with my GP and he said my brain fog, and waking up with a headache is normal, and just anxiety probably after the shot???

"39y/o  
First shot, other than the very sore arm, I had a really weird nap on the second day but that's it.  However, think hard about what arm you choose.  I chose my left arm since I'm a righty, but i sleep on my left side so that was rough. I also wish I had thought about icing it soon, it was heavenly. 
The second shot, I chose my right.  I just wish I had put away the dishes and done the laundry before hand.
For the second shot, i didnt have any issues except the arm. Then i discovered the ice...  🤤
10 days later though...  
I had Covid for a few hours!?! 
1am crazy shivering, can't get warm in scalding hot shower
4am woke up struggling to breathe
Itchy, hot skin with rash
Probable fever
Stuffy nose
Wheezing gagging cough
Slight sore throat
And a weird ass mind fog

It lasted only an hour! 
I laid back down so I could wake up early an find a rapid test so I could see if it was a breakthrough, but I woke up 5 hours later like nothing had happened, except my skin was sensitive all day. 

All in all, in retrospect, very worth it, and it gave me a chance to experience it without really getting it.",n6ohco,2021-05-07 07:06:38

Right now my fever is staying at 100  F and I feel exhausted but can’t sleep.  Body aches are a lot better though.",n73ugu,2021-05-08 00:59:39
"I honestly think a lot of this is anxiety. I had some trouble sleeping the night before my shot, and the day after my first dose I felt really weird, flushed, nausea, etc for a couple of hours. And it all went away. The only real symptom I can attribute to the vaccine is a small amount of injection site pain that lasted a day or two. Honestly, the weirdness I felt could have been the Chinese takeout I ate. I had to stop eating and then took it easy for a few hours. Who knows? It does pass.",n73agi,2021-05-08 05:48:29
"I got my second one yesterday at 4. Woke up at 4 this morning after terrible dreams, feeling the aches terribly. Also felt like I was drunk. It hit my husband the same time last night. Same thing, minus the nightmares but with the chills. 

We feel like we got hit by a bus. Been in bed all day. Worth it though. Lol.

Edit to add: i feel like I normally do when I have a0 really bad cold. Can't sleep because I can't get comfortable enough. Light nodding off, but no substantial zzz's.",n734px,2021-05-07 19:49:25

"43M, had my first shot on April 30th. My symptoms were like yours, maybe milder. I had no issues getting the shot or in the waiting room or anything at all that first day (got my shot at 1PM). The next day was as usual, I did my workout, went shopping, etc. It wasn't until dinner time the day after the shot that I literally started feeling ""weird"" while eating. Felt nausea coming on. I stopped eating, took some Pepto, and went to my office. I felt a little racey, rundown, and just plain ""weird"". This lasted for about 4 hours until shortly before bedtime when I felt normal again. I was 100% the next day. The only symptom other than the ones I described above was a very slight pain in the muscle of the injection site. That lasted 2 days.",n6zua0,2021-05-08 05:14:03
"Some details:

28M, seasonal allergies, healthy

I went to clinic that booked appointments and limited people to only with appointments. There wasn't a lineup so I don't think I got exposed to something while waiting.

So these bumps showed up on my knuckles, fingers and elbows exactly 1 week after the shot. They are localized to the joints and, and the joints feel swollen. My hands are swollen as well. There really isn't any pus unless I squeeze them hard. There super itchy, red and bumpy. 

Its now 2 weeks since I git the shot. I was prescribed steroid cream which isn't really helping. Benadryl I think helps but at this pint I'm not even sure if that. Doctor just thinks it's my immune system being hyperactive and building a strong response.

Anybody else have something similar?",n6r7nk,2021-05-07 06:36:22

They are super itchy. They've been receding so hopefully they'll just go on there own.,n6r7nk,2021-05-09 08:11:31
"I had this too - I felt totally fine after my first shot until about day 7. If you search “Moderna arm” you’ll see that this happens to some people, I think like 0.8% on the first dose and 0.2% on the second. Mine went away after a few days and then was totally fine. Hang in there!",n6yho0,2021-05-07 16:04:47
"I had this ten days after my first shot.  I was freaked out until I did some research, but it seems common with the Moderna vaccine.  I waited to contact my doctor and felt like I would scream from the itchiness.. wish I had called sooner.  They suggested benadryl anti itch cream and benadryl tablets, as well.  Both helped tremendously!  Cool compresses also worked well for me.  My doctor's office made sure to tell me to get my second vaccine in the opposite arm.  It took about three weeks for it to heal completely, but no idea how long it would have taken if I hadn't started the antihistamine treatment.  Most folks seem to have it for less time.

I talked with the doctor and nurse who administered my second vaccine on Wednesday and they spoke about covid arm, saying that those who had experienced lymphedema before seemed more likely to develop this rash.  I had lymphedema in the past, so I fit their observation.  So weird!  This time around, I started itching on the second day and it's turned into full blown covid arm on day three.",n6yho0,2021-05-08 05:05:19

"Major hunger after the first dose. Haven't got my second one yet, but it's insane. I can eat a whole meal and within half and hour I'm starving so much, that my stomach is growling. It's not really that pleasant to be honest. Hope it goes away",n6gh94,2021-05-07 01:42:22
Good for you as long as you remain healthy. I am 15 hours post 2nd dose and have only had 2 bowls of cereal and a v8. Can’t say I’m hungry either😀,n6gh94,2021-05-07 01:06:27
"Ive been the same way! After being sick and queezy for 2 or 3 days after the vaccine, I'm finding myself forgetting to eat. I  have three toddlers so its not uncommon prior to the vaccine, but I have noticed just not being hungry. I have also noticed an increase in my anxiety. Weird.",n6gh94,2021-05-07 01:46:10
"Something similar to me. I definitely still have an appetite, maybe a little less ferocious. However, certain foods that I loved before seem to totally put me off now. I got a chicken salad from a restaurant I frequent yesterday and the texture made me throw the whole thing away. I’ve never had texture issues before. There has been two other instances involving texture since I’ve gotten my second vaccine as well. I really didn’t connect the dots, and they may not be related whatsoever and merely a coincidence, but now you’ve got me wondering.",n6gh94,2021-05-07 01:51:54

"😶 getting my second tomorrow. Yesterday I started feeling nausea out of nowhere, haven't eaten much and a two day stint of no more than three hours total (thanks a lot...insomnia). It took a lot to even eat three pieces of homemade chicken nuggets and made me feel not so good tonight. My appetite is a major struggle so...maybe this'll happen for me and I'll get used to the lack of appetite.

Will def contact if happens. I wanna win the vaccine lottery lol",n6gh94,2021-05-07 05:47:12
"I have also had no appetite after getting both vaccines, but i also didn’t have too much of one before getting the first. I was binge eating every day like a month prior. I believe it has to do with being extremely stressed and (pandemic) anxiety (in my case). I had an abdominal CT scan recently and nothing was noticeably wrong. I’ve lost 40 pounds in the past 5 months non-intentionally, but now finally starting to maintain a weight and am now noticing a slight hunger feeling more often than before. (I got my second dose of Moderna on 4-17). This whole ordeal was very new to me because I was told I have PCOS and i have never really been able to lose weight, but hey as long as it’s not hurting me, I won’t complain.",n6gh94,2021-05-07 08:12:53

"So I replied to your comment on the other post. I’ve lost 5 lbs since April 13th when I got my second shot and my appetite sucks. I am having texture issues bad, too, like someone said above. 
Interestingly, I also have a sleep disorder (idiopathic hypersomnia). I am medicated, though. Narcolepsy affects satiety perception and weight gain is common. Perhaps with its neurological effects, the spike protein is messing with the same area of the brain or something along the pathway?
Unfortunately for me, I’m already close to underweight, so if I lose much more my doc is going to take my meds away and I’ll be a useless zombie. Just got stuff to make smoothies this week. I need to figure out how to put on some muscle so I don’t just gain fat to appease them. I never in my life thought I would have these problems.",n6gh94,2021-05-07 14:20:19
I had my first dose almost a month ago and have no appetite but it makes it harder because I still experience nausea and headaches from not eating. Currently forcing myself to eat some plain white rice as it seems the only thing I can tolerate at the moment. It’s been so frustrating as I can’t even enjoy the benefit. Lol.,n6gh94,2021-05-18 17:41:56

Maybe I will make a post in the narcolepsy thread too and see what kind of hits I get... this is really interesting since that vaccine years ago triggered narcolepsy in a bunch of people.",n6gh94,2021-05-07 15:29:27

"Really? Which one? Looking back I had symptoms since childhood, but they got considerably worse after my head injury and adenoviral infection in 2018. Adenovirus caused post viral syndrome (myocarditis, probably my pulmonary artery aneurysm, some leaky valves and some other weird stuff at the time like blood clotting factors and kidney stuff), much like coronavirus is with people now. The sleep disorder was diagnosed after that, I think even if it was there before, it was made worse by that.

I believe the consensus is that a vaccine component / protein was similar to Orexin / Hypocretin and the vaccine went after it in the brain... very simplified version. You can do more Googling. I had symptoms from early childhood after a fall from a 2 story window and mine got even worse after I got mono as a teen.

I would't doubt viruses and vaccines could trigger / flip the switch in predisposed  narcolepsy people. I am 100% in favor of vaccines but I don't doubt some people will have rare side effects.",n6gh94,2021-05-07 21:42:34

I developed a cough and had breathing issues on the evening of the third day. Then my heart started working overtime. My dr. Started me back on asthma treatments.  My second shot was 3/19/21. I am still struggling. It seems to come and go during the day.  If I didn’t know better I would think I am experiencing congestive heart failure.  The thing is I have a neighbor who also had an adverse impact too and is still suffering more than a month later. We are 65-70 years old. I have asthma under control. So two tests administered this week show interstital lung disease and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.  Blood work shows inflammation and low potassium.

"OP, I also had huge reactions to my Moderna vaccines. Many the same as you. The burning skin, the enlarged lymph nodes, the depression, crying, I'll never know if it was because (1) I had Covid back in December, (2) because the vaccine reacted weirdly with the 3 prescription medicines I must take daily, or (3) it was ""simply"" my particular body freaking out.  My husband and I both had the virus at the same time. He got much sicker than I. However, my symptoms lasted for months.  Then... we got the first and second Moderna vaccines at the same time. He felt almost nothing after the first and absolutely nothing after the second.  I felt awful after the first, with symptoms lasting for weeks. After the second I was actually laying in the bed whimpering, which I've never done in my life. I felt like I would expire any minute.  The entire thing has been quite an experience to say the least, and one I don't want to do again. But I've definitely learned that no two people have the same symptoms or response to either the virus or the vaccine. Every person, every...  body... is unique and will react differently.  Chin up, you'll feel MUCH better soon.",n67879,2021-05-06 17:20:44

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are nearly bit-for-bit identical--the primary difference is the Moderna is a slightly larger dose. You seem to be having some rare allergic reaction to it that probably (though of course no guarantee) would've been similar if you'd gotten Pfizer. Sorry to hear about your struggles :(,n67879,2021-05-06 23:44:55
"All of the symptoms you described could be psychosomatic/anxiety related.  This is not to be dismissive- I believe what you feel is real and you are not imagining or making them up. I have experienced extreme anxiety and panic disorder and have had it manifest in physical symptoms that are undeniably felt.  But I’ve come to learn that anxiety can cause a lot of this bc the brain is where all this stuff goes down.  
I’m not trying to advise the vaccine should be ruled out as the cause but just to recommend reading about psychosomatic symptoms from anxiety. In my experience the more I learned about how the brain works when that’s activated, the more coping mechanisms I was able to employ- hope you feel better soon.",n67879,2021-05-06 16:54:55

I’m so sorry this is happening. I’m also pretty pro vaccine but I was scared to death. I cannot take the flu shot but thankfully I didn’t have the same reactions as a flu shot. I teach so it was prob in everyone’s best Interest for me to get it.

"I REALLY hope I don't come off like a jerk saying this, but maybe a lot of this is anxiety related symptoms rather than anything from the vaccine? The way you're feeling is exactly the symptoms I experience when my anxiety is really bad and I can't get a grip on it for several weeks. Also, Moderna and Pfizer just aren't that different, so I wouldn't beat yourself up over that. Anxiety can cause all types of pain and discomfort. I was very anxious about getting my 2nd dose and had convinced myself I was going to he in misery for weeks.",n67879,2021-05-06 17:27:53

"I am 4 weeks out and dealing with similar symptoms. The out of control anxiety and depression is exactly what I felt. I got tingling in my right leg 15 minutes after the first shot and the first doctor I saw dismissed it and said it was unlikely the vaccine. The second doctor said it was definitely the vaccine and basically said it’s just how my immune system is responding. 4 weeks out I feel okay but I still get muscle weakness, hand tremors, weird muscle spasm, worsening tinnitus and my right foot gets really cold. I went on SSRI antidepressant to control the anxiety two weeks ago which is a game changer for me. Also on CBT for past two years to manage my anxiety (which was totally manageable) and my regular mental health counselling did not help me, I could not rely on my regular coping mechanisms, it was scary. And I’ve decided to look for a new therapist in the meantime to see if I just need a new perspective but I was in a bad place. I honestly believe you when you say the vaccine induced a strong anxiety response. The brain is weird and unknown so I don’t know when it will ever be formally recognized as a side effect but I feel you.",n67879,2021-05-06 20:37:17

"I’m so sorry you’re dealing with these issues! I got both vaccines, but after my first one in March, I had bad anxiety that lasted about a month and is a little better today. I am otherwise healthy, haven’t had Covid, and haven’t experienced any life changes to bring on the anxiety. I was really glad to get the vaccine, so I had no lingering anxiety prior. Purely by coincidence, I had my annual physical two weeks after that first vaccine and all my bloodwork came back normal. 

Still glad to have gotten both vaccines, but I’m really interested to know if there’s a link. It’s frustrating to me that anytime I try to find research articles pointing a link to anxiety, every result brings back people being generally anxious about the vaccine. I really felt that for me, at least, it wasn’t a psychosomatic reaction. It’s frustrating to see so many comments saying as much.",n67879,2021-05-07 00:43:12

The docs prescribed me kind of a catch all for insomnia, limb movements, anxiety, etc and it has helped dramatically.

I had some very similar reactions FOR A MONTH AND A HALF after 1st dose. I am now 78% - 98% better.

"I'm really not trying to be mean here, but if you began feeling these symptoms the minute after the first shot, there is a very good chance these symptoms are psychosomatic, meaning they're anxiety driven symptoms. And anxiety can 100% manifest itself into physical symptoms. Things like this just don't happen a minute after you get the vaccine. I would look into reading some cbt books or finding a cbt therapist where you teach yourself to not fear these physical sensations and eventually they stop bothering you and then they disappear.

I hope your doctor figures out what's going on soon, but I don't think it'd hurt to read some cbt and see if some of the symptoms are also from anxiety and can even partially relieve some of the discomfort.

"And here you go - still doing the same thing, now this time just with more assumptions. I have a blood clotting disorder. I have stayed close to home for nearly a year because this virus could be really bad for me. But of course you don’t know that, right? You just assumed it. And your assumptions turned into projections. 

And calling those of us that got vaccinated lab rats? Again finding joy in other people’s pain. Calling grown adults names? It costs nothing to be empathetic and human.",n67879,2021-05-06 17:21:05

"I am very familiar with cognitive behavior therapy. I’m a certified behavior analyst actually (work treating children/adults) with Autism. 
I did not have any tachycardia or trouble breathing as do many people experiencing anxiety. And even if these symptoms would have been anxiety related, it would have been over with a long time ago. 2 months in. I’m not dismissing the power of the brain. I think meditation, diet and breathing exercises also work. But the vaccine triggered a probably already existing autoimmune disorder or it could have caused it. I may never know. But this crap is not in my head. Whatever group you’re in doesn’t prove it wasn’t. There’s still so much research waiting to happen.",n67879,2021-05-06 23:51:32
"Pretty sure there's been more clotting reports with the shots than the virus.

I think your problem is how arrogant you are. Your body has been crippled by this experimental drug, and instead of questioning your assumptions, you double down. 

Look, I've had a lot of vaccines in my life, but those were tested for decades, and were for viruses that were way deadlier. 

Getting a vaccine tested for 50 years to prevent meningitis is reasonable. Getting an experimental drug tested for less than a year for a virus, even someone with your condition, that statistically would be unlikely to cause you severe issues... is arrogant.",n67879,2021-05-06 17:27:19
"Hey there! I have anxiety as well, not to the degree you do, but after my first shot, I had such an anxiety attack and days of paranoia. I also have IBS and it caused such a flair up that I was so sick (vomiting). I’m getting my second one tomorrow and trying to remain calm. As much as I am worried about the vaccine and anxieties around it, I’m 10x more worried about covid. I’ve been panicked for months and in a state of anxiety from the pandemic. I know it may seem scary right now, but it’s best to try and weigh the positives of you’re now protected from covid!! And one step closer to normal life :)",n67879,2021-05-07 05:49:28
"The group I'm referring to isn't about anxiety, it's about tinnitus post covid vaccination. My point being I don't think you can't have side effects from a vaccine, of course you can. But the ones that happened within a minute of getting the vaccine, I'd probably try to do some cbt on and see if there's any improvement. And it's totally possible for physical symptoms from anxiety to last longer than 2 months. They can last 6 months even years. And you already know the cbt tools well so that's even better!",n67879,2021-05-07 00:06:23
"If your retort is seriously that covid isn’t that serious and I should’ve just taken a chance and not gotten the vaccine even with a chronic illness, I think this is where this back and forth ends.",n67879,2021-05-06 17:31:33
So you don’t think the vaccine can cause my immune system to attack itself this fast? Well my neurologists seem to disagree and they have a degree. So there you go. I am not anti vax. But I do know it triggered it despite your opinion.,n67879,2021-05-07 03:04:58
"The vaccine has a higher link to blood clots than the virus. Is that not good enough evidence for you?

No worries, this is a human reaction. You are likely to double down on a bad decision like this. If you were to have gotten this experimental drug, and it crippled your body, AND it turns out you didn't need it... well your mind can't deal with that. It would be too painful, so you'll construct a reality where your reckless action was justified.",n67879,2021-05-06 17:38:51
"I've read multiple times from doctors and an expert that experiencing side effects (other than an allergic reaction) seconds or a few minutes after the vaccine is psychosomatic, it actually takes at least a certain amount of time for the vaccine to start doing anything. I tried to find an article to link here but when I Google vaccine side effects <5 min or vaccine side effects time frame I'm bombarded with 100,000 links discussing what to expect in the few days after vaccination, which isn't really helpful for our discussion.",n67879,2021-05-07 06:44:46

I have read that people tend to feel better after 48 hours, so, I hope you feel better soon.

All in all, it was a horrible evening but the morning came and I'm still here. Feeling so much better than I did then, and knowing I'll have a pretty good immunity built up? I'm all for it. I cant imagine how the virus feels if that is how the vaccine feels.",n6fa4y,2021-05-07 12:26:40

I had no reaction. The injection spot was sore for about a day but no worse than the flu shot.,n67f1q,2021-05-06 15:25:59
"Everyone has different body reactions to the vaccine. I've had my first shot more than a week ago and thankfully, the only stuff I experienced were the common ones like the headache that feels like I've been working on the computer for a whole day non-stop (less painful than not eating for a day), fever for 2 days, chills with cold fingers and toes, and of course, that painful injection site that feels like you smashed your arm against a pointy piece of furniture and it's all bruised up. Oh yeah, heart palpitations, too, which I used deep breathing to make myself breathe slower.

What I remember is that if you have severe allergic reactions to anything, you should check with your doctor first. This is why when you go to the vaccination site, you'll be asked to stay for 15 to 30 minutes so that if you get horrible reactions of any kind, you can be treated right away.

Also, it's a good idea to drink lots of water or juice a few days before getting your first shot. You'll have to keep hydrating yourself until you get over the horrible side effects.

Right now, I'm on my 11th day after that first shot. On the 9th day, a red lump of hard flesh appeared on the injection site and it was itchy more than it was painful. I just tapped it with my finger to make the itchiness go away. Never scratch it to avoid damage. Today, the thing disappeared thankfully. It's very strange though, how that little red itchy lump just decided to appear more than a week after the first shot, only to unceremoniously disappear today.

Anyway, getting a vaccine is a personal choice. If you're not sure if it's safe for you to get the vaccine, ask your doctor first because they'll probably have a better idea if something in the vaccine could harm your body instead of help it.

If you ever get the vaccine, I hope you won't suffer as much. Good luck!",n67f1q,2021-05-06 15:54:37
"I am nervous too but I will still do it. There is no way that any side effect of a mRNA vaccine could be more worse than the actual virus.

I get my shot in 2 hours.",n67f1q,2021-05-06 15:04:17
"That’s a shame. I just got my second dose a few hours ago and I feel fine. The nurse who gave me the shot begged me to ask friends and family to get the second dose because so many people weren’t showing up because of hearing so many horror stories. The people who feel fine aren’t saying anything, so the stories of those with adverse effects stand out. I’m so happy to be vaccinated. I’m an eternal pessimist but not about this.

"Please ask doctors yourself and do not rely on strangers advices here. This is crucial. 
When I talked to the doctor before getting my first shot last week I was worried because I was planning on stop taking birth control pill before the second shot and she told me that is no problem but IF I was pregnant by then they would not give me the shot because there is no research on it and it’s unethical to „try“ it and hope for the best. 
That’s for here, Germany. 
But one of my friends in North Carolina got her shot when she was in the last trimester because then the baby is almost fully developed and it can’t cause as much harm anymore than in the beginning of a pregnancy. 

Nevertheless I am no doctor either. Please get a personal advice. 
And would be nice to find out what you did. 
And: congratulations !! 🥰",n65au2,2021-05-06 14:17:56

"Thank you for your response :). So my fertility specialist told me she doesn’t advise it cause the lack research. But then the doctors at the obgyn said yes to get it. I know every doctor is different but crap haha. I thought “ well I got pregnant with the first shot in my system, what harm can the second one do “. My friend in NY said her doctor has his patients wait till their second trimester to get the vaccine. But my thought is, say I wait to get the second shot,  do I have to get the first one all over again cause it was well after 28 days ? Blaaa I don’t know what to do haha I got 3 hours to decide",n65au2,2021-05-06 14:23:36

I was just reading a bunch of threads and comments on YouTube videos and a lot of women got it done and were fine but then you have the others that don’t want to get it cause the risk of MC.  Maybe I’ll just hold off. Cause say I get it and I have another loss, I’m gonna blame the shot (even if it wasn’t the cause )",n65au2,2021-05-06 14:42:04
"Here in Germany (not sure if it’s the same for the whole EU) we get the second mRNA shot after 6 weeks! They extended it so more people can have their first dose! 6 weeks is no problem at all. 
You could wait and have a test for antibodies which I think u might have to pay for yourself but I would do it! It there are some then maybe I can imagine one shot will do. If not any then the doctor will decide and u may get two. 
I personally think if I was pregnant now and only one doctor would say no to the dose I wouldn’t to it. It’s a risk. But of course getting COVID is also a risk. I don’t know there’s no research and a doctor can help you figure out benefit vs risks.",n65au2,2021-05-06 14:42:59

When in doubt, ask a doctor to look at you. Follow the guidelines in the form they should of given you.

It sounds like you're overthinking it which is just creating anxiety. I'd be more worried about what ever actual natural remedies there are that you are using. There's alot of scam products in that market. Regardless of whatever article you read on the internet, the FDA is no joke when it comes to protecting americans.

On the other hand though, if you are indeed experiencing symptoms you are worried about, you should contact your doctor immediately. Don't put off any potential life threatening symptoms. It could very well be connected, or just a coincidence.",n65h5b,2021-05-06 13:46:18

I looked up both of these things and don't seem to have any of the symptoms associated with them, but I do really appreciate your concern. 

To me it feels like an inner ear issue, like maybe some lingering fluid that came about as a result of an inflammatory response. From what I can see online it looks like it can occur after viral infections (or possibly after responses to pseudo infections, like this vaccine) and usually goes away on its own even if it takes a few weeks. I'll be sure to go to the doctor if it gets any worse or I feel any pain though.",n5zdkk,2021-05-07 03:28:58
"Because feeling dizzy and fatigued is better than being dead or on a ventilator. So far I'm only experiencing uncomfortable symptoms later than most people, not anything that seems life-threatening.

I have alcohol and marijuana intolerance because of lack of enzyme. Basically can’t filter toxic substances through liver. It’s common for Asian. But Asian has high tolerance for caffeine and I had never felt sick with caffeine like this.

"Love seeing these mild stories! My second shot is Friday, so I've been a bit anxious.

I had very light effects from the first one. Sore arm, but not nearly as sore as when I got my Twinrix shot. I could move it, lift it, lay on it. I was only a little more tired than normal. My husband got it worse. Throbbing, couldn't lift it even shoulder high, fatigued.

So I'm hoping neither of us is too bad off.",n5nd89,2021-05-05 22:51:00
I think we’re the same person! I had mostly the same symptoms and we have the same vaccination dates! Glad you’re doing well!,n5nd89,2021-05-05 20:39:29

Yup. Over a month out and the swelling is just starting to go down,n5fo4b,2021-05-05 18:41:30

My pain got away and it took I think a little more than a week. I’m all fine except that the injection area still hurts (but can move the arm normally) and feels numb. Shot is 4 weeks ago and will have the 2nd one in 2 weeks. Maybe in the other arm. But I don’t know yet I hope the arm will feel normal by then.

"No, not from you having the immune response symptoms from the vaccine.

"I would be very shocked if that’s why your dad is sick.  I think it’s just a really big coincidence.  They don’t actually use the virus in the shot, so your reaction is merely a reaction from the vaccine, not the actual virus, if that helps/makes sense?",n5la2z,2021-05-05 22:42:17
"Your reply was completely out of context as it relates to what the study was asking for, its reasons, and the intent of the information sought. Rather than look at the study and what they wanted reported *if* it happened, you posted two woo sites that are only blogs, and they used the things the study was asking be reported as outcomes.

"I just had my second dose yesterday, I drank a ton of water and pedialyte beforehand and after. Eat a light dinner, and take some Tylenol before bed. Good luck, and I hope you don’t feel too rough! Edited to add: do the windmill with your arm while you’re waiting the 15 minutes after. It definitely helped me with the soreness.",n5fbtr,2021-05-05 14:30:18

"Hydrate! Hydrate! Hydrate! It helped tons with minimizing headaches for me and helping the body recover. Have pedialite ready in case you do start feeling under the weather, you can start taking that. Prepare to have to rest, but it’s not necessary for everyone. Hopefully it’s not too bad for you. I was relatively ok except for about 4 hours that I felt under the weather but as soon as it came, it went away.",n5fbtr,2021-05-05 19:40:04
"Hey!
I wanna start this by saying I’m so happy you were able to get both ! I would advise you To not have anything planned the next day.

Prepare to be sore. You may show symptoms of covid after the second shot but that's the body's response to building the antibodies. I started feeling sick on day 3 after the second shot. You may be lucky and not get anything more than the body aches.  I recommend drinking a lot of water and Gatorade now to prevent it from happening,n5fbtr,2021-05-05 14:13:50
"I had #2 about 24 hours ago. Was prepared for the worst, but so far, so good. Arm is sore, felt a little off, but if I hadn’t known what to look for I’m not sure I’d notice (other than the arm).

Yup! Mine hit 4 weeks after my first shot and lasted around 3 weeks. It hit all of a sudden and then lifted but those 3 weeks were rough.

If your stiffness is coming from the muscles, keep them warm, maybe carefully stretch and try to relax. If its worse than my advice would help you with, take some ibuprofeine, that’s totally ok to do.

"I am pretty sure I had covid in March 2020 (I didn’t qualify for testing because I hadn’t traveled out of state). I had a severe reaction to the first shot: daily/nightly migraines for 3.5 weeks. 

Just as I was coming out of the migraines I had my second shot. About 12 hours later I began to feel chills and body aches. My arm was already sore at the injection site but that’s nothing. The next 24 hours were really, really rough. Definitely reminded me of my probable-covid last year. The body aches and chills made it nearly impossible to get comfortable enough to sleep. I was tossing and turning most of the night and sweated through my clothes and sheets. In the morning I threw up and began to shake. All day I felt dreadfully tired and whenever the Tylenol wore off the chills came back within the hour. I struggled to stay hydrated even though I really did try my best. My headaches came back but only in a mild form. 

About me: female, 36 years old, currently pregnant with my second, mostly healthy under normal circumstances. 

My husband was in a similar situation. He never showed symptoms of probable-covid back in 2020 but we were both exposed to the same source and we were sleeping together normally until my symptoms broke, so our theory is he probably has asymptomatic covid back then. From our first shot he had 6 days of migraines then got better. From our second shot he had the same timeline of body aches, chills, sweats, etc. as I did. He never threw up but he did notice his tongue swelled up. He’s also 36 and mostly healthy although he carries extra weight. 

After 24 hours our symptoms began to clear. We’re both left exhausted (we got our second shot Saturday afternoon and I’m writing this very early Tuesday morning, essentially the middle of the night). Husband is pretty much back to normal other than exhaustion, but I still have very little appetite and generally feel “off”. 

Overall I’d still rather have the vaccine side effects then the virus itself, if only from a public health perspective, but that month of migraines was extremely rough.",n4e9a7,2021-05-04 09:16:49
"It was just as bad, but for a shorter period of time. I actually think I felt worse the 2nd time, even though I made sure to stray hydrated leading up too the shot and took Tylenol right after it. The only thing that was better was the arm soreness. My arm stopped hurting after 3 days, rather than a week.",n4e9a7,2021-05-04 11:57:49
"Don't know if I had Covid but first Moderna shot kicked my ass.  Fever, chills, pain at the injection site, really bad fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite...for about 3 days.

Second dose....felt mild fatigue for about 4 hours, slight discomfort at the injection site...and that was it.  Second dose for me was no big deal at all.",n4e9a7,2021-05-04 14:06:47

"Got my 2nd dose on May 4th at 615pm. It’s been a full 24 hours now. First night was uneventful. Woke up at 630am feeling fatigue and husband said I felt warm.  I didn’t check my temp. 9am rolls around, I started developing body aches. By 1pm the aches were getting worse, checked my temp it was at 100.5. I went to sleep for a few hours, and just woke up. Temp is at 101.4 now with body aches and chills, joint pain and headache.

Edit: 37F. Also have armpit pain and swelling on the side of injection.",n4e9a7,2021-05-06 02:24:40

"Thank you for sharing your experience! I just ordered some hydration packets to prep myself and my husband for our second dose in the next couple weeks, as I saw another post a few days ago mention them. My husband is not a fan of water, <insert just the slightest of eye rolls here> so I figured this would help him out a lot. I had the Moderna arm hit me on Friday, day 9, too, super swollen and itchy, and I felt like my upper body had a sunburn. Did you get your second shot in the other arm?",n43ywl,2021-05-04 03:10:45
"I just drank Gatorade Zero and I don't know if it helped or not, but being properly hydrated never hurt anyone! I'm trying to keep up the water habit even now.

I got the second shot in the same arm (my non-dominant one). My arm was VERY sore for the first couple of days and still pretty sore until about four days out after the first shot. I didn't want to risk my dominant arm being that sore for that long. The soreness went away a little more quickly this time, though.",n43ywl,2021-05-04 03:25:25
"Yea I generally keep up pretty well with my water drinking, but I figured it’d be good to have a bit of an extra boost, and if my husband likes the flavor, he might keep it up. 

I got my first one in my dominant arm, ugh, not my best idea, but it was because we went to a drive through clinic, so it was just easier at the time. Now I know better, so I’ll probably just get out of the car a bit and get it on the other side. Don’t want my lefty getting jealous!",n43ywl,2021-05-04 05:01:22

"I had my first shot a week and a half ago, and got my period a week early, which is really unusual for me. It came on the same day I woke up to my arm swelling, on Friday, and it was fairly heavy, which is normal, but no cramping, also somewhat normal. Then it seemed to have stopped yesterday. I'd only had it like 4 days, and I'm a full 7-day cycle kinda gal. My arm was finally back to normal this morning, and then BAM!, period came back full force mid-morning, and then the cramping happened for a solid couple of hours, but I'm fine now. I'm wondering if this is going to throw my app through a loop, trying to estimate when it's coming next time LOL.",n49692,2021-05-04 03:35:47
"Had my first shot April 16th. Started spotting 4 days later, a full week before I was so. Continued to spot continuously until today and haven’t actually had a proper period. Very odd.

Edit: 2 hours after I made this post my for real period started. Horribly so. Oof. Only a few days late but preceded by a week and a half of spotting.",n49692,2021-05-04 05:44:24
"I had my menstrual April 20, 8 days after my first Moderna shot and then got my menstrual again May 1. Very unusual for me",n49692,2021-05-04 06:12:01
Yes! My period came 4 days early after having my first dose.,n49692,2021-05-04 15:26:02
Mine went on as usual with worse cramping but normal scheduling. I had other symptoms like high fever and stuff. You could be fine but definitely take it easy! I hope it’s ok next month. Wishing you good health!,n49692,2021-05-04 15:59:59
Yes! After both doses I got my period. I don’t get a period because of my BC (depo shot) so was very surprised (and unhappy!) about this unwelcome surprise lol. Both were about a week after the shot,n49692,2021-05-04 23:12:09
"Hi! 
Thank you for the way you worded this question! Mine re-started after my first dose (was just wrapping up, then after the vaccine started up again) and is being kinda weird and spotty after my second, which is semi-ordinary for me but still probably impacted by vaccine.",n49692,2021-05-04 00:38:07

"Hi! So I have not noticed a delay after either shots. All of my periods have been on time (Flo app lol). Ironically, I was scheduled to get them the day after each shot and I did get them both times. The first one post second shot started on time. Now the length/heaviness, I kinda can’t tell if the shot has made them shorter/lighter or if its my age (31). With that said, you might be okay! Time will tell. Try to relax. I know a lot this can be nerve wracking. Remember, stress can screw with our periods too. I know it does for me lol.",n49692,2021-05-03 23:50:48
"30f - no impact that I could tell from either shot.  (Moderna)  My period was maybe a day or two early, but that's within a normal range for me.  It was heavy, but again, that's normal for a cycle where I've had a lot of sugar or not exercised a ton.",n49692,2021-05-04 00:45:41

First day I had a slight headache but today it feels like it’s getting worse all other symptoms I had have subsided and the stomach ache went away completely.,n4ci2w,2021-05-05 15:08:22
I had 12 days of migraines that started the day after the shot. Now I wake up with one but at least it will go away the rest of the day now. My lymph nodes are swollen one of my ears are clogged. I've had tinnitus the whole time. I regret getting the vaccine when my head hurts but when it doesn't I am like ok it's only temporary. It's been the worst. I was a recovering migraine sufferer before the shot so these symptoms were very disheartening,n4ci2w,2021-05-06 00:27:58
"I had the same reaction after my second, got it 5 days ago and about 10 min after the shot my throat felt numb.  I then got shaky and hot and felt like it was hard to breathe but assumed i was having a panic attack (I’m not allergic to anything to my knowledge) so I took xanax and eventually it subsided.  Over the next few days I would get the throat tightness and difficulty swallowing.  I’ve been taking benadryl which seems to take care of the anxiety over having a possible allergic reaction.  I think it must be from tensing my jaw.  Idk I’ve been searching the sub for this particular effect.  Don’t have any answers but I am going thru the same! I never feel this sort of tension in the front of my throat even when anxious",n43u75,2021-05-04 03:00:31
"Hey! I also have a hard time with bad anxiety and I know that some of the symptoms of anxiety can be really intense which would cause a downward spiral.

I hope this helps! :)",n43u75,2021-05-04 07:30:17

I've never felt tension like this either which makes my health anxiety go crazy :( it's really really scary,n43u75,2021-05-04 03:34:33
"I forgot to mention, I had to schedule a routine mammogram and the drs office mentioned they don’t schedule for 4-6 weeks after vaccine due to lymph node swelling post vaccine which is normal.  So I think the tightness in throat could be due to this as well since we have a lot of glands in our neck.",n43u75,2021-05-04 04:07:12
Do you have swollen lymph nodes as well?,n43u75,2021-05-04 04:19:28

"Hi thanks for the response, after my telehealth the doctor said at the 3 week mark it was very unlikely to be related to the shot but rather that they're seeing strange viral responses from people and they theorize it's due to a taxed immune system. She diagnosed it as Pityriasasis which is a viral rash and I will be getting my second shot wedensday!",n454nb,2021-05-03 21:44:33

"I think there were several reports of tingly arms/legs with Pfizer and Moderna. Maybe call GP or 111 for reassurance, just in case?",n432g7,2021-05-03 19:42:09
I had the tingliness for 1-2 weeks before it subsided. It was mostly in my right leg that I injured before. 3 weeks since first shot and it still gets numby/weird but not tingly. My doctor screened me for stroke/blood clot so look out for swelling and bruising. Unlikely it’s a clot but I appreciated my doctor taking me seriously...,n432g7,2021-05-04 04:01:08

Today, I have cramp on my right leg (tingle/numbness)and right wrist. (I got the shot on my left arm) . I’ve seen my Dr at least three times already due to side effects, stress and anxiety from the shot but I am feeling better day by day. Hope you feel better soon too.",n432g7,2021-05-04 06:34:15

"Thank you for sharing and i hope you feel better as well! It's such a time of heightened anxiety for many at the moment. I am still optimistic it will pass and i'm still pleased i got vaccinated. I haven't gone to my doctor yet, i'm wondering if i should just so that they're aware of it for other people. I've already submitted to the yellow card system we have here in the UK.",n432g7,2021-05-04 09:56:26
"Me too. I am hopeful that this will pass. Good news is that my cramps are gone today but still have tingle on both feet at times. I am nervous , scared and sensitive for every little thing that I feel after the vaccination so that may be weighing on this too! Please go to the DR if you are worried. Hope you feel better soon!",n432g7,2021-05-04 16:23:21

"Read my post history, there is also a Facebook group about tinnitus possibly vaccine caused. For me it's believed autoimmune attack of the cranial nerves triggered by vaccine. Likely will resolve over time, but recommend a course of Prednisone. Your doctor will probably want to rule out other things, may not believe the connection either... However, I do recommend working through the symptoms asap, had I acted sooner, I think I could have kept my symptoms fewer, less severe, and would have resolved sooner. All my accompanying symptoms are gone, but it took a month and half, still have tinnitus 3 months later.",n3xyaz,2021-05-03 16:15:33

After my first shot I got a cold sore too! It was huge. I never get cold sores in the spring I knew it was the vaccine,n3w2r1,2021-05-03 15:24:52
"When it comes to cold sores any vaccine can make the virus spike in your system due to how low your immune system gets, even more if you get fevers. This happened to me with my second shot because of the high fevers and my immune system dropped super low I ended up getting 3 at once. I get them every few months due to stress, or immune system dropping. I was able to get rid of mine in a week by constantly cleaning the area putting abreva on it every few hrs and as painful as it is, rubbing alcohol. I ended up doing some research when I saw the 3 cold sore pop up at once for me and that is what I found which does make sense because I would get them with the flu vaccine also.",n3w2r1,2021-05-03 16:13:30
"I got a mild herpes outbreak with my 1st shot. Then, I got a sizable outbreak a few days after my second shot. I’ve had genital herpes for over 20 years… and it’s quite manageable with Valtrex and I rarely get breakouts anymore. But, these shots were such a shock to my system that I’m not surprised that I got a breakout with each one. Hoping that you feel better soon.",n3w2r1,2021-05-03 14:54:30
"I have a prescription called valtrex , not sure if you've ever heard of it, but it helps greatly with cold sore outbreaks, I'm just not sure if it's safe to take it 4 days after second vaccine ?",n3w2r1,2021-05-03 14:55:19
Feel better soon!,n3w2r1,2021-05-03 15:17:08
"Do you think it's safe to take valtrex days after vaccination? I have valtrex for my outbreaks, this is def the worst one I've ever had, thank God we wear masks",n3w2r1,2021-05-03 14:57:19
"Thanks for sharing that in case I ever need to go the prescription route! I’m honestly not sure either. I don’t see why not since it’s past the 24 hour threshold, but since I don’t know what’s in valtrex, I don’t want to steer you in the wrong direction. I used abreva for mine as soon as it appeared 3 days after my shot.",n3w2r1,2021-05-03 14:59:39
Thank you!! 😊,n3w2r1,2021-05-03 15:17:34
"I haven’t heard anything about not taking prescribed medications after any vaccine. Certainly if you have an outbreak or are suffering, I would say to take your Valtrex. Or if you are on daily long-term therapy I would not stop it. I took my Valtrex as soon as I realized I was getting an outbreak for the first one. But I missed my window of opportunity for my second, more sizable outbreak. But I did take my medication diligently once I realized I had an outbreak and it’s helped tremendously. Feel better soon!",n3w2r1,2021-05-03 15:00:33
I asked the person administering my vaccine if it’s save to take antivirals and he said it shouldn’t interfere with the vaccine at all. Hope this helps!,n3w2r1,2021-05-04 01:27:43
"Abreva doesn't work for me sadly.  Def mention cold sores to your doctor the next time you're getting a normal physical, he'll most likely prescribe you valtrex based on how frequent they are.  You basically take it when you feel like you're getting one & stop once it's healed.  It stops the herpes virus basically momentarily",n3w2r1,2021-05-03 15:03:47
Will do!! Thank you so much. I hope you have an easy recovery period and that your cold sore goes away quickly.,n3w2r1,2021-05-03 15:10:11
Official recommendation from the CDC states you should get it as close to 28 days as possible but up to 6 weeks (42 days) is unlikely to be a problem.,n462mc,2021-05-03 21:19:41
It’s not an issue in England they give them 11 weeks apart,n462mc,2021-05-03 21:15:35
You can get it up to 6 weeks apart per the CDC and maybe longer.  [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011e2.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011e2.htm),n462mc,2021-05-03 21:19:15

I got my 1. shot 12 days ago and haven’t felt like myself since, I am feeling a lot better today though. The first day I got a mild fever after around 14 hours, it only lasted a day, but the tiredness, muscle weakness and feeling like a would have cramps in my legs sustained up to this day, but of course much milder. I got the sore arm the same evening I got the shot, felt very fatigued(that’s what am still dealing with), tired and “brainfogd”. On day 4 after the shot my lymph nodes started growing under the vaccinated arm and in my neck. That was really painful, but after 3 days the pain disappeared. On day 7 I got the typical “COVID arm” with this rash around the injection site. That lasted 3 days. Today I feel a lot better. But I am really nerves for my 2.dose. I wish more people could tell how their 2.dose was after experience a bit more side effects then only the sore arm after the 1. dose. Nor have I had covid as far as i know.",n3toiz,2021-05-03 20:20:18
"My best advice is to hydrate, hydrate and hydrate some more before and after the 2nd dose.  I honestly think the Tylenol BEFORE the second shot helped.  They say not to, but I don’t believe that it affects it all that much with regards to efficacy.  I also took Tylenol at regular intervals whether I thought I needed it or not for a whole 24 hours.  I wish you luck on your 2nd dose!!",n3toiz,2021-05-04 21:05:20

He was fine, just sore in the arm. Sunday morning he lost his sleep to extreme abdominal pain and vomit, high fever, and has been like this for the second day.

He's now fine and happy he got his shots early and never caught covid. He still wears a mask to work though. Also my husband and I had over 101 degree fevers and low back pain and we are in our early 60's (61&62). However no one in our family (cousins, in-laws) over the age of 62 got a fever.

OP - I broke out sometime after my first shot (in March) but I didn't connect the dots until a month later. They look like red pimples but it's more of an allergic reaction. I went to my dermatologist (they were kind of stumped until I told them my theory which was the vaccine which is the only thing that's been new in my life) and I called Moderna in TX to document my side effect. It's all over my chest with some on my neck (and now stomach) and a few appear on my arms but then go away.,n3nwnd,2021-05-03 14:23:56

Terrible headache, nauseous, overwhelmingly tired, fever, etc. She was so nervous to get the second dose but interestingly had very little side effects. She believes that she actually had Covid late last year and from what we’ve been told, that may be the reason she had such a rough reaction to that first vaccine.

Hey I mean CDC does recommend not to take the second dose if you still have not recovered from the first dose on the day of ur second dose. They highly recommend not to. I think your having a severe allergic reaction. It’s only concerning because you experienced these symptoms unusually longer than other people.

"I (26f) had the virus in June. My first shot was kinda like my reaction to the real virus, I had a fever, tired, weak, diarrhea. But for me, with the real virus, I had those symptoms for a WEEK instead of 1-2 days. With the real virus I also had coughing, nausea, vomiting, constant diarrhea for that week too. I didn't get a negative test for a month until I got a rapid test. The virus was WAY worse. Take your vaccine reaction and multiply it by 100 haha. I had my second shot Friday and I had a pretty sore arm, and I am tired, but that's pretty much it. Be grateful you only have a bad reaction for a few days to the vaccine and not struggling for a week being severly sick(maybe dying) and a month trying to get back to normalcy.

ETA: my husband might have had it, but never tested positive, only had a fever for one night. His reaction to this vaccine is WAY worse than mine for the second dose. He had severe chills and then a pretty high fever all day yesterday, if that helps. I don't think it correlates. The re virus is actively attacking and replicating in your cells, the vaccine reaction is just your bodies initial reaction to a few pieces of the genetic code.",n39ofn,2021-05-02 17:53:59

Then the first Moderna shot. Feverish and tired, a little diarrhea. That's it. 

But the second shot? Starting that night, the same things as above that I experienced with the virus itself...  but MUCH more intense.... PLUS uncontrollable shakes and chills, high fever, my skin felt like it was on fire, the bottoms of my feet were in so much pain I was literally whimpering for hours, my entire abdominal area was in real pain, my left underarm lymph nodes became swollen, and I had insatiable thirst.  Again, very weird.",n39ofn,2021-05-02 23:14:49

"I had major anxiety as well but it really wasn't that bad. I did feel a little shitty the next day after the shot but just rested all day, and felt 100% fine the following day. The shitty feeling was not memorable in any way, just felt like I was mildly ill. And now I feel so much better knowing that I'm better protected against the virus!",n3khm6,2021-05-03 19:55:41
"Can definitely relate, the closer I get to my appointment the more I want to skip it. My 2nd dose is on Saturday, my symptoms from the first dose was extreme arm pain and some sleepiness (I also had a panic attack). Doesn’t help that I keep looking for negative vaccine news to fuel my anxiety.",n3khm6,2021-05-04 07:32:45
"You’ll be fine. It’s not so bad that you wish you didn’t get it.  .  if you feel anything which you may not,  Advil will make it way better.  I hesitated to take it not knowing if I could and once I did I felt so much better it’s not unbearable and you will feel better after about 12 hrs. 24 hrs you’ll forget you even had it. Reading about it on the internet makes you more anxious because you’ll see mostly the negative stories.  Just expect to not feel great, achy and tired nothing you can’t handle. It beats being in the ICU with covid .. my worst fear/nightmare scenario.",n3khm6,2021-05-05 07:02:03

Yea I def didn’t drink water on my first one I’ll try that thank you !,n3khm6,2021-05-03 02:45:09
I keep thinking it’ll be better then double thinking it. I’m glad you’re ok 💕,n3khm6,2021-05-03 02:46:39
I’m a hyperchondriac as well after my first dose I had chills which I normally never had I thought it was me panicking during the following days I thought I was dying it’s so embarrassing but I don’t wanna go through that anxiety again,n3khm6,2021-05-03 03:03:57

May 9 th at11 dreading it,n3khm6,2021-05-03 02:47:05
I can definitely relate. I’ve gone to the ER before over anxiety thinking I was having a heart attack. For me it was helpful to remind myself that any reaction was just the vaccine doing it’s job and completely normal. Do your best to keep your mind off of it and try to stay positive. And it doesn’t last too long!,n3khm6,2021-05-03 03:26:37

"Yes! 10 days after shot 1 I felt that morning sickness feeling—off and on very subtle for the next 4 days. 46 F, not pregnant, not hung over😊",n3s3wy,2021-05-03 16:40:30
Thank you. That makes me a little worried as I was feeling fine like normal yesterday. Nausea is the worst..,n3s3wy,2021-05-03 14:36:27

Damn but is it gone now? Are you totally back to normal?,n3s3wy,2021-05-03 19:03:58
The nausea subsided last night after drinking ginger ale. However the headache 🤯 and fatigue are still bad. Are you feeling any better?,n3s3wy,2021-05-04 20:58:06
Yes...ready for round 2!❤️,n3s3wy,2021-05-03 19:04:43
"I read that ginger is helpful and didn’t think ginger ale would too, that’s great!!
I had it only for that day. The next day (yesterday) was fine again. I usually don’t take any OTC drugs or anything before I slept a night over my aches and in 99% of the cases this helps. :)

But last night my inner armpit startet hurting really bad and it still does. I read that lymph nodes might swell but they’re not swollen they just hurt really bad :( it makes me worried. Today is day 6 after the vaccine (4/29). 
How did you do ?",n3s3wy,2021-05-05 14:13:45
Thank you. Let us know how it went! When is it ?,n3s3wy,2021-05-03 19:06:26
That’s so interesting but I also heard it’s common for that to happen. I hope the swelling goes down for you. Last night was the first night I slept for most of it. Even had trouble waking up this am. I could have slept longer. Mild body aches and my head is still pounding so bad. Tylenol and Motrin don’t seem to be cutting it. Not sure what else to try.,n3s3wy,2021-05-05 20:27:23
Will do 5/13,n3s3wy,2021-05-03 23:46:01
"My son suffers from bad migraines (he takes Eletriptan & Topamax) but doesn't have seizures.  He was tested numerous times with EEG's as a baby as he was premature and the neurologist was concerned with his development but nothing ever turned up and he's in his 20's now. I was worried he would get a bad migraine after his 2nd Moderna shot but he didn't get one, he only had a high fever and some low back pain, nothing too bad. I think he was taking some Tylenol for the fever. I guess he got lucky. 

My neighbor's 16 y.o. son does have seizures and I'm worried that that young man might have seizures from the vaccine. I guess I'll find out if he has more seizures after he gets vaccinated if his doctor recommends vaccination. Good luck to you hope you are feeling much better soon.",n3k2jp,2021-05-03 04:21:29
Had no seizures at all. It’s not the vaccine itself that can cause seizures but the fever soy may get with it that can cause seizures. There are meds for that but even fever does now have to be there. I am not afraid of the second dose,n3k2jp,2021-05-04 10:42:41

Has it improved? I’m worried this will affect me at work tomorrow.,n3gkpq,2021-05-03 03:39:28
The first time I had it a couple days. I thought it was from something else until I got it after the second shot. After the second shot it lasted two weeks of being a daily thing. Now it’s been almost 4 weeks and I just rarely get a second or two of it super quick. So yes it improved but took time.,n3gkpq,2021-05-03 03:44:37

"My arm was so sore after dose one I couldn’t move it. Just got my second dose yesterday. I read online that right after your shot (within 15 min) move your arm in a wheel motion, and continue to do light arm exercises every hour (you can look this up and it’ll show you the kind of exercises to do). My arm is still sore today, but I think it’s a little better than last time, still hurts but more mobile",n39yyv,2021-05-03 01:36:47

From my experience heat helped better with the soreness. The second shot is going to be more of the same. Just keep an eye on your temp and take some tylenol and ibuprofen alternating. I was ok after day 2,n39yyv,2021-05-02 17:28:33
Lots of Gatorade!!!,n39yyv,2021-05-02 18:27:38

"My arm was painful 2-3 days after, then was just mildly sore and much more manageable for a few days after (fully healed after a week). I had covid back in March and got my first dose in April, so my reaction to the first dose felt very similar to when I had covid - luckily a relatively mild case, just had a headache, low-grade fever, fatigue, some mild aches/chills, and just generally feeling run-down and out of it (+ arm soreness from the shot).

Just a sore arm and some fatigue on the day after I took the 2nd dose. 24h later I ran a 10k and haven’t felt anything since then!,n2okgh,2021-05-02 05:44:36

"It was the hottest day of the year here so far when we got our second dose on Thursday 4/29. Arm a LOT more sore than 1st dose which was barely sore. Had a rough first night where I woke up every hour because my heart rate was jacked up to 85. Drank Pedialyte throughout the night. It was 80 degrees in the house and I didn’t have the AC on overnight which was stupid. Next morning I felt run down and had a slight fever, but it never got past 99.6 the whole time. Had chills for about an hour around 10:30am. Put on a sweater and got under blankets and it passed. No body aches, headache, or nausea. Took a Tylenol and then finally turned the AC on around 3pm (25hrs after second vaccine) and immediately felt better and have felt back to normal ever since. Arm barely sore now. 

Keep your house cool on the day/night you get the vaccine!! I think my experience would have been more mild if I did.",n2okgh,2021-05-02 08:55:08

Mine is similar.  Felt bad for a few hours on day 2. Chills.  Fever.  Dehydration symptoms. Lil dizzy. Went to bed and fine the next day. Arm mildly sore to touch. 1st shot my arm soreness was worse.,n2okgh,2021-05-02 22:02:26
Ugh. I had zero reaction to both shots.,n2okgh,2021-05-03 18:20:54
Yeah I’ve seen lots of “my arm was sore for 48 hours and then I was fine” type stories here. I noticed them because I am envious! Happy for others that they are doing well but the first shot kicked my ass and I’m just hoping the second isn’t so severe on me (got it 4 hours ago).,n2okgh,2021-05-01 22:54:00

"I believe I did, in early March 2020. I didn’t qualify for a test because I hadn’t traveled outside of my state, but I have reason to believe I had it. I’ve read that people who’ve had covid tend to have a stronger reaction to the first shot so I’m guessing that’s the case here.",n2okgh,2021-05-01 23:00:49

"I'll add a bit more here in the comments...
I received my second shot Thursday morning. Tonight I noticed slight itchiness and when I went to scratch it I realized it was also warm to the touch and there's a slightly swollen area at injection site. The rash also hurts/aches when slightly pressed.",n330uc,2021-05-02 10:43:48
"I had the exact same thing after my second dose too! Like, literally looked exactly the same, was itchy, swollen, and a little tender. I drew a line around the swollen red area with a marker to make sure it didn’t get any bigger and then it slowly went away over the next 3-4 days.",n330uc,2021-05-02 12:07:07
That’s what happened with the first dose for me. The second was much milder and barely itched,n330uc,2021-05-02 13:33:43
That happened to me as well after first dose. CDC is says it’s covid arm. My doctor told me to take Benadryl and Tylenol for pain. I see some people taking Advil for pain as well. Mine is finally gone after a week.,n330uc,2021-05-02 17:06:38
"I'm so sorry you had this too but I am so relieved to see that others have experienced this! I knew getting a rash was a thing but I'd always read that it was usually the first shot and that it generally showed up a week or more after getting the shot. It made me nervous that it was the second shot and only two days after I'd gotten it. I was worried I was having some sort of allergic reaction. I've never had a reaction to a vaccine but I do have seasonal allergies and have had random breakouts of hives that have been chalked up to contact with some sort of cleaner residue left on surfaces etc. 
I also consulted my mom who is a nurse and she confirmed that it is an unfortunate, but common, symptom. She told me to ice it and just keep an eye on it. She said it's only an issue if anything begins to drain from the injection site as that would indicate a possible infection of some sort. 
I am interested to see if there is information released in the future as more is learned and discovered as to why some get a rash and some do not. It's fascinating to me.",n330uc,2021-05-02 15:37:04
"Yeah, me too. I got my second dose the 17th. My guess at least in my case is that it's unrelated and I picked up a bug.",n2vg1b,2021-05-02 02:28:18
Mine didn’t start until the 2 week mark either so it’s probably just a delayed reaction to the dose.,n2vg1b,2021-05-02 05:51:49

I definitely haven’t felt 100% since my 2nd dose and it will be 2 weeks tomorrow. I developed a swollen lymph node on my neck today and was hit with a wave of fatigue/stomach pain. I’m getting a COVID test tomorrow just to be check my bases, but I assume it’s either vaccine or some other virus.",n2vg1b,2021-05-02 07:10:23

"Totally went through it...more with shot #2 than the first. For me, it was related to a crazy increase in stomach acid, which is what gives you hunger pains.

"Yes! I was so hungry after my first shot a 4 days ago. Had the shot Thursday went to bed, woke up at 3am because i was so hungry, went back to sleep, woke up 3 hours later ravenous again, back to sleep then had lunch and this continued for a couple of days. I'm not usually a big eater and to actually wake myself up to eat is dedicated! As side effects go i wasn't mad about it.",n2umdk,2021-05-03 20:09:06
Yes. I’m a person with a large appetite usually. My friend and I both got our first Moderna vaccine and both of us have had intense and unusual food cravings.,n2umdk,2021-05-05 02:06:57
"My reaction has been the opposite. I haven't felt hungry at all since the first shot (3/4). Like I eat because I need to eat or I know I'm going to get sick or pass out, not because I'm feeling particularly hungry. And that feeling of wow I'm starving or I'm getting hangry is non-existent.",n2umdk,2021-05-02 19:35:55

I did kind of feel the same way a couple days after. Seem like it only lasted a week or so for me. All I can figure it was just  something with your immune system being so amped up.,n2q20c,2021-05-02 03:50:52
"Wow what an experience, I'm very glad to hear that you're feeling great after the vaccine!! I completely understand the part where you mentioned people having polarizing views on the vaccine. I shared my experience openly on youtube but saw there were quite controversial statements going on in the comment section already. I'll just say that if you're comfortable sharing with close friends or those who support your decision, find support there. And for those who don't, they have their views to uphold and in the end we can only hope through reason and by listening, education, and open sharing we can come to mutual understanding and have more vaccinations! 

Oh also here's the link to my video if you're interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1\_BEDBb3WBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_BEDBb3WBk)",n2q20c,2021-05-02 07:26:43
"Yeah, I actually had something vaguely similar, but I chalked it up to maybe having had long Covid and the vaccine seemed to improve my experience? Like, a week after the vaccine, I remember using an exercise bike and having so much energy that I managed to do 75 minutes at 13-16 MPH when before I was struggling with my breathing at the 30 minute mark. That only lasted about a week at that level and following that I felt better than prior to the vaccine but probably could only get to 55 minutes at 11-13 MPH. 

I felt extremely run down right before and during my period and had some bad experiences with that that may have been vaccine related and haven’t quite gotten that “superpower” level of energy back yet.",n2q20c,2021-05-02 18:52:50
Loved the video! Great editing,n2q20c,2021-05-02 19:49:02
That’s interesting because the pizza king mentioned something similar above. I’m at my almost 2 week mark so hoping the feeling lasts! I also get better sleep but that might be because I am running more. My period came earlier but cramps were less (I get heavy ones usually) but this was a little bit lighter.,n2q20c,2021-05-02 19:51:29

"Had my second dose of Moderna yesterday afternoon, felt fine last night; bit or soreness and a slight headache. But I woke up at 3 am super nauseous and threw up (hadn’t been drinking or eating anything weird), and then the strangest thing happened afterwards — my teeth started chattering like I was in the Arctic. And then my whole body started shivering. And I had to really concentrate to stop the chattering and shaking. This morning I have a headache, body soreness and some lingering nausea. My nurse advised trying to ride it out without OTC or other drugs to allow my body’s immunoresponse to do it’s thing, but I kinda wish I could.

He was sick and I knew it but didn't really care, he wasn't coughing, just said he didn't feel right.  I said yep, you probably have covid.

2 weeks later, I still don't have covid.  Natural immunity going 7 months strong.  The beauty is being around him probably strengthened my antibody response.  This is why lockdowns, quarantine, masks and all the rest is bullshit, it's counterproductive.",n2df3e,2021-05-02 02:36:13

"Im not a scientist by any means, but from my understanding, mRNA degrades very rapidly, whether its in a vaccine or not. It degrades so rapidly, that if a tiny droplet were to be put on a counter-top at normal temperatures, it is completely gone within 1 minute. (hence the need for mRNA vaccines to be shipped ultra-frozen, & even then, only having a short shelf-life in refrigeration after being defrosted). Our bodies are extremely efficient at breaking mRNA down & discarding it. Most reputable sources say that the vaccine mRNA is broken down & discarded by our immune system within 48 hours or so. After that, it is actually our adaptive immunity thats kicking in to study & ""remember"" it, in case it ever encounters it again. The adaptive immunity is what takes a couple weeks, even after the mRNA is gone, while your body builds long term immunity via t-cells. Adaptive immunity (long term) is like a stored rolodex of every crazy thing your immune system has ever encountered in your entire life, so it can quickly refer back, find & destroy invaders, should it ever encounter them again. Of course each persons immunity could be different, but from what ive read, long term immunity is typically completed after a few weeks? Thats why some people dont feel a thing but arm soreness, others feel crummy for a day, & others take a week or so to fully bounce back. Again, im no scientist. I just read up on it from reputable trusted sources, & tried to steer away from any wacky sources that were not credible. And of course im always willing to learn more, if any scientists read this & want to teach us!",n2df3e,2021-05-01 18:23:27

My only advice from my experience is to prepare your home environment just in case you are one of the rare folks who suffers more difficult side effects: have a stockpile of clean laundry ready, dishes done, some easy meals prepared, lots of Gatorade on hand. Then you’ll be prepared.",n2df3e,2021-05-01 19:03:27

"Yeah but getting covid can kill you and your close ones if u don’t notice fast enough. You won’t die from the vaccine so what’s the risk ? 

You don’t know if you would have a bad covid, right. You also don’t Know if u will have as Bad side effects as many here are reporting. 

I just think if you’re sick after the vaccine you know where it comes from and that it will be good a few days or let it be weeks in the absolute worst case (very unlikely!).
If you have covid and eventually have a bad covid I would have even more panic that it might get worse ..",n2df3e,2021-05-02 07:52:23

Did the windmill with my arm like an idiot while sitting in the pharmacy during the 15 minute waiting period directly after receiving the shot 😂 i think that really helped with the arm soreness as it does not hurt this time around. I started feeling kind of run down by 10 pm, had trouble sleeping due to anxiety about waking up and not feeling well, which is pretty much what happened. I woke up at 4 am restless and very hot with a low grade fever. I drank some more pedialyte and rested on my couch for a few hours. Around 11 am I felt hungry so I ate a light breakfast and took some Tylenol. I took a shower and since then I’m pretty much almost back to normal.

"What are you talking about? Of course vaccines can have side effects. Aspirin can have side effects. I’m NOT saying anything untrue. I am saying that NO other vaccine makes people so universally unwell and we say it’s good. We would not be giving them to infants if they were having blood clots, fevers of 103, and vomiting on such a grand scale. Those vaccines are effective. Why does this one cause so much trauma? 
Yes- anything you put in your body has the potential to have side effects to certain people, but that is not at all what I’m asking here.",n2df3e,2021-05-01 14:07:22
"I understand your perspective. I’m not anti vax by any means, and I’m actually disheartened that I have not had a smooth experience with it. With that being said, I still think people need to make informed decisions. At the end of the day, they have to live with the choice they’ve made. If the long lasting effects present a new normal that is debilitating, I can’t in good faith tell anyone to choose that. We all know that covid is a killer and can leave you debilitated as well. People need to weigh out the risks in both scenarios.",n2df3e,2021-05-01 19:10:40
A lot of places aren’t giving you a choice. Your comment doesn’t negate anything I said. I feel sorry for the people in India. That doesn’t change the fact that several people are apprehensive about the vaccines due to not knowing the long term effects and hearing about people’s unfortunate experiences.,n2df3e,2021-05-10 02:33:05
"Not quite sure if you saw my other comment to this poster, but I’ve expressed that people need to weigh out the risks to them. I encourage anyone to do that with anything medical and to do it using reputable sources and doctors they can trust. 

Yes, covid is extremely dangerous. I am not anti vax, so I don’t need convincing; however, people have a right to be concerned either way. Death is not the absolute factor here. No seemingly healthy person wants to have neurological issues post vaccination. I am speaking from experience, and I am praying that it will eventually pass. You can easily find others in similar scenarios. 

Do the research, weigh out the pros and cons (that’s what I did and took the vaccine!), and make the decision that works for you. I stand by that sentiment.",n2df3e,2021-05-02 14:43:16

"Yeah I feel bad for complaining about my side effects experience, because I DO truly believe the vaccine is a good and necessary thing and I don’t want to deter anyone from getting it. Maybe I’ll delete my complaining comment. I believe I had covid in early March 2020 and it scared the hell out of me—and I was lucky. I definitely think taking a gamble with vaccine side effects is way better than gambling with the effects covid-19 can have on you.",n2df3e,2021-05-01 18:56:19
"It is good that you are reporting adverse effects, considering the survival rate is as follows ''The **survival** **rate** for kids aged 0-17  is 100%; it is 99.8% for adults aged 18-64, 95.1% for adults aged 65-84,  and 84.2% for adults aged 85 and older. The **COVID** **survival** **rate** had been as high as 98.9% in early November before KDHE ‘reconciled’ death certificates and added deaths to prior months.''

It is a hard pass for me, and I am immune compromised, but everyone that I know that has taken the second dose is suffering to this day. One girl I know has a messed up menstrual cycle, she thinks it's the jab. Considering the stats, and considering Moderna admitted it designed this vaccine in just two days before it was pushed out the door, yeah, I think I will wait. I will wait at least until FDA approval, and also wait until there is a producer of the vaccine that is not protected by the government against liability.",n2df3e,2021-05-01 20:28:31
"I was reading an article stating the FDA will never approve this because of liability reasons. Basically they are afraid of litigation from injured parties due to adverse effects, so this will just continue to be used under emergency use, or under phase 3 clinical trials without actual approval.

But dont hesitate to reach out to your Dr if youre concerned... Its just my opinion (which means nothing lol) but i cant see scientists & doctors (who have devoted their entire lives to something they passionately believe in) intentionally harming people if something wasnt safe, you know?

It almost happened to me but the nurse saw this coming and lied me down. I lied down from the beginning for the second shot and was ok. It’s not dangerous but it’s subjectively really unpleasant and scary.,n2jap5,2021-05-01 22:32:55
"It could be the vaccine, or could be a vasovagal response that some people occasionally have with shots.  I fainted when I got the h1n1 flu shot back in the day. It can be scary and disorienting. But it's not necessarily a cause for alarm.",n2jap5,2021-05-01 16:02:07

"I was light headed and almost fainted after the first, it did not happen with the second. I got all hot and sweaty and my heart rate went up a little. It only lasted a few minutes and then went away.  I stayed seated the whole time but let the nurse know. If I had stood up I probably would have fallen over or at least stumbled. They walked me to sit somewhere quiet and away from everyone and I was fine. *edit: I'm 31**

By the way, I had the SAME reaction to the first Prevnar vaccine a few years back. I never react to the flu shot. It's not a question of this vaccine in particular but is a reaction some people have to new vaccines. At least that's what my doctor has said. 

IMO, this vaccine is pretty safe. Not saying this to change your mind or try to sway you. But to try and provide a new perspective. Just because it's a new pandemic doesn't mean that this virus (even this variant!) is new to scientists. There is an entire field of science that studies all the viruses and learns about in them just in case they create a pandemic.... oh wait.....

They've been watching Covid and it's variants for years so they have a pretty good idea about what they're up against and how to develop safe vaccines. This isn't something they just pulled out of their ass last minute. They just manufactured it really fast. People talk about failed vaccines from the past but I don't think they remember in that moment how far technology and medicine has come since then. They wouldn't be vaccinating THIS many people if it it were THAT dangerous. 

Either way, statistically not that many people get covid compared to the general population. So the precautions we took last year have helped for sure. But those that do get infected can become really sick. Or stay healthy and then pass it to someone else who may not be so lucky and have an unfortunate end. In my case I wanted the vaccine fully because the risk of getting covid isn't worth it to me. 


Ultimately this is a big step for you to make a decision for your best interest! No matter what you choose, you're making the RIGHT decision for yourself. It's wonderful that you're reaching out to get different perspectives and comfort. Keep asking questions and follow your instinct!!",n2jap5,2021-05-17 12:50:26

I hadn't eaten anything all day and was nervous about the needle, so hopefully that's all it was, but now I am very nervous to get the second one.

"Totally understandable, even if they had signs up though (which Walgreens did not) we still would not have known to tell them. Because he has never ever fainted prior to this occasion. I think it was a combo of blood pressure and being anxious maybe",n2jap5,2021-05-02 10:50:18

About 2 weeks. I sent pics of my tongue to my dentist (not as weird as that sounds) and she confirmed. She called in RX mouthwash but it resolved before I started on it. I’ve now had shot 2 and no thrush recurrence.,n2l08t,2021-05-01 22:28:41
"Sure! I drink 72oz of water everyday, but I will definitely start drinking more to see if that helps

All good! Turns out it was from Flonase allergy inhaler. Apparently a common side effect!,n2l08t,2021-05-04 02:06:49
"Same with me. After my first dose I basically had a 24 hour flu with a 100.6F fever, chills, slight headache, body aches and fatigue. Haven’t felt that sick in years. I asked my doctor about it and he said he had a similar reaction and not to worry about the second dose as the benefits obviously outweigh any side effects.",n2knbo,2021-05-03 02:14:44
I’d say within the hour you’re ok. I would hold off on drinks though. Reading through these experiences it seems to make things a little more rough.,n2kijo,2021-05-01 16:50:40
"For me, the sore arm wasn't the issue because I could still move it and use it. Moving it and keeping active actually helped. My concern would be (1) your risk if the axe-throwing is indoors, since you're not fully vaccinated until 2 weeks post-2nd dose and (2) your overall physical well-being after the 2nd dose. I wouldn't want those side effects to suddenly hit me when I was away from home.",n2kijo,2021-05-01 19:33:49
"If you had fever like symptoms with your first shot you most likely have covid before. Your second shot shouldn't be too bad.

I'd hold off on alcohol, arm soreness for me started after 2 hours but manageable. Probably wouldn't want to throw axes with it though lol.",n2kijo,2021-05-01 19:21:25
"Good point, i’ll hold off the drinking for that weekend",n2kijo,2021-05-01 17:09:18
Thanks i’ll keep those in mind! Had the same worries,n2kijo,2021-05-01 20:42:49
"They were mild and i think everyone i talked to had similar symptoms as me, i wasn’t sick, just seemed a normal reaction to any vaccine, I also live with someone who tested negative for antibodies so it’s likely i didn’t have it, although there is still that possibility.. thanks for the input!",n2kijo,2021-05-01 20:44:12
"I don't think it's correct to say if you had a fever from the first shot, you most likely had covid. If it is, I'd love to see a link corroborating that.",n2kijo,2021-05-02 14:12:23

But by day 2 I had extreme fatigue, really hot skin to the touch, chills, mild fever, headache, and increased heart rate. I’m still not 100% but I feel as though I may be nearing the end of my side effects. I have been drinking lots of water as well, and when I did try and have some coffee it made me feel awful so I have ditched it until I’m feeling better.

"Thanks for posting,  today is day 8 past my 2nd shot and I've had a low grade fever, aches/pains and headache most of the day. Basically,  the same way I felt days 1 and 2 after each shot. I was wondering if anyone else had side effects come back this late. Feeling better now so I hope I'm past it.",n23y84,2021-04-30 22:50:53
"After my first shot about a week in I had fatigue and the blahs for 12 days. Tried to power through it with wrk and working out. My wife made me take a depression survey online. I didn’t think I was depressed, and it said yes. But I answered most of my answers around tired and not wanting to do things. The 12th day my brain kicked on and I felt amazing. I was also sleeping 7-8 hours a day and taking naps. I had my second shot 25 hours in right now. I’m exhausted and feel fatigued. I hope I don’t have another 12 days of feeling like a zombie.",n23y84,2021-04-30 23:12:14

"I felt fine after second Moderna shot. Not even a sore arm. Five days later? I was covered in hives. Up all night scratching. My doctor says take Zyrtec and Benadryl, but so far no relief. Going into my third night of what I expect to be zero sleep. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",n23y84,2021-05-01 01:26:56
"I just had my first shot on Wednesday afternoon. By midnight I was already feeling feverish, and by the morning my whole body hurt, was extremely fatigued, my temperature was above 101, this progressed to 102.4. My normal temperature is a high 96, low 97 so pretty big change but still within normal healthy range for a low-grade fever. Fever starts at 100.4, above 104 is when there should be concerned and you should go to the ER. I was hungry but hardly had any energy to make food. It was a whole process. After I did get some food in me and slept more, by the afternoon I was feeling a bit better, still had a fever and then a viscous headache started. Finally slept more and woke up in the evening feeling better but still had a fever. Finally, my mom was able to stop by with some Tylenol which helped break the fever. The next morning, Friday, I woke up feeling pretty much fine. Mentally clear, not super tired, had a fully functional day, felt fine. This morning, Saturday, my lymph nodes are really sore under my arm in the arm I got the shot in and my temp is a high 99. But, as previously mentioned these are all good signs that my immune system is on alert and working to protect me. Also, so much more compassion and empathy for those who have actually had Covid, and grateful to the scientists who worked so hard to create this. Thanks for sharing your experiences! Super helpful 🙏",n23y84,2021-05-01 14:52:42
"Thanks for posting this. I have been searching for others who have had ongoing side effects. I have had ringing in my ears ever since I received the second shot. It has not let up and I had my second dose April 7th. Oddly enough, my husband mentioned this to my mother in law and she has also had ringing in her ears as well.",n23y84,2021-05-02 03:34:27
No.,n23y84,2021-05-01 09:41:38
Had a bad chest cold about a week and a half after the second dose. It has lingered a bit after a bad four initial days. I'm still coughing stuff up.,n23y84,2021-05-01 10:04:14
"You're not alone, which I think is important to know and the reason I posted--was concerned that people might be afraid to get the shots so I thought about it a bit.  

As mentioned, everyone's body manages the vaccine in their own unique way.   My two friends were at both my first/second shot.  We all got hit that initial 24 hours after the second shot but I'm the only one of three that got hit two weeks later.

"It's an odd experience, isn't it.   The depression thing was my very first thought, and I've not had issue with that prior.   It's important to have chat groups like these to help as I couldn't find a thing that told me that others felt this way or that way or two weeks later....

As my doctor said, while the impact of the vaccine may have felt strong, it's nothing compared to what the 600k+ went thru before losing their lives.  That really struck home.

Kept doing that thing you do when you come out of a pool and think you have water in your ear. Didn’t hurt, just felt strange as I hadn't felt it in years.

I had a mild reaction to the first dose. Aches and chills for a day. I was also really worried about the second since most don’t react to the first. I’m now about 36 hours post second shot. Worse aches and chills for the fist 24 hrs and I’m tired this morning but feel better.  Hoping I’m through the worst of it and I definitely built it up to be worse than it is.,n2h4y3,2021-05-01 14:24:25
"Just updating this to say that it's been a little over 60 hours from the first dose and I've been feeling pretty awful. I'm battling a decent fibromyalgia flare for sure, and some extreme gas trapped in the side I received the shot in. Honestly it feels as though I'm dealing with kidney stones again or something because the pain is that awful. (But yet it's not located in my flank. The pain is in my pelvis and feels better momentarily when gas is released.) My arm is still very sore. And I am exhausted.",n2h4y3,2021-05-03 08:27:45

"venous thrombosis, and blood clotting is a very prominent side effect of the mRNA jab, if you have constant aches with headaches accompanying any of these symptoms check yourself in. It is very important you watch for that, including aneurysms which can arise quite quickly.

Drink a lot of water and try to not stress out (like me). Get rest if you need to and listen to your body. Side effects mean you’re immune system is acting like it’s supposed to and the vax is working!,n2cwf2,2021-05-01 08:22:19

"Listen to your GUT! This IS totally unethical to require you to be experimental guinea pigs.

🚨Hundreds of thousands if not millions of women from all over the world reporting that the vaccine has caused them to stop having periods, or vaginal hemmoraging with ultra heavy bleeding and clots for weeks or months on end, thousands of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, miscarriages, and even many cases of premature menopause (women in their 30s). Many women rushed to the hospital over loss of blood. Also a huge percentage if women report the vaccine has caused anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, brain fog and lethargy, inability to focus and more. 

Experts say that the vaccines mess with Women’s reproductive system and cause their uterine lining to shed so it can no longer hold a fetus. And Of course once you get the experimental vaccine, you can’t just “return” it or take it back. Causing women to become infertile appears to be a side effect. If you have any adverse side effects from the vaccine you are not allowed to sue the vax companies or pursue any legal recourse. Wake up, folks! Don’t throw your life away when you have a perfectly great immune system and even if you do happen to get Covid, it’ll just be a cold and you’ll have a 99.98% recovery rate. You’ll regret it.",n2cwf2,2021-05-03 04:38:19

"I have a chronic migraine condition and am SUPER sensitive to everything. I’m also first to get a flu shot each year. I decided to get vaccinated because as sensitive as I am....whatever reaction I get from the shots, I’m certain my reaction to COVID would be ten times worse. My first shot went well… And I did have a pretty strong reaction to the second shot (I got Moderna). But all of my side effects resolved and I am even more convinced now that I really needed to get that vaccination. The worry and stress I have felt this past year are lighter (not gone entirely)....and I have a kiddo and a husband who need me. I felt I owe it to them to keep myself as safe as I can. I hope this helps!!",n2ax0q,2021-05-01 05:40:16
"I have tons of skin allergies & had the same worries. I chose Moderna as in studies it had the lowest risk or one of the lowest for allergic reactions. I think J&J might be even lower risk in regards to allergies. I also have a lot of anxiety & don’t always get my flu shot either.

Anyways, I’m done with both my first and second dose, and happy to report 0 allergic reactions. I did have some side effects after the second dose, but, nothing due to allergies and they completely resolved in under 36hrs. Like the person above said, I would be more concerned with getting Covid and having it give you long term issues or being out on a respirator or having it cause death. 

I understand the anxiety/worries but I do think you will be fine & thankful you did it once it’s over.",n2ax0q,2021-05-01 06:58:10
"Having covid made me decide. Ive never been so sick, and I get the full blown flu at least once a year and have had pneumonia 2x. No skin allergy/reaction or day of flu like symptoms is worse than covid.  Just got my 2nd dose about  14 hours ago. So far just a sore arm, but we will see how I feel tomorrow.

"I honestly went with my gut. I had to really work on blocking out everyone’s opinions, as people have them and really like to voice them. I started out not wanting it as I’m pretty holistic, however I personally know someone who has passed and know of someone who was just placed on the ventilator. Just heartbreaking. I decided I wasn’t comfortable not being vaccinated and being around my loved ones. I’m in my mid 30’s and live a healthy lifestyle. I just had my first dose (Moderna) this past week, I have side effects but I can tell it’s my immune system working and I’m starting to feel better.",n2ax0q,2021-05-01 19:24:06
"I really struggled with the decision. I have severe anxiety, panic disorder, and also autoimmune diseases that could have been potentially exacerbated by the vaccine.

However, I have been quarantined for a year, afraid of getting COVID. The pandemic has really increased my anxiety and made me essentially agoraphobic. 2 relatives nearly died from COVID, and one friend with no pre-existing conditions developed a heart condition from COVID.

But finally I made a decision to get the vaccine when my roommate made his appointment. On April 1st I got the Moderna vaccine. It was what was available in my area. At first, no symptoms. Then 8 days later I got “Covid Arm.” It was as my doc described a “vigorous immune response” in my arm with a gnarly itchy rash that lasted off and on for a week. It also kicked up some autoimmune stuff for several days, and I didn’t feel well. It scared me, because I wasn’t prepared for it, but in retrospect it really wasn’t that bad. Certainly not as bad as COVID or the flu.

Just got the 2nd shot on Friday at 4pm and so far have just experienced a little bit of arm soreness, maybe a bit more fatigue than usual? Will I get a delayed reaction or was my immune system already primed? I guess I will see. I did prepare by taking high dose Vitamin D past few weeks (read it was good to and I’m supposed to for MS anyway). 

Anxiety is a beast. I think it makes sense to have anxiety right now given all that’s going on, but it’s extra difficult for those of us with anxiety disorders.

It is okay to be skeptical. It’s okay if the vaccine isn’t right for you or if this isn’t the right time. Whatever you decide, just stay safe!

I will say I got my second dose at Walgreens (if you are familiar), and I liked that I had the option of asking the pharmacist questions about the vaccine. They were very organized there, and that eased my anxiety.",n2ax0q,2021-05-02 05:52:19
"If you’re afraid of the reaction then you should be terrified of covid symptoms.  Pop some Ativan, ask dr for zofran, get the vaccines and some pho and you’ll be right as rain.

"Just wanted to chime in - I got my second Moderna shot on Wednesday morning, and ended up having a steady 103 fever from Wednesday night until Friday morning - from that point it went to a 101, then broke completely around 4 or 5 yesterday. Still have a general fogginess and ""blugh"" feeling, but fever is finally gone and so are the body aches. So for me it was almost right at 48 hours of suckiness. Tylenol definitely helped curb some of the aches, and broke the fever periodically, however it would come back with a vengeance.

Definitely a smaller price to pay than actually getting COVID, so hang in there! Make sure you keep drinking fluids, try to eat something nutritious if you can, and stay strong!",n26gz7,2021-05-01 16:01:44

This morning, though, I woke up with a smallish sore/swollen/itchy spot a bit lower than where I got the shot, and now it's gotten bigger, like half my upper arm, to the point where it feels like it did the two days after I got the shot, like I worked out that muscle or something. I'm feeling flushed, but I usually get pretty warm, and flush badly, so maybe it's me just thinking about it too much. I reported it the VAERS site earlier when it was just a small area, I'm wondering if I should report again that it's gotten a lot bigger, and mention the period thing..

"TMI warning but yeah. Mine was the reverse of most of these. My first shot (which unlike most reports was the worst of the two for me), I had a horrid cycle that month. I’m usually pretty predictable give or take a day, this one was on time and then came down like lightning right on time 2 weeks after my shot. The pain was ungodly and the bleeding was thin with no clotting, which was puzzling because why the pain? I would sit and bleed into the toilet like I was peeing. I went to the GYN and they did an ultrasound. I’ve been getting them due to a polyp in my uterus they’ve been monitoring. Well that was gone, my uterine lining was super thin, which is actually a good thing, and my uterus had shrunk (I have adenomyosis so that’s good, too). The bad news was I had a rather sizable fibroid in the wall of my uterus that wasn’t there in September. That would explain the pain and the bleeding for me. It is unknown what causes those, but they can resolve on their own. 
This month after my second shot, my period was actually lighter than usual, and the cramps lasted more days but not as bad. I did go through a crap ton of ibuprofen, but I think it will all balance out and go back to normal. Heck maybe I’ll even get to keep some benefit. From what I’ve been reading, there is a lot of immune tissue in the uterus that helps us to both not reject fetal tissue and also helps to eliminate old endometrial lining monthly. I suppose it makes sense then that the lady parts are temporarily acting up in some people for a bit? Honestly if it weren’t for the other reports, I wouldn’t have even made the connection, because who ever thinks that their period is connected to anything but their age, birth control, lack their of or pregnancy? I mean the only other thing I can think of is insulin resistance and hormone imbalance due to weight fluctuations. Alas, interesting stuff.
Edited to add, I also had uncharacteristically bad PMS, crying and depressed. It was super annoying. That was only the second shot though.",n1trs1,2021-04-30 22:01:36
"FTR, I have been a heavy bleeder for all 28 years of my menstruation history. I have a 21-25 day cycle.

I had my 1st moderna shot on April 11. The injected arm started getting sore 2 days later while feeling overall muscle soreness, very tired, dizzy and off balance. 2 days after that those symptoms were lessened but felt more winded than normal after my routine daily 1 hour brisk walks.

My period did not arrive earlier than (my) normal. But my pms was especially brutal this time. Not so much with cramps which I prepare for with regular doses of Aleve but just being so tired and feeling so drained of serotonin. My other arm (not the injected arm) has been feeling extra sore along with my back and neck area. Not sure if that is because my left arm had to pick up the slack from my other injected arm being sore for several days.

I have not even had my 2nd shot yet.

Edit: Forgot to mention that my overall bleeding is significantly less this cycle in my experience.",n1trs1,2021-05-01 01:49:17

Got my second dose a week ago now and I am 2 days late, which for myself is not normal. I am use to extremely heavy periods so I am not fully concerned about that but wondering if it is even gonna come this month. I know with our bodies our cycles can definitely get messed up by a basic cold, stress, lack of sleep and there is so much more. With my second dose I did end up having high fevers and chills that took me out for 2 days so that can definitely affect my period. I know in the past when I was extremely sick this happened with my period too. But I am very curious to know why it in fact does cause issues.",n1trs1,2021-05-01 20:22:15

I got my first shot right in the middle of my period. Then I didn’t get my next period for 2 months. I had really bad breast pain probably 1 week after my second shot for a good week to ten days. I would think that I was possibly pregnant except my partner has a vasectomy and I’m 47. My age can kind of be a part of the long time between periods but honestly this is the first time it’s ever been this long.

I was quite shocked to get my period this morning, although I am really glad I did because it explains a lot and my boobs feel normal again.  Some people claim for women it could be from stress with getting the shot.  Well, I had zero stress going into this, but was sick from the shot for about 2+ weeks.  I felt some stress about that, but I truly think there is something in it that is fucking with our menstrual cycles!",n1trs1,2021-04-30 14:39:53

"For sure. I even looked it up when I heard so many people were getting period issues, and one article said it could simply be stress. I don't think this vaccine is stressing our bodies out enough to mess up our periods, it usually takes a good deal more for that to happen (at least in my case). I do hope it's just a one-off and doesn't mean that something in the reproductive system is getting messed with. My next period is supposed to be on 5 May, so I'll definitely come back and update.

I hope yours evens back out very quickly, the two week difference there would give me some worry there, especially if you're generally like clockwork with your cycle.",n1trs1,2021-04-30 17:34:07
"Don’t get me wrong, it was straight to the doctor with me because the first month was like straight up labor pain. That being said, neither he nor I made the connection to my recent vaccine, and I had even mentioned it when they called for the screening, but only because I was experiencing Covid arm and what I now know to be a likely fixed drug eruption at the time (per the dermatologist, oops, I guess I should have gone to the doctor about those marks after all...) and I didn’t know if it would affect the scan or my appointment. They said I’d be fine. My point being, no one ever seems to look at exterior factors with gynecological issues, myself included so I’m not pointing fingers here as far as that goes. I mean, who would think to add on V-safe, “my cramps were hell this month compared to normal”, I mean, come on!! No wonder they aren’t getting reports. I’m all about the science and the data, but there is a bit of a data bias here.",n1trs1,2021-04-30 22:29:29

What saved me after the second shot was [this towel](https://www.amazon.com/Frogg-Toggs-Chilly-Cooling-Yellow/dp/B002JAPDRO/) cut into a wide strip, wrapped around my arm, paper clipped in place and keep it wet.

Dang dude... 

My best advice to you is to accept that the vomit will happen, and to drink enough water to make the process as painless as possible. It will keep your throat from becoming acidic and destroyed as fast, and stop that terrible dilemma of ""body wants to hurl but there's nothing left."" The water is not bad at all. Also, light soup for the day before and the day of. Eat crackers if you start throwing up, as they will make you want to drink more. You want to dilute your stomach acid as much as you can.

"Get your second shot. 

Right now you're only at about 80%, and the 2nd shot will get you to 95%. We're all going to need to do everything in our power to avoid catching the variants.

If you catch Covid or any of the variants, you actually *could* feel like this for the rest of your life. The long-term effects can be serious. But the vaccine won't make you feel like this forever -- the side effects won't last long.

Talk to the person vaccinating you about the effects, and stock up on Tylenol. Drink lots of water both before and after the shot, and try to get enough rest over the next few weeks. Alternate heating pads and ice on your sore back and joints, and take a hot bath if you have a bathtub.

You'll get through this. It's worth it to avoid actual Covid.",n1l281,2021-04-30 08:46:56

Everybody here strongly advised the second shot but if you even express a little hesitancy on getting the vaccine they're like,  ""are you a doctor""... honestly, take the shot if you want and get your second dose and you are 95%protected. Leave people alone or at least don't hate if they are expressing valid medical concerns about getting the second shot because it may be quite serious for them. Blanket statements and medical advice should not be coming from anybody but your doctor when it comes to getting your second or first dose. If you are 95%protected, laughter at the skeptics and knowing you are going to survive should be good enough. Just my anxiety and panic disorder is going to be enough to destroy my quality of life if I get any needle stick in my arm, you might as well put me under because I will never be able to rationalize a jab of anything.

From what I've heard pushing the date from 28 days to like 30 or so is not an issue at all. So if you wanted to make it for after the wedding that might work better just in case.,n1qjwh,2021-04-30 15:42:13

"I got my second vaccine 42 hours ago. 24 hours after my arm was too sore to move. 42 hours in I just have light arm soreness and I'm very tired. Been hydrating heavily, and using cannabis for the soreness, although I haven't used cannabis in around 18 hours. 

That said, everybody is different. I'm a wildly out of shape man about your age, and I feel fine. Some people, in much better shape than I am, seem to struggle a lot more. I would say that if you can rest and relax after getting the shot, that would be best. Perhaps see if you can get the shot a day earlier. I know that 24 hours after my shot, running around and doing wedding stuff would've been difficult.",n1qjwh,2021-04-30 11:44:28
"The last statistic I read was that about 50% of people had a pronounced reaction to the second shot (fever, body aches, etc) that lasted 24-48 hours, and the rest had mild or no reaction. But there is no way to predict how it will go and how you reacted to the first shot isn't much of a guide. 

If it were me, I'd reschedule the second shot for after the wedding. There is so much last minute logistics that have to be worked out the day or two before a wedding, potential mini-crises of things not going as planned, and it can be exhausting under the best circumstances. You also want to enjoy your wedding and it won't be much fun if you start feeling really fatigued. A couple days should not interfere with your timeline for trying to conceive.",n1qjwh,2021-04-30 18:37:26

"From a different thread of mine!

For anyone following I wanted to provide an update.  I am now 27 days after second Moderna dose.  38F, white, no previous history of headaches or migraines.  I have been experiencing a migraine since the second dose on 4/2.

I have been managing the pain with Tylenol and 600mg of ibuprofen throughout the day.  Benadryl and melatonin at night to sleep more than 5 hours. Headache moves around the head, no singular spot and no consistency other than the felling of pressure.  Sometimes throbbing and I can feel my pulse in my head.  Pain level fluctuates between a 4-9, light and sound sensitive.  My PCP did give propranolol which is a preventative that takes 2-3 weeks to kick in.  I have been taking 40mg 12 hours apart twice daily.

I saw a neurologist on Tuesday and came out with information and options but no real solution.  Being that this is my first experience with headaches and how far in I am not a lot that can be done other than manage the pain and hope that this is a one time thing.  He did say that there have been cases they are aware of where the vaccine triggered a very long migraine for some.  So, you are all validated.  The cognitive issues I am having with memory recall is normal given the amount of pain.  He recommended a course of IV drugs at the ER to knock it out and to check in in 4-6 weeks, keep a headache diary.

Last night I went to the ER to do the IV drugs.  I didn’t take any OTC meds to get a baseline and it was a 10 pain level after waiting to be seen for 2 hours.  They gave the following.  Toradol, Benadryl, and Reglan.  That knocked it to a 5.  Then they added Haldol and magnesium and that knocked it down to a 1.  They released me and I slept like a baby last night.  

This morning I feel much better pain is a 2.  Pressure but no light/sound sensitivity and for the first time I feel ok to drive in 3 weeks.  For those of you managing with self care, I would recommend a combination of magnesium and Riboflaven(B2).  Neurologist recommended to keep at bay long term.  I will update in a week, hopefully this is the end of it!",n11qeo,2021-04-29 13:46:00

Have you been getting enough salt and potassium? My husband and I got through it with liquid IV drink mix.

"See a doctor and don't let them tell you it's nothing.  In the least, see if they can give you some migraine medication.  I have been reading that there are people who have developed shingles post shot and there have been many who have rheumatoid arthritis that flares even though they've been in remission for years.  Maybe neither of these applies to you but you shouldn't be continuing to have headaches.

I agree that our medical system is messed up; doctors often are fed the same rhetoric we are and become the biggest and most influential pushers of information that isn't fully accurate or helpful; and then, they don't treat you like an individual which is precisely what they should be doing.  

I just had my second shot yesterday and I'm so messed up (55 and very healthy).  I didn't have a good time with the first shot.

"I have had 3 solid weeks of migraines (now plus a few days) since I got my first Moderna shot on April 3rd. I’ve seen my OB and my neurologist about it.

Mixed results from seeing doctors. My OB was concerned and compassionate and prescribed a migraine medication that’s considered safe for pregnancy (I’m in my second trimester). My neurologist, an older white male, started off saying, “I don’t know anything about prescribing medications during pregnancy,” and proceeded to rail against it for my entire visit, saying I should only take Tylenol because that’s the only drug that’s proven safe, that prescription drugs can’t go through clinical trials for preggos because it’s unethical so nothing is on the table, that I should space out the medication doses as far as I can (I am), that it’s a vaccine side effect and I just need to wait it out, and does my OB know what she’s doing because he’s afraid of giving drugs to preggos. Which for most of this subreddit isn’t a concern probably, I’m just sharing my experience. And for the record I consulted TWO different OBs on this medication’s safety, I have been spreading out my doses as much as I can, and I’m using other methods to control the pain like cold compresses. I’m not just popping pills for fun here. 

My post-vaccine symptom has mainly been these throbbing headaches of varying intensity located behind and above my right eye. The throbbing gets worse with movement, including going from sitting to standing; light, which is a classic migraine symptom; noise, also classic; and when I sneeze or cough or even fart, it hurts more. When controlling my pain with Tylenol only, before getting the prescription medication, my pain would wake me up in the middle of the night when the dose wore off. 

I have had 7-8 migraines in the past (I’m 36 years old) but never like these. They come and go and are unending. Past migraines would last 4-6 hours and then they’d be over with. 

I’m planning to still get my second shot on May 1st as scheduled but I’m nervous as hell. The migraines are possibly starting to taper off the last 3 days (I’m afraid of jinxing myself) and I’m afraid the second shot will bring them back. However, I’ve also heard of the covid vaccines lifting the covid symptoms that long-haulers are suffering so maybe the shot will help me? I know it’s not the same but I’m grasping at straws here. 

My primary OB said that she’s seen, in general, people who have severe side effects from the first shot have an easy time with the second shot. My neurologist said it’s basically a coin flip. 

My neurologist also said that he’s seen post-vaccine headaches go for 6 weeks, in the case of one of his office workers. 

I honestly don’t know how I’ll get through it if that happens to me. I asked the OB nurse if they could put me in a medically induced coma if that happens. Having severe headaches every day and night for weeks has really messed with my sanity.",n11qeo,2021-04-29 19:45:56
"My original comment was all about me and didn’t address your question directly, OP, so I wanted to remedy that. I agree with you on being reluctant to seek medical care because it’s so common to be brushed off on these things, especially because it’s a new virus and new vaccine so there truly is a lot of missing information and experience that doctors can bring to the situation. Also there’s the American medical care system in general and the fact that women’s pain tends to be downplayed. 

Plus, it sucks to make the effort to drive yourself to the doctor when you’re in pain, just to be told to take some Tylenol and stay hydrated, which is a very likely outcome in my opinion. 

A compromise: do you have a relationship with a doctor, ideally a GP or OB, who has a patient portal set up? If so, you could send them a message for free, letting them know of your symptoms and asking if they feel it warrants a physical visit and if they have any advice for you. 

When I did this, on Day 5 of my post-vaccine migraines, my GP wrote back that it’s a common vaccine side effect and to feel free to make an appointment to be seen in the office if it gets worse. I found his response a little dismissive and I had the OB appointment on the books anyway so I went that route instead, but it did save me a visit to the GP while still getting his initial opinion.",n11qeo,2021-04-29 19:53:18
"This has happened to me too and I'm on month 3.  Start w whatever MD you are comfortable with if it does not go away soon.  You are right, that the medical system is tough tho.",n11qeo,2021-04-29 13:02:20
"CDC says the *average* length of vaccine side effects is about 3 days. That tells me many people still have symptoms almost a week after the shot. But if you are seriously concerned, see a doctor.",n11qeo,2021-04-29 14:27:52

"I also got my 2nd shot on Monday 4/26 ( you can check my history for my post ) 

Anyways I had the same reaction as you . But today I’m so much better , almost at 100%, just some back pain left . But I also had 48 hours off from work and just rested and yesterday only worked half day and got a lot of rest . 
Resting helps the healing process too. 

I know for many it isn’t an option to take so much time off from work , but working can cause side effects to linger longer . 

I’m no doctor but I know a few things . 
Drinking Electrolytes really helps the recovery. May I suggest Ultima Replenisher ( you can google where to buy , I buy online at thrive market but you have to be a member to order from thrive . No worries plenty of other places to buy , just don’t use Amazon , too many fake products on the site ) 
I like the grape flavor . I drank 4 cups a day . On a daily base I drink I cup a day 

I don’t know your diet , but I do know carbs and sugar cause inflammation to the body . Inflammation in your body will cause headaches as well as other aches . Anyways if you can keep your carbs very low and stay away from any type of sugar …… yes that includes high sugar fruits , then you should get rid of the headaches.

Btw during the last 3 days I had headaches too (which I never get ) 
I didn’t have much of an appetite since I got my second dose so I only had chicken broth . 

Then a pear sounded very appealing to me . ( this was 24 hours after the shot ) 
I haven’t had a pear since I went to keto lifestyle ( almost 2 years now ) 
Anyways as soon as I finished the pear ( fruit that is high in sugar , even though it is natural sugar ) my headache got so much worst. It was like someone was pounding on my head . 

Just reminded me why I keep a keto lifestyle. 

Hope this helps , and hope you feel better soon.

Edit to say you can buy Ultima Replenisher directly from their website.

Told the pharmacist yesterday, and she said I was the second person to have had that.  The other person had the J&J shot though and their diarrhea lasted for a few weeks.

I have endometriosis, i'm underweight, also very severe health anxiety, also very sensitive to caffeine. When I went to get my first dose I was literally shaking and had a breakdown during the 15 minute wait after. I can say with confidence now, that the worst part of it was my own anxiety. I had a very mildly sore arm and that was it. I know not everyone has the same experience, but the likelihood is that you will be fine. 

I actually told the nurse when I got there that I was having extreme anxiety and she really helped calm me down. Don't be afraid to vocalize what you are going through to them- they want you to feel as comfortable as possible.",n1b7t5,2021-04-29 23:57:24

I just got my second one today. I was nervous after hearing about side effects. So far just some arm soreness. What makes me feel better is thinking about how much worse COVID might be if I didn’t get vaccinated. Plus I want to feel safer doing things again.

Other than that, try to not take any pain relievers but it’s absolutely fine if you get bothering symptoms you do. I’d say avoid alcohol and caffeine, and block things out for the next day. I had electrolyte water and chicken noodle soup on hand with Netflix queued up. Just make sure you stay hydrated and you’ll be good!

None of them have experienced it though.",n17v9l,2021-04-30 05:44:23
Yeah! I’ve heard people have been getting the rashes. I have a reddish area as well that almost feels like a bump?

Just to update him and let him know what’s going on I’m sure he’ll tell you what you can do and if you should be concerned. I sent my doctor pics and he told me to put a cool towel on it every hour for 10 minutes so I’ve been doing that. He said there’s a chance it’ll get bigger, It looks slightly bigger since it started about 24 hours ago. I feel fine otherwise just tired.

"I'm getting my second shot in an hour, but I will say that my allergies have been worse than usual this year and I wonder if the first shot had something to do with that. I would say it took until about Week 3 after first shot for me to feel truly, 100% back to normal (physically and emotionally; my anxiety and depression flared up and I don't know if that's also related or not). 

I run a 5k about once a week and the rest of the week do various HIIT workouts. I didn't have problems like you're describing, but I also didn't feel like I was fully firing on all cylinders until the third week. I guess we'll see how #2 goes!",n0wqa1,2021-04-29 15:51:19
"I had my second moderna shot on 4/27.  51m good shape play regular basketball.  Played several days after and felt great.  

Played a week after and had severe shortness of breath.  Hoped it was a one time thing. Played this morning, about 2 weeks after second shot, same problem.  Hoping it will settle down like the original 5k runner poster.",n0wqa1,2021-05-08 13:29:24

Don’t take the second shot. It will get your deeply depressed if you got this reaction on the first one.,n0soku,2021-04-29 03:45:56
Yes.  Seems to have seriously ramped up my anxiety.  I did have it prior to vaccines but it is out of control now.,n0soku,2021-04-29 01:24:33

Shit ... hahaha. Again. Same RE no crying - I'll keep you posted after my second dose. My one hesitation in getting the vax was brain chemical affects. Ugh. Be well. RARRRRRRRRRD 🤣🤪,n0soku,2021-04-29 23:58:04
Yeah no PLEASE get the second shot. If anything you prob5 just have extreme anxiety about this whole thing. This is kinda most people's first pandemic and the whole world shut down..normal to have anxiety getting the vaccine over everything that has happened so far,n0soku,2021-04-29 04:21:41
"**Do not skip the second shot.** My second shot put me in incredible misery physically and mentally for 48 hours....and I regret absolutely nothing because after another week I'll be vaccinated completely and that's what matters. I've got depression also; of course feeling like crap for two days will make you more depressed, but I can't think of anything that's more worth it.",n0soku,2021-04-29 05:31:25
Don’t miss your second shot. Anyone who has taken allergy shots can attests to this. If you miss your shots your allergies come back and you either have to restart the regiment or find a new allergy medicine. This goes for any multi-dose medicine in general (MMR and the flu shot come to mind as major shots). Missing your second dose (or subsequent dose) also gives room for “surviving” pathogens to mutate to become immune to the medicine requiring new medicine to fight the superbug.,n0soku,2021-04-29 11:22:41
"I'd just beg for people to make sweeping generalizations. My fear was the mental affects. But reality is- this is our reality. I couldn't not get this- if I wanted to see my dad, my only family member and BFF for the first time in a year. 2 days of misery but now I feel like a champion. The first did make me mentally-emotionally affected- second...after the 2 day coma...couldn't be more grateful.",n0soku,2021-05-28 20:21:55

"Yes NSAID’s really help with the side effects. I was holding off from taking anything ( I don’t really like taking meds ) and boy was it brutal. ( my first shot was no problem. It’s this second shot ) I couldn’t sleep for almost 2 days . Ended up taking Advil PM , after an hour I felt so much better and was finally able to sleep .",n0svy3,2021-04-29 05:13:24

"Chiming in about the OCD. it can be activated if you are experiencing levels of general stress that isn’t necessarily connected to the physical response of the vaccine.  I had some side effects during the first dose including a panic attack. But, the second dose was fine, everyone is different. What helped tremendously during the second dose was staying super hydrated and super distracted. Dont let your mind focus on the fact that you’re getting vaccinated. Wear headphones during the injection and then afterwards during the waiting period, call a friend or listen to a Podcast. Keeping ur mind focused will prevent you fainting or triggering anxiety or OCD",n0sxkl,2021-04-29 01:54:08

I’ve been trying to do some research on this but not finding much. And of course there is no long term data about the moderna side effects. I hope this goes away soon because it’s not good.",mztvj5,2021-04-28 01:17:02

"Okay, thank you.  
I sincerely hope she starts to feel better.  I think so many of us just went into this with such hope!The trial runs of the vaccines were not enough for us to know how people would react to these shots and SO MANY people are having such wild and awful experiences.  It has truly made me rethink getting my kids vaccinated when the opportunity arises.",mztvj5,2021-04-29 02:32:08

So, he hasn’t been safe with our kids on his time.  I was very hopeful about getting them vaccinated and not worrying so much about things.  But, I don’t want to put them through this, it’s too risky.  Especially when I read stories like your wife’s!

Sat down next to the garbage and puked my guts out. Luckily my partner was there to help me back upstairs. Felt fine afterwards.",n02oi9,2021-04-29 00:50:32

"Wow, so interesting that you would get so cold!  I'm glad you're doing well!",mzrgyv,2021-04-27 19:20:29
"Wow, I could’ve wrote this. Same boat. I had my first vaccine on the 23rd, and I’ve had a pretty bad headache since. I’m already prone to migraines though. I’ve had pressure, mainly on my nose bridge and inner eyebrows as well as a headache in the same place since. I also feel foggy and kind of out of it, which I attribute to being from the pain (I feel the same when I get migraines). 

For me, this is day 5 and I’m starting to feel a little better...I think? I still feel like crap. Pain killers aren’t working, but pressure point massage is giving temporary relief.  A cold rag, though cliché, is also helping take the edge off.

ETA my pressure is mostly right side but a bit on the left, so opposite of you but similar still. I’m not anti vaccine at all (obviously, since I got it) but I’m really not looking forward to the next dose 😭 I’ll have to mentally prepare to be out of commission for a week.",mzube2,2021-04-27 19:28:06
"It’s strange, I go to sleep hoping I feel less foggy the next day and to my disappointment it’s just a slight difference. I’m hoping with time I go back to normal because it’s hard to ignore I feel like I have short term memory or something I just can’t think straight like this. I’ve seen some other posts about this kind of side effect so I’m really hoping that with time this side effect will wear off. Not sure how long to give it before I seek some care/if I should seek care for this.",mzube2,2021-04-28 00:52:09

"I wanna say with time it’ll get better since I’m feeling a bit better than last week. I randomly get that same feeling sometimes or just where I feel dizzy for a few minutes. I’ve realized I feel much better when I keep up with my vitamins and take some magnesium to help with the tension headaches before bed. I’ve also tried to take some qunol turmeric for inflammation, not sure if that’s what is helping but it makes me feel not as bad. I’m trying to take vitamins my body may be lacking. I think it’ll be a slow process but will definitely be better in a few weeks. I think we may also be getting in our heads too so I try to take deep breaths and try not to get overly anxious!

Saturday morning I woke up with a rash size of a softball, hot to the touch, and itchy non stop. No fever no other symptoms. Come to find out CDC is calling it “covid arm” and to call where you had the first shot. 

I did call yesterday. The doctor told me 80% of patients got covid arm first dose and was fine the 2nd dose including herself. Just continue taking Benadryl for itching and Tylenol for pain should be gone in a few days then will return in a week.",mzpz4i,2021-04-27 15:58:23

"This is a great question. 

I got my Moderna second vaccine on 02/27/21 and I feel a lot better today. 

Jan and Feb were difficult months when I received the vaccine, I was very concerned about joint pain and headaches that were 9/10 pain. I don’t have any underlying conditions besides an IUD. Today, the joint pain is 90% resolved and have “flare ups” when I am stressed or over working once a month. 

Overall, mid March is when I started to feel “normal” again and will continue to monitor any conditions that come up.",mzck2x,2021-04-27 04:57:33

Foggy brain 
Trouble concentrating

"I’m 28 F, BMI 25, t2 diabetic, no other conditions. Pretty healthy. Had covid in January pretty mild, sucked. I was the first wave of adults to get vaccinated with pre existing conditions and got my first dose feb 6th amd second March 6th! 

It was ROUGH. I had fevers both times, I was out 36 hours both times. But then like a Florida storm I was immediately better and sunny and back at it- I feel great. Honestly better than before I had it, maybe it’s relief; maybe it’s because I’ve been going outside more to exercise haha. 

But I saw my vaccinated parents and hugged them for my graduation last week. 

10/10 would do it again. I don’t care how sick I got. Covid was awful, and I had a mild case. 

Hope you’re doing well! And I promise as bad as it may seem for other symptoms for the vaccine you’ll probably do just fine.

Everything seemed ok when I got it, but that night I had nausea where I threw up twice, chills, headache and odd jaw pain. The next day my teeth ached like never before. It was sporadic that tooth than this tooth. Then just my crowns then my gums felt weird and rough. I was like what is going on! I went to the dentist my teeth on x ray looked healthy. I think the shot did something to my submandibular gland and my parotid gland and causes inflammation or something. It was so strange! It lasted for 2 weeks!!!! I could only eat soft foods. It finally calmed down with no antibiotics.",mzck2x,2021-04-27 18:51:37

I had my second shot April 1st and have had joint pain/inflammation for some time, but I also have an autoimmune disease, though I do believe the vaccinations have kicked up my immune response quite a bit.

"@ Arawak-man22- Glad to hear you are feeling better. 
Hope the rest of your recovery goes well . 
Thanks for sharing your experience. 

I truly believe because we feel fine and we go to work instead of staying home and relaxing is why the fatigue starts to set in , cause we feel we have to go to work or do stuff if we are feeling even a little better or don’t have high fever . 

The fatigue is telling the body - hey you need to rest....... but for many of us just taking days off from work isn’t an option . 🤷‍♀️

Now I’m 13 hours after my shot . 
My arm is very sore and so is the rest of my body. It feels like a truck ran over me . 
Been lying in bed , but can’t sleep because of the pain and discomfort. 
Have no appetite and the chili’s come and go. 
Like one moment I feel cold , then I feel ok. Since I don’t have actual fever I’m holding off on taking any medication. 

As is I have a difficult time sleeping. 
The pain in the arm and body is making it harder to sleep . 
Only time will tell how I will feel in the morning. But if I get no sleep , I will feel tired . 

Either way I’m happy I got the vaccine as I’m sure whatever I’m feeling now is still better then getting covid or having to deal with long term effects of getting covid . ..... or possible even having covid cause the end of my life.",mzbyvd,2021-04-27 06:27:23

"I’m sure there are people out there having it much worst then myself . 

My point of sharing my experience isn’t to complain . It’s to share what I went through and hopefully encourage more people who hesitate getting the vaccine.

And to share what I did that may have helped my side effects to be just this , rather than worst. 

Everyone is different. My employer ( 40M ) just has a headache . 
One of his coworkers (35M - healthy ) was knocked down for 3 days and now he is fine . 
At the end of the day most people will get over the side effects….. as you did too. 
Just nice to read and hear what other people have gone through . 

People please get vaccinated!!!",mzbyvd,2021-04-27 18:06:34
"Hi! I am a 23 year old female and have a swollen lymph node under my armpit still. I got my first dose about 3 weeks ago now. So my symptoms: I have ibs and my stomach was bad 3 days after Like rly bad I puked (granted, I’m an anxious person and definitely worried all week before getting the vaccine and have ibs so I’m sure all that mixed with the vaccine made my stomach a mess), then I had a rly rly sore arm for the first 2 days and no pain under armpit but then on like the 3rd day, I noticed swollen lymph node near armpit like where fat is lol and a bit of pain and then it has definitely gotten better since then - not rly any pain under anymore, but it is still swollen. It was also rly itchy like a day ago idk if that had anything to do with it. So yesss I still have a swollen lymph node too and I’m about 3 weeks from the first dose. I have my second dose in about 10 days so I’m kinda nervous and idk what to do because right at the injection site hurts a tiny bit when I press on it and idk if it’s bad to get the vaccine on the same arm if I have a swollen lymph node but I also don’t want both armpits with swollen lymph nodes lmfao so this is my 3am rant - my doctor said it can take even a few months for the lymph nodes to drain and just to make sure you stay hydrated and get exercise (I haven’t exercised in like 2 years besides daily walks so maybe I should start going to the gym again LOL)",mzh7jo,2021-04-27 07:42:34

I've found that reading about other people's experiences actually gives me less anxiety... At least I don't feel like I'm the only one that's dealing with some of the symptoms I am.",mzgjz0,2021-04-27 23:09:55
"It's strange... I was the same way for shot 1 and since this one, I feel like I barely want to sleep that much at all. I don't know if it's just because I've been dealing with all the other BS symptoms, but I really don't feel tired.",mzgjz0,2021-04-27 23:11:41
"Same, it's pretty much all my stomach! Normally if I'm PMS bloated or whatever, I'll also get bloat in my thighs/lower legs, but it's really just distended stomach with this.",mzgjz0,2021-04-29 21:45:35
"So interesting...I feel like there are lots of anecdotal accounts of very mild allergic responses, obviously not anaphylactic. A lot of people who tend to have other skin allergies, asthma, eczema, etc., seem to be developing mild rashes (I have those conditions and got one). Who knows!",mzgjz0,2021-04-29 21:48:00
"I had a pretty awful response to the first dose. I'm not sure if I had covid before the vaccine because I never tested for antibodies. My second dose reaction was fairly mild. Experienced symptoms within 24 hours. Side effects (fatigue, fever, body aches) lasted for about a day. This is day two after the vaccine and I'm feeling up to 90%. 

Make sure you drink a lot of water before getting the shot and have Tylenol on hand!",mz75hm,2021-04-26 22:46:46
"First dose was sonewhat bad for me. Elevated heart rate (tachycardia since it was over 100 bpm), dizziness and brain fog (it almost felt as if I was stoned but not in the fun way), body aches, fatigue for five days, and migraines for five days. Sore arm too ofc. I never took my temp. 

I'm 9 hours into the second dose and so far nothing intense, just the sore arm and I was slightly tired but am not anymore. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but so far a much better experience, I was especially nervous about the elevated heart rate occurring again.",mz75hm,2021-04-27 02:59:30
For me the second dose was much easier and also the headache was gone after one day. No covid as far as I know. Overall a lot less stressed after I got my jab.,mz75hm,2021-04-27 04:13:48
"I had really hard time for about 5 days after the first shot- body aches, fatigue, fever, dizziness, brain fog, rapid heart beat, not so fun menstrual changes etc etc. got my Second dose on 4/12. I was concerned that it would be worse but the second round was far better. Hardly any side effects. I was a little tired day 1 and day 2 but other than that it was a breeze in comparison to shot one. Hope your experience for the second dose is like mine. Good luck!",mz75hm,2021-04-27 11:06:41
Just commenting so I can follow this.  Have had really bad experience with first.  Unsure of getting second.  Thanks for posting this.,mz75hm,2021-04-26 21:57:44
My second dose wasn’t bad,mz75hm,2021-04-26 22:10:10
"I had horrible symptoms after the first dose, but I was fine with the second one! Only a sore arm",mz75hm,2021-04-27 01:31:03
First dose yesterday and I feel awful.  Almost feels like hay fever...,mz75hm,2021-04-27 02:05:38
Following. I didn’t have COVID-19 before (tested many  times) and I had awful side effects literally IMMEDIATELY after the first dose.,mz75hm,2021-05-01 02:14:14
"23F, relatively healthy, usually just get migraines. I had my first dose on 4/21 and am experiencing similar symptoms. Had a sore arm for about 2 days and on 4/22 woke up with a severe headache in the back of my head. Had that same feeling of being stoned that lasted until about Sunday. I still feel some brain fog and just don’t feel “clear”. Feels like constant tension/pressure all over but predominantly on my left side of my head. How long did it take you to feel better? I know it’s only been 6 days post the 1st dose for me but I don’t wanna freak myself out too much. I just wanna feel normal again. Did you take anything besides a pain reliever to help?",mz75hm,2021-04-27 16:27:48
I’m so very glad the second one has been better so far 🤍 let us know if anything changes,mz75hm,2021-04-27 03:34:43
"Just wanted to check in and see if you ended up with any negative effects further out. I had a very similar first dose experience. I didn’t start to feel sick until two days later and felt a lot of what you did. Ended up at the hospital twice for tests and fluids, CT scan. I’m in Canada and dose two is coming in quick - I have a dr appt Tuesday to discuss if I should have another dose or not. Curious how things panned out for you.",mz75hm,2021-05-28 05:18:45
"That is so great to hear, I’m claiming this situation for my second go round. Thanks for your comment 🤍",mz75hm,2021-04-27 20:17:10
Have you had COVID-19 before?,mz75hm,2021-05-01 02:13:33
Same here. I just had my first dose Friday and it’s kicking my ass.,mz75hm,2021-04-26 22:57:27
"Im very nervous as well but the only thing giving me solace is the fact that I’ve read a couple of articles recently that stated the second shot can make the long haul symptoms go away in some patients. 

So I’m holding onto that, maybe the second one wraps things up somehow with the immune response",mz75hm,2021-04-27 00:03:10
"just got my first dose today. around 5 min after getting it i felt hot and dizzy and my throat was tingly and tight. pharmacist said it was normal and to sit down for longer. now im home a few hours later, my cheeks have gotten tingly, my pinky is numb right now, my chest was heavy and im feeling really foggy and somewhat dizzy. switching between feeling hot and cold. also nauseous. really dont know about the second one after this experience :/",mz75hm,2021-04-27 23:02:23
Was your first real bad?,mz75hm,2021-04-27 01:00:42
"For me, I got the shot Monday night and the headaches had stopped by Saturday. But from some people on this board it's taken longer, so I wouldn't be too worried about it.

I hope you feel better soon!",mz75hm,2021-04-29 01:16:55
"Thank you!

Just as an update, on the next day the shot did end up hitting me pretty hard. I woke up with a lowgrade fever and just felt like ass (body aches, headaches) for most of the day. Also had the tachycardia again unfortunately. But by the next day after that, I felt completely fine.",mz75hm,2021-04-29 01:17:54
"Sorry for the late response! I did update in the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/mz75hm/those_who_experienced_bad_symptoms_from_first/gw8lav1/

Basically I felt like ass for one day (around 12 hours). It wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to work, it mostly just felt like a mild flu.",mz75hm,2021-06-01 05:24:40
Not that I know of,mz75hm,2021-05-07 20:34:04
"I am a little over two weeks.  And, while many of my side effects have gone I have extreme inflammation still and my lymph nodes are very swollen especially in my armpit and neck area, it’s very painful and also causing copious amounts of breast pain.",mz75hm,2021-04-26 23:00:22
"Symptoms? 

Mine were headache, terrible chills, really bad body aches, high fever, blood pressure issues and fainting. 

It’s like my 10 days of covid hit within an 18-24 hour time frame, was worse than my covid symptoms tbh 

My biggest trouble since covid have been the long haul heart palpitation issues and inflammation and whatnot",mz75hm,2021-04-27 00:02:01
"Honestly I’m scared for my second shot, but the thing is.. these symptoms are supposed to be less dangerous than getting covid itself and that’s what’s getting me through this",mz75hm,2021-04-27 07:48:44
Too many unknowns with all of this.,mz75hm,2021-04-27 00:44:33
"Hang in there.  I and many others (from what I have read) had the tingly stuff as well, I still have my left hand and foot fall asleep and get the tingling sensation, but it’s less and less by the day.  If your throat still feels funny be sure to take some allergy medicine.  It seems like quite a few people have had almost like an anaphylactic reaction to these shots.",mz75hm,2021-04-27 23:15:58
"Yeah. Had flu like symptoms such as: headache, fatigue, my head felt foggy, I felt like I had a fever, and an overall uneasy feeling. But it lasted for a day or two",mz75hm,2021-04-27 01:04:30
"I had Covid 100 days ago. Still was told to get vaccine. 1st dose just gave arm pain at first but then 4 days later I developed a serious sinus infection (no fever) for about a week. Called the nurse and she said it was not related 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️.

Anywho, second dose started having sore arm 5 hours in and then 12 hours in woke up with fever, chills, body aches. Lasted about 4 hours then just felt groggy for another 12 hours. After 36 hours from 2nd vaccine, i was back to normal. Coming from someone who had a bad bout of Covid (fever for 5 days straight). This was nothing compared to it.",mz75hm,2021-04-27 03:26:21
Did you get the second shot?,mz75hm,2021-05-07 22:07:25
"Wow I’m so glad you commented, I have had debilitating costochondritis (chest inflammation) since covid in December. It has been awful and the vaccine has brought that back full force. 

I got bloodwork done a few days ago and my lymphocytes are high. (Inflammation cause probably) 

I’m just scared of my second shot because they say the second shot of Moderna has a much bigger hit than expected",mz75hm,2021-04-27 00:00:25
"I have a horrible headache (which is rare for me), body aches (my neck is crazy stiff), chills then sweating and feeling hot, bad nausea, IBS issues, and I’m super tired.  

I haven’t taken my temp yet, but I’m warm to the touch (per boyfriend), and flushed right now, so I’m sure I’m running warm.",mz75hm,2021-04-27 00:18:44
Yep that’s what’s so scary,mz75hm,2021-04-27 03:55:06
Yup,mz75hm,2021-05-07 22:16:03
"Yeah, idk what to think.  There are opinions floating everywhere with some saying that if you have trouble with the first, you won’t have trouble with the second and vice versa.  It’s been said if you had COVID, the shots shouldn’t be bad (but, obviously that isn’t true).  We have no solid facts yet about any of this.  I am fairly certain I had COVID before there was any testing, myself and one of my children were very very very ill.  Thankfully, no one was hospitalized.  I still get shooting pains in my rib area and other odd things, but my first shot truly knocked me on my ass in so many ways.  Just when I think I am on the other side of things, something else will crop up.  This lymph node stuff and HORRIBLE HORRIBLE breast pain is getting worse instead of better.  Why would I want to take the chance of going through this again?  I don’t even know when I will feel normal after shot #1!  I have called my docs office, but haven’t gone in yet, I probably should get some lab work done.  But, then I think, even if lab work is abnormal what will they do about it??  The ONLY thing that has helped ease my symptoms/side effects has been taking prednisone (which I use about 2-3 times a year for a very well controlled autoimmune disorder).  Sorry for the rant, I feel completely insane from this all 😂🤣😂🤣😂",mz75hm,2021-04-27 00:41:18
Did they do anything for you after you got your lab work back?,mz75hm,2021-04-27 00:43:52
My ibs cramps been going crazy since i started the treatment. 5 days into 2nd dose now and getting better but still hits me hard sometimes,mz75hm,2021-04-27 03:21:23
I sure hope you feel better quickly!,mz75hm,2021-04-27 01:01:29
Agreed,mz75hm,2021-04-27 04:02:02
How yah feeling?,mz75hm,2021-05-07 22:26:17
"I have heard the opposite, that if you had covid before the 1st shot will be rough. Second should be better.",mz75hm,2021-04-27 02:25:43
"Not yet my doctor hasn’t followed up with me much yet since the weekend, I feel like she’s not gonna know what to say she’s just gonna say immune response from vaccine",mz75hm,2021-04-27 01:01:13
"(After my first dose) I didn’t have bad stomach issues for the first 2 days, but on the 3rd day, my ibs kicked my ass. I’m such an anxious person so I feel like since I was super nervous to get the vaccine, just that anxiety built up definitely led to an ibs flare up, but the thing is - I don’t puke from ibs unless it’s from alcohol and 3 days after my vaccine, I legit puked out of nowhere it was bizarre!! I was so so so nauseas and thankfully I was home but it was bizarre and I wonder if it was just my ibs or if the vaccine triggered it idk",mz75hm,2021-04-27 07:47:55
Mostly fine. I got my second shot on April 12 but I have been having some ongoing menstrual problems that I think may be associated with the vaccine because I didn’t have any until the first shot. Otherwise it’s been totally worth it! Just some minor discomfort,mz75hm,2021-05-07 23:11:34
I have heard it every which way at this point 😂,mz75hm,2021-04-27 02:38:22
"Yep, exactly.  
Ughh, I am sorry you are feeling crappy from this and are going through this.  All of us that are getting these vaccinations are just trying to do the right thing and it’s so hard because we really have no idea what we are putting into our bodies and the long term effects of this....",mz75hm,2021-04-27 01:28:17
Dang! Sorry to hear. I never puke from ibs but i get really bad cramps and spasms and occasionally get pretty constipated,mz75hm,2021-04-27 12:30:23
"I’m glad you are doing better! I’ve heard about the menstrual issues, which makes me nervous, since I already have those!",mz75hm,2021-05-08 22:27:00
"Yeah I know, I completely am in the same boat with you on those thoughts",mz75hm,2021-04-27 03:33:34
"This was my experience as well. I think you fainted when you say everything turned black.

I fainted as well and then had fever for two days for which I took Tylenol. I am back to normal 7 days after my 2nd shot. Hang in there, eat length of fruits and have water, plus some Gatorade.",mz626m,2021-04-26 23:28:18
Wishing you a quick recovery!,mz626m,2021-04-27 02:15:21
Just got mine this morning. I feel achy all over with chills. I'm hoping powerade gets me through it.,mz626m,2021-04-27 02:27:02
"Most ppl who get covid don’t even know they have it without a test. Im confused how this is better, especially that in order for the vaccine to work they are calling for multiple boosters. Meaning u will feel this way every 6 months or so vs just getting natural immunity?",mz626m,2021-04-27 03:00:47
I'll offer an explanation:  COVID can kill you.,mz626m,2021-04-27 05:19:06
I’ll absolutely get a booster every 6 months and feel like crap for a few days if it not only protects myself but also protects my fellow humans that are unable to get vaccinated and rely on people like us to do it.,mz626m,2021-04-27 09:00:56
"First shot in Moderna round. Nothing in the way of symptoms. 27F. Was expecting to at least be tired, but nothing other than arm soreness! This was a few days ago.",myy3sj,2021-04-26 19:47:46
You’re lucky! I’m 20 and my second shot this past friday KNOCKED ME THE HELL OUT! I was so sick. I had the worst headache of my entire life!,myy3sj,2021-04-26 20:14:33
sorry to hear it! :(( but you're on the other side now!,myy3sj,2021-04-26 20:26:06
"I can’t answer your question about specific symptoms but I can absolutely empathize with your frustration with lack of good info about delayed side effects. 

I’m currently trying not to stress what appears to be “Covid arm”- which wouldn’t really bother me if it hadn’t occurred almost 2 months after the initial injection in that arm. I had Covid arm exactly 8 days after my second shot- it was aggravating but not terrible. My current Covid arm issue is at the site of my first injection on 3March. Will be contacting my doctor if it doesn’t improve in a few days. 

Hope you find relief, and answers, soon!",mz57kr,2021-04-26 20:34:20
"My husband and I recv’d 2nd dose on 4/8 - have not been the same since.  First couple of days were worse, he had fever.  We have had continued headaches and fatigue. I have had dizziness.",mz57kr,2021-04-26 22:10:08
I think there are many side affects of the vaccine that are not reported since it’s so new. I’m 4 days in after my 2nd and the flu part was tolerable and only lasted a day. Now my muscles are sore and cramping for absolutely no reason at all.,mz57kr,2021-04-26 21:09:42
"Yeah, it’s a thing. I googled it when my side effects started on day 7 (including Covid Arm, which you can look up for confirmation that folks are experiencing side effects about a week later).  Mine lasted about a week and a half, then slowly returned to normal.  

Just in time for my second shot, which I got this morning!",mz57kr,2021-04-27 02:21:15
"I had fever and fatigue days 1-3 then was totally fine until the following week. I had the “day 8” delayed skin reaction to shot 1. Itchy hands, fingers, wrists, ankles, feet, toes, elbows, and knees. Broke out into hives when I couldn’t resist trying to scratch for some relief. Took lots of Benadryl and Claritin for about 3 days until it cleared up. The delayed reaction was 10x worse for me. I just assume it was a delayed immune response as the shot started to work? No known allergies otherwise.",mz57kr,2021-04-27 10:51:30
"I completely agree w your above statements. It takes 2 weeks for ""full effect of vaccine"" to take place i.e. immunity so you are most likely experiencing side effect from vaccine...of course I'm not a doc.  I urge you to report it to VAERS and speak w your MD if it continues or you are worried about it.  Feel better!",mz57kr,2021-04-27 01:08:54
I’m 20 days out from my first vaccine and I have swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit where I got the vaccine and am also suuuuper exhausted. I just posted but then stumbled upon your post. I don’t have an answer but wanted to share my experience,mz57kr,2021-04-27 01:14:52
"I'm 17 days post 2nd shot and had a horrible headache show up along with stiff hand joints 9 days after the 2nd shot. The headache lasted until day 14 and thankfully let up, but the joint pain came to a large, painful crescendo yesterday. Today they aren't as bad, but its disturbing how no one seems to know how long these types of symptoms can last. Its exhausting.",mz57kr,2021-04-27 03:16:45
"I got hives on my face and neck 7 days after the first moderna shot. I had an appointment with a doctor, she said: well, we don’t know for sure, unlikely it’s because of the vaccine... take a claritin pill. 
I’ve never ever had any allergic reaction like this. Weird.",mz57kr,2021-04-27 03:13:08
Just wrote my experience two weeks post 2nd covid shot and it's similar to yours.  You are not alone.  Stay well.,mz57kr,2021-04-30 22:46:47

I did too! Exactly 7 days later.,mz57kr,2021-04-29 04:40:22
I got one I'm negative,mz57kr,2021-04-29 02:41:05
I had the migraines both when I got my first dose and when I had covid last year. the migraines were probably the worst symptom I had the entire time I was sick!,mzhzm1,2021-04-27 15:35:04
I literally just wrote the same post and found yours minutes later... except I’m 5 weeks post vaccine and dealing with these flare ups.,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 06:23:26
"I got my first dose about 3 weeks ago and still have a swollen lymph node under my armpit. It hurt for the first few days, but it doesn’t rly hurt anymore so I’m hoping that means it’s getting better. Lymph nodes can stay swollen up to months! I have my second dose in about 10 days so I’m pretty nervous, but hoping for the best. Also noticed my armpit was so itchy the other day idk if that had anything to do with this or just my deodorant acting up LOL oh also I heard to not wear deodorant (I have been trying not to), to drink lots of water and exercise

The lymph nodes popping up now could just be a delayed reaction to the vaccine! It could also be your body fighting off any other illness like a cold or anything really! My doctor said not to touch mine and to take warm showers.",mzbvw4,2021-04-27 07:51:44
Lymph nodes can be swollen for a lot of different reasons. I got my second shot a week ago and still have swollen lymph nodes as well. It takes a while for it to go down in general but be sure you aren't sick or fighting an infection,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 04:55:00
"I had really swollen lymph nodes 2 weeks after the first shot, but not the second.  It’s your immune system responding, like it should. It’s a good thing, even though it’s not pleasant! 

I had flu like symptoms both times, but it was slightly better for the second dose.

It was honestly worth it. Please still get your second shot!",mzbvw4,2021-04-27 12:53:44
I noticed a pea size lump under my armpit 3 weeks post 2nd vaccine and still have it 5 weeks post...was starting to worry because everything you read says they appear a few days post vaccine not weeks...,mzbvw4,2021-05-02 03:24:00
Do not take the second shot.,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 01:29:21
I just commented on your post! Lol,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 07:49:26
Thanks for the response :) I’m going to keep an eye on things,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 05:08:36
Why do you say that?,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 01:35:17
I called the pharmacy and they still suggest taking the second shot if these symptoms subside,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 02:10:58
I’m gonna still get the 2nd shot - I’d be more concerned with being half vaccinated and what those effects would be,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 07:50:05
I agree.,mzbvw4,2021-04-27 08:25:25
Try not to give it much thought! I didn’t experience anything with My first dose except for a sore arm.,mzbb5r,2021-04-27 02:22:20
"If you're arm hurts really bad (mine got really bad the first night, I couldn't get my bra off) it's tough but move it as much as you can for at least 1 minute. It really does help as well as putting cold washcloth after moving it around. It felt better next morning and no pain since then. Had a migraine once but hydrating helps 😀 Also congrats on the little one",mzbb5r,2021-04-27 02:37:17
If it makes you feel better I'm a Healthcare worker and pretty much are entire hospital had gotten the vaccine almost 1000 people nurses and doctors. I know the nursing supervisors are monitoring everyone that had the vaccine and get reports of any severe reactions and I was told there were no allergic or severe reactions out of everyone. There were people that got the covid arm including me. A week after the shot I had a redish rash and bump around the injection site. It took maybe 2 weeks to go away. It itched a little. I even went to the er and they did a altrasound to make sure my arm was ok and they told me it looked like just a normal  injection site response.,mzbb5r,2021-04-29 06:07:51
"Hang in there!  And try not to let this forum affect your worry too much.  I haven't met anyone with severe side effects yet.  I've had both shots.  Definitely lingering arm pain for a couple days, and I think some fatigue, general not so great feeling, but nothing like a bad flu or similar.  I hope it's the same for you.  Just try to relax and rest for a couple days, if possible.  Treat yourself nice :)  GOod luck!",mzbb5r,2021-04-27 03:24:47
"Congrats on getting your first shot! I'm 19 and got my first shot on Saturday with a friend. Friend didn't have any symptoms except tiredness. 

First night I had a low grade fever, second day I was still very tired and my joints felt achy. I'm on day three now and am feeling better, just a persistent headache (but I'm prone to those). All things considered, it wasn't that bad- probably comparable to a mild case of the flu.

I know you said resting isn't much of an option- but if you're able, I'd definitely try and get a friend or babysitter for a little bit, even if it's just so you can take a quick nap :)
Tylenol and Gatorade where also my best friends, especially if you end up running a fever",mzbb5r,2021-04-27 04:09:22

Thanks so much!,mzbb5r,2021-04-27 03:09:19
Thank you so much! Everyone’s been telling me everyone that loses weight just gains it back anyway and that IWL is fatphobic so I’ve been really discouraged. But thanks so much for that positive feedback! ❤️,mzbb5r,2021-04-29 13:50:22

Honestly I don’t agree with that people gain it back because it’s not true. Some people do if they don’t keep working towards their goal or stop once they get there but in general people don’t normally gain it back if they are continuing to exercise and/or eating better. I know how hard it can be losing weight so I applaud you hun! I hope you accomplish all your goals! 😊,mzbb5r,2021-04-29 18:54:48
Are you prone to anxiety?,mzdjaq,2021-04-27 03:37:05
"I had the EXACT same thing happen with mine. I thought I was crazy and maybe it was just anxiety, but I’m glad I’m not the only one! Not that I’m glad you felt so badly like I did, but ya know.",mzdjaq,2021-04-27 15:40:31
"same thing happened to me, but i had a tingly/tight throat feeling as well, and my chest felt heavy. still lingering hours later :/",mzdjaq,2021-04-27 23:05:21
I had the exact same thing happen. About to get my second shot on May 4th. I've been meaning to talk to my doctor about getting my second shot because of the reaction I had to the first,mzdjaq,2021-04-28 01:36:00
"I was a little anxious. However, I was laughing and joking with the nurse and felt relaxed during the injection. Afterwards, the first 5 minutes while I was waiting I felt fine and relaxed. But this felt like something very physical happening, a wave of heat and sweat (my shirt was damp in places). It came out of nowhere.",mzdjaq,2021-04-27 03:44:40
"It's nice to know other people go through the same thing. I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty terrified of getting the second one now!",mzdjaq,2021-04-27 21:26:23
"Got it.  I have anxiety about anything medical, so get the same feeling anytime I have a test done",mzdjaq,2021-04-27 14:17:00
I actually got my second one this morning so roughly 8 hours ago. I warned the nurses there and brought a cold water with me and tried to distract myself on my phone. I stayed 5 minutes over the 15 minutes just to be sure. I was very hot and sweaty immediately after but no where near as bad as the first dose. I went to work (20 minute drive) but i did start feeling dizzy and fatigued and just out of it so i came home and slept for a bit and now i’m feeling a bit better. good luck to you on your second dose!,mzdjaq,2021-04-28 01:35:30
"FWIW I had the “day 8” delayed skin reaction to shot 1. Itchy hands, fingers, wrists, ankles, feet, toes, elbows, and knees. Broke out into hives when I couldn’t resist trying to scratch for some relief. Took lots of Benadryl and Claritin for about 3 days until it cleared up. Other than that I just had a fever for a few days after the shot. The delayed reaction was 10x worse for me. Very nervous for shot 2. Try to drink a lot of water with added electrolytes (something like ultima or nuun), take a warm bath with a LOT of epsom salt and take it easy. I’m sorry friend :( I hope You feel better soon. Keep us updated.",mzk0zj,2021-04-27 10:45:58
"Updated above...  
Otherwise, I was one of the folks with a better second shot than the first, I guess unless last night was my reaction. But since I had been at that party Saturday, I was feeling a little guilty.",mzk0zj,2021-04-27 15:35:55
"Thanks for the update! Glad it’s getting better. Hope you’re good to go, soon!",mzk0zj,2021-04-27 20:53:22
"I'm now convinced I had an accelerated case of Covid?  As a side effect, 10 days later?  It was actually intriguing in retrospect. Like, at the age of 39, I pretty much know my body and how I feel when I catch the flu as compared to a cold, a sinus infection, etc. And I was curious about how Covid feels. 
I didn't mention earlier the mind fog and clumsiness.

Actually here is what I wrote earlier, aka the next day.

""Hey so I had a really interesting reaction to the vaccine...  
10 days after my second shot that was almost symptom free for the first 3 days.... 
I had Covid for an hour? 
1am crazy shivering, can't get warm in scalding hot shower
4am woke up struggling to breathe
Itchy, hot skin with rash
Probable fever
Stuffy nose
Wheezing gagging cough
Slight sore throat
And a weird ass mind fog

It lasted only an hour! 
I laid back down so I could wake up early an find a rapid test so I could see if it was a breakthrough, but I woke up 5 hours later like nothing had happened, except my skin was sensitive all day. 

All in all, in retrospect, very worth it, and it gave me a chance to experience it without really getting it. ”",mzk0zj,2021-04-29 05:25:21

I also had some pretty severe shaking. I think it’s a reaction from the fever. Pretty painful when your body is already super sore!,mzamke,2021-04-27 12:48:46
I'm also a migraine sufferer. The Moderna migrains are milder but more frequent for me. I got migraines the day after and everyday since. I'm on day five. I Had extreme fatigue pretty much slept for the first 3 days and dozed off in the shower a couple of times. I'm stilI a bit tired. The back of my neck is tender.

"I hope it works out that way for me cuz then it'll be over soon, at least with the migraines anyway. I'm gonna buy ibuprofen asap for the swollen lymph nodes. I was so excited for a vaccine though.

I don’t know if it’s related but 5 days after my first shot I had a spontaneous subcapsular renal hematoma. The pain was ridiculous- worse than labor pain. Tonight I go for my second vaccine- we’ll see if it happens again (please no). I’ll be very curious to see what your pain is all about. If the pain gets consistent & worse definitely go to the ER.,mz89rt,2021-04-27 12:31:32

"It's the early morning of day 3 for me and I have very similar pain! It feels so much like a kidney stone (I had one when I was 19 and the pain is absolutely unforgettable!) but was sort of downplaying this feeling as perhaps trapped gas. It's only in my hip/pelvic region in the front of my body and not my lower back which is another reason as to why I thought it may simply be gas.

Guess I should get some juice when the stores open so I can begin to flush out my system.

Hope your pain resolved, OP!",mz89rt,2021-05-03 08:41:55
Did it happen again?,mz89rt,2021-04-29 15:48:51
Currently experiencing more pain in kidney area- sharp pains come & go. Urology said if it gets worse to go to the ER. I asked for a CT just to get ahead of it & so far they haven’t scheduled it.,mz89rt,2021-04-29 15:51:02

Currently 4 days late after getting the 2nd dose about 2 weeks ago. Had some spotting but that’s it!,myqk96,2021-05-16 15:04:53
Had the second dose two weeks ago and my period is supposed to start around now (4weeks) but no spotting or symptoms. I did bleed four days a few days after the second shot...not light enough for a pantyliner but light enough for a pad. Getting worried.,myqk96,2021-05-17 12:44:34
"Thank you so much everyone, I really appreciate all the comments and hearing about everyone’s experiences. It makes me less anxious on receiving my second dose of the Moderna shot, which is in a few weeks. Fingers crossed that the next time around will be normal.",myqk96,2021-04-26 21:07:51
I got the second dose 2 weeks ago. I finished my period a few days ago but now I'm feeling the same pelvic/lower back and leg pain that I usually get BEFORE starting ny period. it's odd.. although I'm not sure if it's related to the vaccine..but this has never happened to me before.,myqk96,2021-04-27 01:37:00
So weird I just read this today: https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/coronavirus/does-the-covid-vaccine-affect-your-period-survey-launched-after-some-report-changes-to-menstruation/2494064/,myqk96,2021-04-27 03:50:37
Mine was a week early.,myqk96,2021-04-27 04:09:40
Mine is infinitely more painful than normal.,myqk96,2021-05-06 00:49:28
Started this morning at 7:30 am. Have felt like I have been in a fog all day.,myqk96,2021-05-06 03:12:23
"Yes, it’s been a lil longer actually. I started my period April 14th, but spotted on and off until the 29th. I received my 2nd dose on on May 6th, so i have a feeling this period is also going to be super delayed. I also only had sex once during this time span, and have taken multiple prego test, all negative. I feel like I’ve been pmsing for 2 weeks now and it’s super uncomfortable.",myqk96,2021-05-19 01:01:47
"🤞🏻, feel better soon!",myqk96,2021-05-19 17:23:55
"Hi, thank you for checking in. I’m still late, but by 13 days 😭, and I’ve been pmsing for the past 3 weeks. Negative tests over here as well, I’ve been doing that twice a week. I hope our periods come soon 🤞🏻,bc this is making me so moody lol.",myqk96,2021-05-25 17:01:50
Yoi guys are so dumb. Why would you get the poison. You are test subjects. You are aware that mRNA has never ever passed animal trial testing when they attempted it years ago and it’s not a vaccine 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️,myqk96,2021-04-27 04:34:17
"Thank you so much for your response, it was very helpful and eased my mind a lot.",myqk96,2021-04-26 20:57:10
"Did your spotting last long? It’s been 3-4 days of spotting for me so far, and this is a few days after I ended my 7 day period.",myqk96,2021-04-27 00:07:43
Have you received your 2nd shot yet?,myqk96,2021-04-27 01:05:13
"Oh no, is this after your first or second shot and how are you feeling now?",myqk96,2021-04-27 01:06:02
Me too! I had SUPER light/spotty flow 5 days early then nothing. I'm now two days late when going off my scheduled start date and my breasts are sore aka my consistent PMS symptom. We shall see 🤷🏻‍♀️,myqk96,2021-05-10 17:21:22
"Mine was 9 days late, I had a regular 7 day cycle, but 2-3 days after I started to spot. The spotting lasted for 5 days  and now I’m back to normal. I’m getting my 2nd dose tomorrow, so I won’t know if it will happen again.",myqk96,2021-05-05 20:26:20
Currently 7 days late. I’m cranky and feel like I’m about to start but each day—nothing yet.,myqk96,2021-05-06 02:40:54
"Did this happen on your first dose as well? My first dose, my period was super irregular, 9 days late and I spotted 2-3 days after and that lasted for another 5-7 days or so. I’m on my 2nd dose and am currently 5 days late.",myqk96,2021-05-18 04:35:57
I’ve been hearing a few people getting their period twice in one month after the vaccine with similar symptoms as yours. Let’s hope that it’s bc of the vaccine and that it won’t last long. I hope you feel better soon.,myqk96,2021-04-27 02:01:41
"That’s terrible, I’m sorry to hear that! I’m glad I’m not the only one but this really sucks for us. Here’s hoping our periods arrive this week, I’m about to take a pregnancy test too for peace of mind.",myqk96,2021-05-19 12:12:29
Hi just checking in! Day 8 here with some PMS symptoms on and off and another negative test. How’re you doing?,myqk96,2021-05-25 11:43:10
Been spotting brown for two days and now my period arrived (red now)! 10 days late... I’m sure yours will arrive soon too! This vaccine though 🤦‍♀️,myqk96,2021-05-27 15:48:40

"It’s really my body, my choice on what I put in my body. If you don’t have an experience to share, I suggest you keep your comments to yourself.",myqk96,2021-04-27 09:59:09
"Roughly 10 days for me. It was unusual enough to prompt my Dr. to contemplate an ultrasound. I'm still debating it. If it happens again on shot 2, I'll feel more confident it's related. It was just really odd timing, especially with the way my boobs went nutso, too.",myqk96,2021-04-27 00:10:11
"yes! i got my first shot 3/15, got my second shot on 4/12 and finally had a period on 4/24",myqk96,2021-04-27 01:29:31
"this started about a week after my shot, and it came a couple days later than normal. I can't even walk properly right now without something giving out or fainting. I have POTS so the fainting isn't entirely out of the ordinary, but it's still concerning. Thankfully a close friend came over to keep an eye on me and visit while my partner is at work today.",myqk96,2021-04-27 01:11:56
"It did not. I had minor side effects after the first dose and all the bad side effects on the second.  I got my period regularly and no spots after the first dose. I only had sex once this month too, been on the pill for two years. Has it been four weeks since your last period from the first dose?",myqk96,2021-05-19 00:49:19
"I’ve also heard other women who have gone through menopause spotting or bleeding after the vaccine as well. Let’s just hope it’s all related, it’s super strange that so many of us are having similar problems. I hope all goes well with you on your 2nd shot❤️",myqk96,2021-04-27 00:43:12
"Oh good, thank goodness you got it. That was a very late period, I hope everything goes well for you.",myqk96,2021-04-27 01:58:27
"I accidentally fucked up and scheduled my knee tattoo the day after my second shot, hopefully it all works out by then, i may be in for a real wild ride",myqk96,2021-04-27 01:13:18
I hope you feel better soon and I hope things go well after your 2nd shot.,myqk96,2021-04-27 01:55:45
I'm on day 4 since shot 2. Horrible headache and nausea. Yesterday I thought I turned a corner and woke up like this. So frustrating,myvssy,2021-04-26 16:21:01
"I’m In the same exact boat! Terrible muscle aches, worst headache, flipping and flopping all night, overall feeling terrible.",myvssy,2021-04-26 13:14:54
"A hangover is exactly how I described it. It’s like I drank a bottle of tequila and no water before bed. I got my second dose at 5:00 pm. Woke up at 4 am with body shakes and couldn’t fall back asleep. All day was intense, like a hangover mixed with the flu. It finally broke around 7pm the same day and I’ve felt ok ever since. It was pretty bad but I’m still glad I got vaccinated. Currently 3 days post shot 30yo female.",myvssy,2021-04-26 16:31:17
"Yep, I had a terrible headache and it felt like I was hungover.",myvssy,2021-04-26 17:01:21
"20F I had the worst headache of my life, had extremely dry mouth and throat, super thirsty, and I was so sore I couldn’t even move lol.",myvssy,2021-04-26 20:15:35
Yes! I flopped all night. I just couldn't breath and I was so sore I couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep. I took excedrine for the headache but its only dulled it. And I just wanna spend today in darkness.,myvssy,2021-04-26 13:19:30
I’m currently sitting in a dark room haha but this has to be 10x better than having covid,myvssy,2021-04-26 13:48:56
Yes! I am glad I got the shots but god i feel like trash. Can't imagine covid.,myvssy,2021-04-26 13:53:48
I got this with my second dose,myw3cq,2021-04-26 13:13:41
"Yes! I had this along with a headache, dizziness (which could have been from the headache) and fatigue. 

I thought the stomach ache was strange and possibly unrelated, but maybe not.",myw3cq,2021-04-26 13:16:32
"..and how long did it take  to go away ?  Im  a bit scared i must admit ... when all you do all day is hear news about people getting Thrombosis  after the Vaccine  ,u  become oversensitive  i guess 🙄",myw3cq,2021-04-26 13:19:18
"No idea, I just got my second dose yesterday. Did quite the number on me",myw3cq,2021-04-26 13:49:36
"i got my shot today and the doctor said should i experience a stomach ache after day 4, go see a doctor to be safe.",myw3cq,2021-04-26 17:01:07
"I got my first dose this past Friday and I started feeling nauseous, my heart raced in the evening finally calmed down before bed. Saturday my stomach was very upset and continues to be. I’ve always had stomach issues on antibiotics so not sure if this is along the same lines. I just feel uncomfortable.",myw3cq,2021-04-26 17:50:22
"Yes, my boyfriend has been complaining about a sudden bad toothache a day after receiving the shot.",myqkgs,2021-04-26 09:12:33
Yes! On the surface of my teeth it was really sensitive. Felt like cavity pain but all over on the surface. I posted about this when it happened to me because it freaked me out. It only lasted 2 days for me.,myqkgs,2021-04-26 16:26:58
"Me too, I thought I fractured a molar but it must have been side effects and inflammation. It has slowly gone away.",myqkgs,2021-04-26 18:47:43
"The back of the right side of my mouth has blisters ALL over it, canker sores out the wazoo and i’ve never had them there. happened maybe three hours after first shot and i’m in day five and living the nightmare",myqkgs,2021-04-27 00:42:56
"OMG I thought I had to see my dentist! My second dose was on Friday, yesterday I had pain in one of my molars",myqkgs,2021-04-27 01:28:36
Interesting. Got 2nd dose at 10am this morning. Teeth felt sensitive brushing tonight but I didn't think anything of it till just now reading this.,myqkgs,2021-04-27 01:36:47
"Yes!  The last top right molar - it feels like a root canal is on my horizon but this came on all of a sudden, 5 days after my fist shot.",myqkgs,2021-04-27 07:08:21
[deleted],myqkgs,2021-04-26 06:39:48
"I had the same issue! I thought I was going to have to make a trip to the dentist. But I am 4 days after my second shot and all teeth discomfort/pain is gone.

Also like to note this started right after my 1st shot - so I dealt with it for roughly a month.",myqkgs,2021-04-27 16:50:57
same here! i got my second dose early 4-28 and by mid 4-29 all my teeth are achey and sensitive. try to wear my night mouth guard but that seems to make the pain worse. 😢,myqkgs,2021-04-30 02:28:21
"I had pressure pain and sensitivity pain in all of my teeth after my first dose, went away after a couple days",myqkgs,2021-05-05 13:03:31
Yes. Teeth got sensitive right after shot 2 of Moderna. Went away after a few days.,myqkgs,2021-05-06 11:59:33
Horrible ache in my front teeth after first dose... So so painful.,myqkgs,2021-05-24 19:53:25
"Thanks for letting me know, yea that sounds like exactly what I’m experiencing. I got a cavity filled a few weeks ago so at first I thought my new filling busted off but the pain is in different teeth so that makes no sense, hoping it’ll be gone tomorrow",myqkgs,2021-04-26 19:22:59
"Glad to hear it went away for you, hoping for the same here",myqkgs,2021-04-26 19:23:15
YES! Literally my eyes were so sensitive I was involuntarily tearing up when walking out of my vaccine place after the 15 min,myqkgs,2021-04-26 06:49:01
Sounds like migraine symptoms to me!! Feel better!,myqkgs,2021-04-26 14:41:53
"Damn a month? I’m four days in and questioning whether I have a cavity and am procrastinating dentist in hopes of it being a side effect, that gives me some hope it’ll go away",myqkgs,2021-04-27 19:25:55

"Male here.  I had my 1st dose 6 days ago and other than a sore arm I had no side effects for over 24 hours.  Soon after that I got so damn tired and I still can't shake it.  Today doesn't feel any better than yesterday.  It is affecting my work.

I should also let you know that I had cancer treatment in 2016 which has weakened my immune system.",myr6ig,2021-04-26 12:53:10
"46 F. What you describe sounds about right for my Dose 2 experience. 8 days post Dose 2 now and still have a bit of lingering fatigue and inflammation. I take two Advil every night or I can’t sleep. 

Dose 1 was way worse. All the shit side effects. I had Covid last year. 

My partner 64 M also had Covid. He had zero side effects with both doses. None. Nada. Zilch.",myr6ig,2021-04-26 17:22:24
"I was hit SUPER hard for my second dose! For my first dose I felt dizzy, weak, had a headache, and passed out for a 6hr nap lol. I felt better the next day. I’m a female and have definitely been thrown off by my intense side effects!",myr6ig,2021-04-26 20:19:43
My boyfriend and I never got COVID but he got the shot the same time as me and only was met with some fatigue and sore arm. Nothing close to how I was feeling!,myr6ig,2021-04-27 00:22:56
"I have rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune disease) and experienced what appeared to be lingering side effects, especially inflammation, for about 9-10 days after my second shot on April 7th. My rheumatologist told me to wait 2 weeks before restarting my steroid regimen and to only take ibuprofen before that.",myle57,2021-04-26 05:36:44
"Yes. 46F. 8 days post Dose 2 and I am still waking up in the morning drenched in sweat. Still hitting a fatigue wall every evening about 9 pm. I understand it’s inflammation caused by my body building antibodies, but damn, I sure wish this would end. Looking forward to feeling like myself again. Soon!",myle57,2021-04-26 17:18:21
"Hi, I was vaccinated on 04/21/2021 (55M) and have hypothyroidism. I had a 101.1 temp the next day. I feel okay now, though. Still some fatigue.",myle57,2021-04-26 02:53:26
Not me.  Source:1 dude today,myle57,2021-04-26 08:58:15
"I had mine on the 22nd as well. I felt better yesterday and then woke with nausea, headache and muscle aches. I feel like my heath has gone to crap since the first one. Not sure what to do",myle57,2021-04-26 16:23:07
We all have got this! Right lol?,myle57,2021-04-26 21:04:48
Same here! Can’t wait for it to pass and go back to normal and I’m only 4 days in.,myle57,2021-04-26 17:44:29
"I’ll admit I had the quick flu and it sucked at the time but after 24 hrs that passed and I’m way better from that part. It’s just the odd lingering crap that I hope is still temporary and didn’t wake up anything bad in my body because it sure feels like it set something off.
My bf got the other one and his health is good and he’s completely normal now.",myle57,2021-04-26 02:55:36
I feel that. I felt like I was getting a grip on my health before the vaccine and now I’m taking steps backwards. 4 days after the 2nd shot and my calves and thumb tendons are cramps and sore for absolutely no reason.,myle57,2021-04-26 17:43:45
I hope so lol. It seems like anyone with a medical history suffers the lingering affects compared to those without.,myle57,2021-04-26 21:07:16
Mr too! I have been in tears thinking I made a mistake or I'm crazy. I know my immune system is suppressed from medication so it has to be working overtime with these shots. I'm scared ill never get my health back.  Is it normal to still feel this way after 4 days 2nd shot?,myle57,2021-04-26 19:37:44
"Yep I have severe anxiety and depression, thyroid, and arthritis",myle57,2021-04-26 21:10:12
I mean I’m 4 days in and feel shortness of breath and muscle cramps and pains. All the ppl in my family are fine but when I go on here I find more ppl who seem to have lingering affects. My boss got hers a week before me and she said she still feels tired and today she feels sick with a sore throat and stiff neck. Her husband told her he felt sick for almost two weeks or just not the same. I feel like my liver or gallbladder’s inflamed.,myle57,2021-04-26 19:52:18
So sorry! Hopefully we all will feel better soon. No one  in my family had long side effects either. They think I'm crazy,myle57,2021-04-26 21:03:16
Update: 6am now and I still can’t sleep.. I have a 101.4 fever.. my usual temp is 97.7,mysyox,2021-04-26 10:51:05

"I've read that's a side effect for some, though it wasn't an issue for me after my first shot a few weeks ago.

I've had hives in the past, and Allegra has cleared them up fairly quickly, so if they're becoming a distraction, that might help.",myss4y,2021-04-26 15:43:01
Hi there my mom 58F had a sort of itchy rash all over her chest for her first and second dose. It went away after a few days not hives tho. I had a mild rash on my cheek from my 2nd dose but it went away after 2 days!,myss4y,2021-04-26 20:16:37
"I got hives on my face and neck 7 days after the first moderna shot. I had an appointment with a doctor, she said: well, we don’t know for sure, unlikely it’s because of the vaccine... take a claritin pill. 
I’ve never ever had any allergic reaction like this. Weird.",myss4y,2021-04-27 03:16:08
Thank you!!,myss4y,2021-04-27 23:51:55

"Hi fellow arm pain sufferer!  I got my first April 8th.  Had arm pain for about two days after, and then nine days later my injection site got red and my arm became painful again.  It went away a couple days later.  Then a few days ago it started hurting again (no redness) and I felt exhausted, body aches, headache, and chills.  I got a PCR test which was negative.  I’m 38 F, healthy, and in pretty good shape.  I’m not going to lie, I’m pretty nervous for my next one too!",mykh21,2021-04-26 02:01:13
"That sounds unusual. My arm pain (23/f) went away after  about 48 hours of my first dose. I havent gotten the 2nd dose yet, but no arm pain after the 48 hour mark. Maybe give your primary care doctor a call and explain your concern. Do you have any other symptoms?",mykh21,2021-04-26 01:48:48
"I got my first dose on March 28 and just got my second dose today, the arm pain never went away.",mykh21,2021-04-26 02:10:22
"I got freaked out by this too and checked in with my doc - apparently it’s a normal but somewhat less common side effect called COVID arm ,as someone else mentioned.   I got mine 10 days after my shot - the hard lump and severe pain went away after about 2-3 days, I still have mild swelling and a small rash about 10 days later.  Annoying, but not terrible!",mykh21,2021-04-26 04:18:28
Is there anyway to space out the doses? I mean your at 80% with the first one- can you push dose out further?,mykh21,2021-04-26 02:38:25
"Oof that sounds so painful, I’m sorry. Hmmm maybe they went too far into the muscle or something? I’m not a doctor though.

Edit: I did a quick google and found this post by a phsyician who had a delayed reaction: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/heal-the-mind-heal-the-body/202101/what-s-the-new-phenomenon-called-covid-vaccine-arm

Don’t get freaked out by the title, in the author’s case, it resolved itself.

Edit 2: there’s this as well: https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a35823752/covid-arm-rash-pain-vaccine/",mykh21,2021-04-26 02:56:18
"I got my first dose the same day as you! Around 11AM-ish, then went straight to work.

I had no symptoms at all until 5 PM that evening, felt unusually tired and couldn't open my eyes, so I stuffed myself with food which seemed to help. My shoulder was sore too but it got worse the next day. I was unable to sleep on my side so I had to resort to sleeping on my back (cue immense back pain the following morning). Also I couldn't raise my arm, but I kept forcing myself to move it around throughout the day.

I have no pain anymore but the injection site is a teeny bit itchy, and piping hot. It's like there's a fever going on there or something. My other shoulder is room-temperature, but that particular arm has this slightly red patch that might be a rash. My mom is also having the same side effects but she has this large bump that looks like a pimple in its beginning stages.

You should at least try to move that arm, even though it hurts. My mom has a friend who's going through the exact same thing as you are, but she can no longer lift her arm past her shoulder anymore, and has crippling neck/back pain.

My dad and brother had worse side effects than me and my mom did, both of them were groggy and tired and felt feverish, along with body aches.

The people at the clinic said you should never use a heat compress on the site, only ice. 

Instead of going back in 4 weeks maybe go back in 6 weeks instead. Also make sure for the next one they use a different arm! 

It's also possible like another user mentioned they went a little too deep in the arm. I didn't feel the needle go in at all, but the way the person at the vaccine clinic did it, he was in a rush and wasn't careful with it at all, just jabbed in the needle without giving it a second thought, and put a band aid over it and told me I was all set.",mykh21,2021-04-26 05:48:54
"I’m going through the same right now, got the vaccine April 15 no side effects other than a sore arm that went away in 2 days. 8 days after I got the vaccine the sore arm came back full force, no rash. I see a lot of people talking about “Covid arm” but they only mention the rash. I really hope this goes away soon! I’m afraid to get the second dose!",mykh21,2021-04-27 02:13:05
"Hi, how are you doing?!",mykh21,2021-05-09 07:17:49
Thank you for sharing! What is a PCR test?,mykh21,2021-04-26 11:46:56
How are you doing after your second dose? Did you get it on your other arm?,mykh21,2021-05-10 02:37:50
"It’s still a bit sore! Very mild though. I’m scheduled to receive my second dose on Thursday, and am a little nervous about it. My doctor seems to think the soreness was from the way the needle was inserted rather than from the contents of the vaccine itself.",mykh21,2021-05-09 11:17:17

"I’m still sore as well! I went to 2 doctors and they just said, “we don’t know” and they think it may be my immune system reacting to the vaccine. Since I don’t have a rash or inflammation they can’t really see anything worrying. Some days I feel like is more sore than others. My second shot is on Friday! I’m very nervous, I’m afraid of getting the same pain in my other arm.",mykh21,2021-05-10 02:36:37
so does this mean she doesn't have covid or hasn't developed antibodies?,mykh21,2021-04-27 18:56:08

My doctor said it can last up to 2 weeks.,mywfyr,2021-04-26 21:39:45
Mine lasted for about six weeks but only really itched for one of those before it faded away very slowly. Heat (like hot showers) made it worse.,mywfyr,2021-04-29 04:43:38
"Yep! I’m 3 weeks out and my longest side effect has been muscle pain in my legs, and aching in my groin around my lymph nodes. Tonight it was in my knees. It’s now only happening to me at night....before it was all day long. I started taking a super tiny dose of THC-infused honey and that definitely helps. It’s not enough to effect me mentally, but the pain eases almost right away. No idea why it’s lasting so long!",mymrve,2021-04-26 05:33:32
"Yes. 46F. It’s inflammation as our bodies build antibodies to Covid. The process can take up to 6 weeks, I’ve been told. I am 8 days post Dose 2 and I have lingering fatigue, muscle and joint pain flare ups and I’m  still waking up every morning drenched in sweat. 

It’s getting better day by day, but I still have to take two Advil every night or I don’t sleep. 

I had a hip injury 7 years ago that is now giving me problems again after years of being totally fine. It’s all related to the inflammation. 

Looking forward to being on the other side of this. Cheers!",mymrve,2021-04-26 17:28:48

I had non of this before the shot and I have done nothing but lay in bed on day 1 and clean my house and do laundry on day two. I just worked my retail job today so I just stood. Like no reason for this feeling.,mymrve,2021-04-26 06:27:37

Lightheaded, raging body aches and headache unlike anything ever experienced......except that one time with tequila.....anyway it went on for 48 hours. Then it stopped. Like light switch switching Off. I woke up feeling almost back to normal. Came very close to going to er at the time of.But didn't. I better Not catch covid after going through all this.

"Had my second dose yesterday. About an hour after the shot I was so tired I napped all afternoon. This morning I had chills, fever, body aches and a sore arm. Basically felt like I was hit by a truck. Feeling sore but better this evening. I’m a F in my 50’s. Glad I am done because I can’t imagine how bad Covid would be if the vaccine is this bad...",mycyak,2021-04-25 23:46:36
Just had mine today. Arm lil sore. Really tired though. First shot had side effects for a few days. Hoping nothing happens this time.,mycyak,2021-04-25 22:10:50
"Second dose yesterday afternoon. F43. I asked them to inject my other arm as I sleep on my left side which they did. Strangely, my left arm started to hurt along with my right. Besides an pain and light fatigue, I was fine. 
Today I have no appetite, food is unappealing. I have bad body aches and a tremendous amount of weakness. Also, my hip and knee are really hurting. 👌",mycyak,2021-04-26 00:11:54
"46F. Hit hard by Dose 1 (I had Covid last year). I’m now 8 days post Dose 2 and feeling a-ok. I still wake up every morning covered in sweat — as if I’m running a slight fever through the night and then it breaks. 

2nd Dose was much better for me, but I still had about 3 days of real fever (100 degrees-ish), body aches, joint pain and fatigue. 

For those still feeling a bit under the weather after the first few days, you are likely experiencing the same thing I am, which is lingering inflammation. 

As your body builds antibodies to Covid, it creates inflammation, which ramps up your temperature slightly. It can slow you down and make you feel sluggish and/or achy. 

My partner, 64M, also had Covid last year and had zero side effects with both doses. 

The scientists will eventually figure out why women are reporting harsher side effects and in greater numbers than men. And hopefully tweak the vaccine or dosage so that we do not have to suffer through these terrible side effects every time we go in for a booster. Otherwise, I fear women of all ages will begin to experience vaccine hesitancy. 

The side effects are definitely better than going through Covid, but no one has the time to deal with 6-8 weeks of feeling like shit for a vaccine, especially if we’re going to have to get it every six months. 

In any case, I’m happy and grateful to have the vaccine so we can start getting our lives back to normal. 

Hang in there, ladies. You’re almost through it. Cheers!",mycyak,2021-04-26 17:03:41
Hope you feel better soon!  And glad you will be safer now : ),mycyak,2021-04-25 21:40:25
"Interesting it seems that the couples we know, including ourselves, the woman seems to be hit harder. My husband had no side effects with either dose. I only had a sore arm and maybe a little fatigue with the first, but the second knocked me on my butt for a couple of days. Fever, headache, aches, and a dry cough, which is still lingering.",mycyak,2021-04-25 20:45:10
"There's some talk about women being hit harder, but also talk of some reporting bias. It's on either the Moderna site or CDC. May be hormornal effects.",mycyak,2021-04-25 20:55:57
"I saw someone say that on cable news too -- more reported side effects in younger people and women.    


My sleep has been very erratic lately, and sometimes really deep like I need it, but I'm not sure if that's the vaccine or that I've been mostly isolated and without a set schedule.",mycyak,2021-04-25 21:01:58
Is there any chance you were exposed to COVID between now and then?,mymtgi,2021-04-26 05:30:23
"Your symptoms will come and go as your body builds antibodies against Covid. It can take up to six weeks to achieve full protection with the Moderna shot. 

I’m 8 days post Dose 2 and still having flare ups of fatigue, muscle aches, night sweats. Just your good guy immune system doing its job. Hang in there!",mymtgi,2021-04-26 17:36:11
"I'm experiencing that right now.

I'm 27 and in good health. Only difference is I had no side effects for about a week after my first shot, and now I have extreme fatigue, brain fog and so on.

I also wondered if I caught covid immediately after my shot but obviously there is no way to tell whether its that, the shot or something completely different. But I've never experienced this level of fatigue and cloudiness before.

I don't have anything else to share unfortunately as I'm in the midst of it and can't find any information regarding it. Can you keep this updated if things change and I will update too?",mymtgi,2021-04-26 20:36:52
"Its possible, but I was never in a situation where I was particularly at risk for covid.  No gatherings, staying six feet away + masks (usually an N95), no outings beyond necessary errands. But of course its always possible. My girlfriend is fine and we live together.",mymtgi,2021-04-26 09:46:49

"Thanks for the link. Heres a weird update: I feel a lot better today after making myself do some exercise/physical labor yesterday. Which was totally unintuitive as my body was making me feel like rest is what I need. But I remembered one time having the flu when I was 16 but I had a job under very complicated circumstances so I had to go to work anyway and wore myself out hiking up and down a mountain and doing hard labor with a pickaxe... Got back to camp and passed out, woke up right as rain. So I decided to give that same thing a try and push my body (not too hard as I have a heart condition) and now today I feel fantastic. But it might be a coincidence. Furthermore, this seems to be *my* bodys reaction to exercise during illness, but it might be really bad for someone else, so I'm not trying to hand this out as advice. But that is what happened. (I'm biologically female by the way, and strongly suspect that I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (waiting for a cardio appointment for dnosis) if any of that matters)",mymtgi,2021-04-26 21:48:35
"Depending on the cause I would bet that a healthy or active lifestyle could relieve our symptoms.

For sufferers of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (which is what this feels like), exercise might make things worse. But if, for us, this is illness or vaccine related then staying healthy might be a faster route to recovery. Glad to hear you're feeling better.",mymtgi,2021-04-26 22:08:17

I got my 2n dose Thurs. Also had the brain fog and vertigo/woozy feeling--but had migraines too & I usually have the vertigo feeling with those. Today I don't feel so foggy but did have moments of wooziness. I wonder if Dramamine would help you like it does for me with the migraines/dizzy feeling?

"This same experience happened to me and I also got my shot Wed. I had a high fever for about 15 hours and then woke up Friday with dizziness and ringing on and off in one ear. 

Saturday the ringing was gone, but I still have a feeling like I need to clear that ear. 

I have had vertigo ever since and can’t get rid of the dizziness. I have tried alternating NSAIDs, 25 mg Benadryl at night and 4mg zofran for nausea during the day. Nothing impacts the vertigo. 

Doctor Rxed me Antivert today and I’m going to try that (same active ingredient as Bonine) and they referred me to an ENT who got me in tomorrow am.

I am really trying to resolve this as I can’t drive or look at screens which are kind of critical actions in my life. Really hoping to see someone say it got better for them soon bc these forums aren’t giving me a lot of hope! I’ll report back what the ENT says.

You won't need a second one.,myjgj2,2021-05-07 00:02:34
"Fair enough. I should have been more clear with my choice of words. You have a massively reduced chance of getting seriously ill or dying from the disease that has killed millions of people world-wide, and a massively reduced chance of being infected in the first place. So far these results are lasting for at least six months, and it’s likely they last even longer. 

Everyone can choose for themselves what is good for them....but I do feel that the potential side effects should be put into context. If you spend some time reading the COVIDPositive sub, those people are really suffering and they sound legitimately scared. I had side effects from the shot, but they were not nearly as bad as COVID sounds....and I had zero worry along with it. I’ve also been through a handful of health issues, so I’m not afraid to feel badly for possibly a few days. I had hyperemesis when I was pregnant. I puked all day long, every single day, for five months. I was so dizzy and exhausted I could barely stand. This shot was NOT that.",myjgj2,2021-04-27 14:32:37

The nurse who checked in with me while I was waiting for 15 minutes after the shot said that since I had a strong reaction to the first shot I would have a strong reaction to the second shot and that the first person should never have told me anything different.",myjgj2,2021-05-07 18:47:39

Around 9 pm I had extreme chills and could not stop shivering.  Fever and body aches returned.  Now I understand the “getting hit by a bus” description. Finally fell asleep around midnight. I think the worst is behind me but I’m completely wiped out this morning.  Going back to bed.,mylaet,2021-04-26 12:49:58
You poor thing that is awful!!!! I hope you are feeling better. Praying for you that you get better!!! God bless you!!!,myhayb,2021-04-25 23:32:57
Jeez.. I dont think low oxygen levels or heart rate spiking to 150 is a normal reaction.. but im no doctor,myhayb,2021-04-26 04:49:53
"The first thing I’d say is to try and stop reading because that’ll probably make the anxiety worse. This is from one anxious person to another.

Second of all, if it’s any consolation, I haven’t heard from anyone I know that they vomited after the second dose. I got my second dose yesterday and my worst symptom is tiredness, followed by brain fog and feeling lightheaded. Haven’t felt sick to my stomach.

Good luck!",mygrog,2021-04-25 22:28:17
"Hi from one emetophobe to another! I did exactly what you did, almost made myself sick from reading about all the possible side effects of dose #2. Had mine on Saturday afternoon, tried to ""let go and trust."" So far, so good. Yesterday: Headache, aches and pains, low grade fever, exhaustion, unable to get comfortable. Better sleep last night and overall feeling better today. Had some mild quease this morning, felt better after eating, addressing everything with water and Tylenol.

Hang in there, keep breathing! Your post is from yesterday so please let us know how you're feeling today! You got this!",mygrog,2021-04-26 19:20:32
Any update?,mygrog,2021-04-27 18:35:03
"I just read this and I am scheduled for tomorrow, also.  I am also going to stop reading these comments and just pray all goes well for both of us.  Everyone is different.  People just seem to share more negative reactions in this forum.",mygrog,2021-04-26 04:08:43
"Hello fellow emetophobe! Good luck tomorrow! I am also nervous for my second dose (scheduled for 5/4), but I haven’t known or heard of anyone throwing up from the vaccine. Fingers crossed!",mygrog,2021-04-26 04:37:44
"What helps me with anxiety is to focus on what could go right. It's so easy for me to overthink and come up with the most catastrophic ""what if"" scenarios, but it's also possible that it could go well. Think of your best case scenario, or even a ""good enough"" case scenario. For me, knowing what to expect and being prepared helps my anxiety, so I'm glad I was mostly ready for what I felt.

Distraction also helps me when I'm anxious, so I tend to tell medical people this during visits. Lastly, sometimes I make a list of what I fear vs. what I know. This helps bring me back to the present reality.",mygrog,2021-04-26 04:41:41
"I recommend you listen to The Anxious Truth podcast. It’s helped me a lot. Like someone else has said, focus on what could go right. Millions of doses have been given out and of course you’re going to hear more from the few who have issues and not the MAJORITY of people who get the shot and go about their days and weeks as normal.",mygrog,2021-04-26 05:59:35
"First of all your name! Love it! Hah. Second of all, THANK YOU. I appreciate the tough stranger love lol. I keep almost canceling my appointment tomorrow because I have a two tests on zoom (my final) for school Tuesday. Again, it’s on zoom so even if I feel crappy it’s not like I have to actually go to class. 
Did you get moderna also? 
Thank you for your kind response.",mygrog,2021-04-25 23:29:51
Hello! I actually am getting my shot today. I was able to find an appointment closer to where I live (other was over an hour away) and so I’m going in about an hour. Still extremely nervous. Almost on the verge of wimping out but I know I have to do this. You’re response actually couldn’t be better timing! Thank you and I will keep in touch for support and updates !,mygrog,2021-04-26 19:24:35
"I’ve been nauseas, shaky, numb, no appetite and very irritable all day from anxiety. So I may as well have just gotten the shot yesterday and be dealing with side effects. Lol.",mygrog,2021-04-26 19:25:17
"Hello! Yes! I’m alive and well lol. First of all no I did not throw up! I woke up around 4 am with some chills and painful body aches ( especially my legs). I mean, painful painful. But I got my heating pad and watched some Netflix to take my mind off of it. That entire day was a doozy. Really I was fine until the Tylenol would wear off around hour 4 and the aches and overall crummy feeling would creep back in. Very tired. But kinda a nice treat to lay around and do nothing and not feel bad about it. Honestly, felt like you ran into a wall a few times but totally bearable. Would do it again 10/10 and feel like I accomplished something huge by being vaccinated despite my health anxiety.",mygrog,2021-04-29 07:04:07
Yes!! So true. The least we can do is be there for one another as internet strangers. If you need to chat or anything feel free! We will be totally fine I know it lol,mygrog,2021-04-26 07:43:15
"I'm getting my first dose tomorrow too. I know reading through all this isn't the best for me but I'm really trying to prepare myself but still remind myself that most people who don't have a bad experience don't think to post about it...I'm really nervous but I think if my family members felt fine, maybe I should too? I don't know if it works like that but that's what I've been telling myself at least to reduce my anxiety hahaha",mygrog,2021-04-27 02:19:09
Hellooo!! Thank you for reaching out to a fellow emetophobe and I appreciate the kind words. I haven’t heard from anyone throwing up either so I think it’s gonna be ok. Am I still going to stock the house with ginger ale and saltines? Yes. Why? Because life of an emetophobe. Oy. Haha. Best of luck to you as well for your first <3,mygrog,2021-04-26 07:45:38
"Hi! Thank you so much for that podcast recommendation. I always love a good podcast, and perhaps I’ll need some distraction post shot tomorrow ;) I love that as a reminder, Most people don’t go online post shot and start writing novels...they just keep going with life and are like “ damn my arm hurts. Oh well lol”",mygrog,2021-04-26 07:47:26

You hanging in?",mygrog,2021-04-26 23:03:37
"Yeah, hanging in. I feel tired but I’m sure that’s from anxiety all day. Just awaiting all the horrors I imagined. But I have faith it will be just fine. Took two Tylenol two hours after the shot and plan to take two every 6 hours.",mygrog,2021-04-27 01:29:47
"I’m so glad you posted. I took my 2nd shot yesterday morning. I went through all of the symptoms in the first 8 hrs. About 30 min after driving myself home I felt nauseous. Then came a pounding headache like I haven’t had in a while. I ended up taking 2 Tylenol ES twice over. Slept for about 5-6hrs. If was early evening by time I got up and ate and started feeling better. Went to bed feeling good. 
Woke up today not so good. Slept ok but was achy and tossed and turned and was sometimes hot. Didn’t sweat or have a fever. Now I feel like I did some rigorous exercises yesterday. Everything is sore and my arm feels like a deep bruise. I’m probably gonna take a few more Tylenol today and just lay in bed. I’m a 41/M.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 16:06:17
"Yeah the worst was over about 24 hours. I had some strange lingering effects but honestly can you tell it was from the shot? I’m fine now. While I was in that 24 hours tho I kept thinking no way this was some short illness, but it really did turn around just as quickly as it came.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 16:08:36
"Had mine yesterday at noon, I've slept (not very well) like 14 hours since then but am starting to perk up a bit now (22 hours post dose) could not get warm for a while there but now finally feeling the ridiculous blanket nest is a little too hot. Hopefully that's the end of it for me too!",my9mdx,2021-04-25 18:05:06
"I got my 2nd shot yesterday too. 12 hours after I started shivering. When I measured my temperature it was 98.2. But as shivers progressed and didn’t go away, I measured it once again in about an hour and it was 101.8. Tylenol didn’t really help. I took 3 pills till the morning and it still was around 100.7. Then I took Advil and it actually went back to normal pretty fast. That was about 4 hours ago, but now I’m feeling that my temperature is slowly raising again.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 18:18:54
"Mine went surprisingly fast too (although still keeping my fingers crossed). It's like my body freaked out then got it together (much like my anxious mind does in times of stress LOL). The headache was the worst though, as it finally went away a little over 48 hours later. I feel very fortunate.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 17:45:43
"Yeah, I had an almost 102 fever the night of the second shot, but felt fine the next morning. Then about two days later I noticed my resting heart rate would go up for stretches of time. That happened on and off for a couple of days, but I think I'm past that now. 

I feel like I got off easy compared to a lot of people.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 18:44:57
"This is pretty much what I had (27F), got the shot at 10:30am yesterday, did fine until 7pm or so, started getting chills without fever and went to bed around 9 - woke up at 11 or 12 with a 102 fever, took some tylenol, was gone when I woke up in the morning. I feel normal now other than fatigue and slight headache, fingers crossed that's actually the end of it",my9mdx,2021-04-25 23:25:10
"Sounds like me, I'm currently on the second night after my shot (Sat 11am, arm started hurting a few hours after that, then a massive explosion of miserable symptoms all at once by midnight) and I feel ""better"" compared to last night, but still so bad that I would have a lot of trouble if I had had to go to work today.

Definitely had a fever but I didn't take my temp because I was so cold I didn't want to remove any body part from under my blankets. Constant sweating, had to change the sheets this morning and will change again before bed tonight (cause I woke up at noon, ate and drank, then went back to bed for 8 hours of more sweating and weird dreams). Muscle cramps, shivering to the point of pain, nausea (this has let up, thankfully), and ""brain fog"" like I've got the flu.

Oddly enough my fiance experienced much of this on Easier Mode about 6 hours after the shot yesterday and hit the sack while I was still fine, today he's pretty much 100% recovered. I'm still comparatively miserable and will be heading back to bed very soon.",my9mdx,2021-04-26 03:28:46
"No, this was from the shot I could tell. The chills, the awful headache, the sweating, feeling under the weather - unless somehow I wrapped myself up too warmly (and I mean, I did that as a response to feeling like I was freezing - I was shivering), I can’t trace it to anything but the vaccine. 

It’s over now. It was just bizarre how quick it was.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 16:11:34

"That headache is comparable to drinking too much whiskey or red wine and getting a hangover from hell. (Those alcohols have congeners and those accelerate hangovers. Granted I cannot say I have ever had a hangover, but I know a little what it probably feels like.)",my9mdx,2021-04-25 18:15:14
Today I’ll be honest and say I’m a bit weakened and depleted but otherwise fine. Mostly from waking up at 3:30 AM.,my9mdx,2021-04-25 19:49:29

"I don’t know if mine is *back* but I feel a bit achy and weakened. I compared it to a fire that blazed intensely for one moment and then died out, but as we know, fires take a while to die out completely. There will still be smoldering embers.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 22:45:25
"Yes! It was like a bad hangover, but one that lasted longer.",my9mdx,2021-04-25 18:34:29

Were you anxious at all? I get face numbness from anxiety and it’s freaky. I had all kinds of weird symptoms after I got my shot which I attribute to anxiety.,my7q33,2021-04-25 19:52:40
"Interesting you say feet pain. I had my first shot almost 3 weeks ago, and about a week in I started getting foot/ankle pain. Especially when I wake up in the morning. Also, an overall soreness throughout my body. These symptoms have been with me every day for the last ~2weeks and I'm also highly considering skipping shot #2. Only other random side affect has been night sweats that soak the sheets. 4x in 3 weeks is super abnormal.",my7q33,2021-04-25 23:34:13
I also had numbness and some other strange side effects that I contribute to my anxiety as well.,my7q33,2021-04-25 20:39:36
Maybe? I dont know I’ve never felt that sensation before though so i dont think it was just coincidence,my7q33,2021-04-26 00:21:59
Yeah it’s been really strange. I have four weeks to make up my mind I guess. I’m starting to regret even getting it. With so much unknowns. Should have just waited for the j&j to come back. As dumb as it might sound. It’s only one shot and from my understanding it’s more along the lines of traditional vaccines. So the technology is more understood. This new mRNA thing freaks me out.,my7q33,2021-04-26 00:25:38
"Four days after I got my first dose of Moderna, I started to have small patches of rashes on my left jaw and my left arm where I got the shot. The rash spread throughout my whole face, causing my eyelids, cheeks, and lips to swell. No difficulty breathing, fortunately. The rash also spread throughout BOTH of my arms, and now the rash is appearing on my thighs. I went to Urgent Care to receive steroid shot and am currently taking steroid medication orally. Swelling did calm down, but I look like I have been under the sun for a whole week.. my face and my arms are so red..",mylv8e,2021-04-28 01:21:03

"The same thing happened to me, my theory is that your immune system has two parts of response. Adaptive and innate. Innate responds quickly but adaptive takes longer.",myatwq,2021-04-25 17:54:00
"First shot - Fatigue, swollen and hard arm. Day four massive swollen lymph node in arm pit. Day eight swollen lymph nodes in neck, both sides. Took a until day 11 for the swelling to go down for arm and neck. Felt fatigue the whole time. Body aches the first few days after shot and then again when lymph nodes were swollen. 

Second shot yesterday. Last night I was straight up shivering. Took Tylenol and it seemed to help. Today have fatigue, body aches, lower back pain and shivering every time the Tylenol wears off.  

Hoping I don’t have the extended response again. That was a tough week and a half with the first shot. F42, healthy.",myatwq,2021-04-25 19:41:41

Doctor. Seriously.,my02xe,2021-04-25 06:57:39

"My mom’s arm went red when she got her second dose, similar to your upper arm in the photo, but not the forearm or face. In her case, it settled down after a day. For me, I didn’t have any redness.

They may be able to proscribe some antihistamines to help.",my02xe,2021-04-25 14:05:29
You’ll need to see a doctor to get a prescription for oral steroids to stop the inflammatory response you’re having. My friend had this reaction too. Go to an urgent care to be seen soon.,my02xe,2021-04-26 01:56:35
"YES!!! 2nd shot Monday April 19 and I developed a migrating rash all over.  I have been on steroids for a week and now am bedridden with a headache and fatigue.  If I'm moving around, I get the rash and it appears variously on hands, arms, feet, legs, back, face and head.  The itching has gotten better from steroids and benadryl at night, claritin by day.  I do have an autoimmune disorder so was leary about getting the shot.  If I knew this would have happened, I would have skipped it.",my02xe,2021-04-30 22:40:21
"UPDATE!!

Seeing how Benadryl was not helping but only making me drowsy, I went into Urgent Care. I was recommended not to take the second dose of
Moderna, but rather wait until way later after I recover to get J&J or other vaccine.
I was given a steroid shot on my buttocks, and hours later I started to notice the rash disappearing!! Thank goodness... I was prescribed prednisone and will start taking taking tomorrow. Another medication I got prescribed is Hydroxyzine hcl, which is similar to Benadryl “but better” per doctor. 
I was so depressed, thinking this will never get resolved. And i honestly thought going to the Urgent Care was going to be a waste of time. But I am glad I went and got the shot. Of course, it would be best to avoid steroids altogether, but desperate time calls for desperate measures sigh.
Thank you everyone who have been so concerned about me. I hope this interesting case can hell other people too!!
I will keep you guys posted after couple days too!

Edit: format


——


I received my first dose of Moderna on April 15, I was on dicloxacillin because of mastitis (I am currently breastfeeding). As soon as I was done with my dose of antibiotics, I started to notice a red patch on my jaw. As days went by, it started to spread all over my face. I also noticed the “Moderna arm”, and the rash also spread all over from my wrist to my shoulder.

My face is so swollen, that my eyelids feel so heavy and can barely keep my eyes open. My cheeks are also sagging because of edema. There is so much swelling that it is putting pressure over my face and giving me a headache.

Fortunately, I don’t have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Just slight heat sensation but no fever or chills.

I was wondering if anybody else got this? If so, what has helped you.
I need take care of a newborn so taking Benadryl is out of question.. I cannot be drowsy while taking care of my baby. I am taking Claritin instead and I just hope that helps..",my02xe,2021-04-25 04:48:05

None. They have been controlled by medication for years so there was some concern. They literally started 15 minutes after the first shot and were really strong and frequent for nearly 3 weeks.

I kept my gym membership and went to the gym and walked the indoor track three times a week. I was able to get fully vaccinated just two weeks ago. I am flying back west next week. My family is now vaccinated, but we didn’t stop living.",mxnk5v,2021-04-25 21:26:21
Yessss!!! I was already self-cutting before the pandemic because it saves so much time and money! Plus I don't have any complicated styles to maintain so it's east to do it myself.,mxnk5v,2021-04-25 11:01:09
I can make mine look decent and admittedly the free part is nice!  But for me and my hair it literally takes me DAYS to make it look okay.,mxnk5v,2021-04-24 21:16:17
Also we were just saying here that we plan to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places indefinitely,mxnk5v,2021-04-24 21:17:33
My husband has been fully vaccinated (Pfizer) for a few months and he's joined a gym! We wouldn't have felt comfortable with him going otherwise. He's loving it.,mxnk5v,2021-04-25 00:13:00
That sounds wonderful!  I’ve been inside more lately than any other time in my life and I’m starting to feel like my apartment is a set of clothes.,mxnk5v,2021-04-24 21:18:43
"The more natural curl the more forgiving of a home cut, lol.  The one tip I learned to trim my hair without ending up with a straight chopped edge is to take small sections and twist them before cutting the end off.",mxnk5v,2021-04-24 23:22:40
"Haircut for me too. I did a self cut about six months ago and while it wasn't bad, I need a pro. Mainly because I need them to use the razor scissors to thin it and take some weight off.",mxnk5v,2021-04-25 17:57:20
No dying!!,mxnk5v,2021-04-25 16:36:23
You aren’t going to die. Just take it easy tomorrow and stay hydrated. Will be praying 🙏 that your vaccine will go well for you tomorrow!!!,mxnk5v,2021-04-25 21:34:46
Being outdoors with friends sounds wonderful!,mxnk5v,2021-04-24 21:19:44
I like not having to make awkward small talk with the hairdresser. I hate that.,mxnk5v,2021-04-25 03:01:47
Exactly! I can’t wait to go somewhere and hear the waves and have the sun on my face without worrying that I’m going to end up infected. Before the vaccine I hadn’t left my own yard in over 6 months and even then it was to curbside pick up groceries. The past year I’ve been in the grocery store twice. It’s been awful but I made it without catching Covid!,mxnk5v,2021-04-24 22:11:06
"Almost 12 hrs in, little bit of soreness on arm, feeling tired but that might be normal. I thought I was feeling itchy earlier but that has passed",mxnk5v,2021-04-27 00:46:35
"33 hours since second shot. Im not feeling good, my body aches and my stomach hurts",mxnk5v,2021-04-27 22:13:26
"I've had the internal tremors/shakiness before my vaccine,  it was usually from extreme anxiety.  This vaccine has severely amped up my physical anxiety symptoms for sure.  I got the internal tremors, weepiness, panic attacks, tinnitus,  random heart racing, nausea,  etc. 
I would bet you are just experiencing the uptick in anxiety, maybe caused from the inflammation.",mxmi7p,2021-04-25 12:01:53
"The vaccine seems to have ""ramped up"" my neuro system.  I have had horrible headaches, anxiety, light-headedness, dizziness...have you spoken with your MD?",mxmi7p,2021-04-25 13:16:09
"yes i’ve had them before too but not at this level!! so far all i’ve had is tremors, random heart racing and uptick in anxiety. did yours eventually level out?",mxmi7p,2021-04-25 15:06:30
i’ve def had more anxiety since i got it but luckily not the others. i have and she thinks it’s stress / anxiety related to my job and said there’s not much we know about the vaccine :/,mxmi7p,2021-04-25 15:04:56
"Day 12 now and the overall anxiety has calmed down. The heart racing only happens maybe once or twice and doesn't last long. The tremors come and go, depending on how active I've been. I'm still fighting massive fatigue, but overall I think I'm on the way back to normal.",mxmi7p,2021-04-25 15:14:42
i’m on day 15 with an onset 3-4 days after. i’ve been resting these past days and have been feeling a bit better. tremors aren’t 100% gone tho. i’m so sorry you’re feeling this way and i’m glad you’re back on the road to normal! pls keep me posted on how you feel,mxmi7p,2021-04-25 16:31:28
"Wow, it’s literally 4AM here and I am currently getting wrecked by the second Moderna shot. Fever, chills, and extreme fatigue. Probably the strangest part is my thoughts are all over the place, I had gone earlier in the night to watch the Demon Slayer movie and for 3 hours after I got home and tried to sleep,  I actually thought I was IN the movie ffs. Body temperature is pretty high as well at the moment, I hope this does not last all day today",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 12:05:55
It’s really interesting to see how much different each person’s experiences are with the shots. I got my second one three and a half days ago and have had no symptoms on either shot. Not even my arm.(I mean anymore than a shot would hurt). The point is nobody knows how you’ll react so anyone reading this don’t be scared to do it. Drink plenty of water a couple days before and eat clean the 24 hours before & hope for the best.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 09:37:01
"It’s interesting how the symptoms are widely shared, but not the degree to which they are suffered. Got my second shot on Wednesday. On Thursday, had mild nausea, mild body aches, and a few chills. Seems like the same set of symptoms, just significantly milder in their expression.",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 10:53:37
Fucckk me I’m scared. I get dose #1 on Monday and I’m have no idea what to expect. Everyone around me has had completely different side effects. I already have a severe stomach condition that makes me nauseous all the time and I can’t afford to miss any work 😫,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 16:32:46
"I was up sick last night too, and had a fever but that seems to be gone now. I have a splitting headache and body aches, and am really tired. At one point last night I tried to walk across the bedroom to put my cats perch in the window so she would stop meowing and I had to stop halfway and lay down on the floor for a minute. My second shot was yesterday morning. My friend who had the same shots didn’t have any symptoms at all.",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 14:31:14
Crazy body aches.  And slight headache. Had #2 at noon yesterday.  I only had a sore arm and a swollen lymph node after the first.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 15:47:52
"Disclaimer- my experience was a bit wild and maybe edge case.

Got my Moderna shot a week ago, after 15 hours my heart rate started rising and I fainted in bathroom. Then fever around 100-102 for about 72 hours. After than fever broke and things back to normal. Now after a week, I feel tired and woozy but no fever and heart rate back to normal. I think in a few days the woozy ness will go away too. I am really happy I am vaccinated and would do it again.",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 19:52:10
"I had all the same effects, chills body aches, fever, nausea, headache literally my whole body hurt the day after the shot even my fingers hurt. Walking hurt. Started at midnight 12 hours after the shot and the first thing was uncontrollable chills/ shivering. It only lasted a day and night two I sweat in my sleep as if I was running a marathon! Pretty much feel fine now just have lingering fatigue and when I walk around or stand too long my legs start feeling weak like I had been working out. Today is 4 days post shot. Did anyone else have leg weakness after?",mxf8r5,2021-04-25 00:10:12
I'm scared.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 15:10:42
"Ugh I just found this sub bc I’m on day 3 of #2 and I have had splitting headaches, horrible muscles aches and waves of nausea. I haven’t been sick in years. The first one made me sick too for over a week. It’s felt like my left eye is going to pop out for 2 fking days. Wtf kind of “vaccine” is this?!",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 10:50:56
Lool I took the second shot yesterday at 3pm. I felt a bit of nausea at the midnight but only that. Should I still be careful about the side effects?,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 16:14:16
"Did you all choose Moderna over Pfizer? Or was random? Curious if most people are getting Moderna now (by default).

From all I have heard (limited folks), seems Pfizer second dose has had less of symptoms compared to Moderna. Thinking if I should just go with Pfizer 😅",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 18:14:36
"I didn’t choose, they just gave me Moderna. I’m 60, for what that’s worth. First shot, very mild soreness in the shot arm the next day was the only side effect. Got second shot yesterday at 1:00 and so far the arm is a bit more sore and that’s it. I’m a tiny bit anxious as to what may come. Many of my coworkers (all age ranges) have had a pretty bad next day reaction to both J&J and Pfizer and I’m the Moderna guinea pig so I don’t know??",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 18:51:46
"Got 2nd shot Thursday afternoon, Friday had splitting headache, weakness,   chills, body aches, elevated heart rate for a couple hours. Saturday I'm feeling 80 percent better with weakness and some slight headache. 

The first shit of Moderna only made me sleepy",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 22:19:20
Seriously no joke. I got my second dose on Wednesday and had fevers for the next two days. The highest ir got was 102.5. I don't have a fever today but the exhaustion is overwhelming. I have a huge red itchy welt on my arm. I don't know if I want to do this every six months but will if need be.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 23:42:52
"Agreed, 45F healthy, received second Moderna shot at 11:30 am Sat, was seemingly fine and then woke up in the middle of the night with horrible body aches. Like everything hurts, inner ear, toes, lips...! I don’t even know if I have a fever bc it is too painful for me to go get the thermometer!!! I wish that CVS or personally my own self would of inquired what to do or what to take to feel better. But with that said, my 74 year old father had zero issues!! So folks, don’t let it scare you but be prepared if you do happen to have side effects. ❤️",mxf8r5,2021-04-25 14:28:07
"Moderna 2 for this healthy 35F- 14 hours in and I’m laying in bed can’t sleep can’t move my body is aching like lightning bolts all throughout my body- inside and skin, and ears and toes and lips- everything hurts. I came here to get some company for this misery fakkkk",mxf8r5,2021-05-19 11:24:54
You’re so right about the thought aspect. Got my second dose yesterday and last night felt like some delirious fever dream where my dreams and reality just blended together.,mxf8r5,2021-04-25 17:43:13
"This message wasn’t to scare people. You are right not everyone has the same symptoms or any at all. It’s just good to get a wide variety of opinions on others symptoms, so someone doesn’t freak out if they get them.",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 09:39:28
Same here. No side effects.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 20:43:53
Can you send me a message of what you did before?,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 22:57:30
Zofran and Pepcid,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 17:26:03
"I think you will be ok with the first shot. It seems like the second shot holds the bigger punch. But like you said, the symptoms are different for everyone so it might not be bad at all for you! But yes if you could get Zofran from a doctor, that worked really well for me last night",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 18:52:48
I have UC and got no side effects either shot.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 20:44:40
I had leg weakness after my first shot. I left work and was actually scared to drive home but did anyway. Passed out for like 3 hours then had splitting headaches for two days. Oh yeah and my face was numb for a few hours after my first shot. Not sure if I even want to get the second after all that.,mxf8r5,2021-04-25 00:47:13
Sounds exactly like my experience but I haven’t got out of bed yet to test the leg strength! But feeling rotten and threw up in the middle of the night.,mxf8r5,2021-05-01 15:38:51
I wouldn't worry about it. Those side effects are just a sign of the immune system working as it should. What is a minor inconvenience to you is lethal to a virus. As it should be.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 17:22:35
"Dont be scared! I kinda was too but.. while unpleasant, the side effects didn’t last long (for me at least) and they weirdly made me happy because I knew they were making me immune to covid",mxf8r5,2021-04-25 05:17:29
It’s a cocktail of maybe’s but your better off with it than without it,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 16:42:36
The doctor told me it could be overnight or the next day you might have symptoms. Sounds to me like you are ok!,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 18:53:35
"I just went with whatever Kroger was offering, which was moderna. I haven’t heard to much about Pfizer symptoms.",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 18:50:23
"Pfizer has fewer side effects. All my county had was Moderna, but I had no side effects.",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 20:46:01
I just went with whatever what first available. That was more of a priority to me than side effects.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 23:25:51
Yup I agree. I don’t think you were trying to scare anybody. Just wanted to put my experience out there to level out expectations .,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 10:10:41
"What’s this for,",mxf8r5,2021-04-24 22:58:50
I had leg weakness on and off for just over two weeks after shot #2.,mxf8r5,2021-04-25 14:38:07
I agree. I felt bad last night and this morning but I’m fine now.,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 20:57:59
😘,mxf8r5,2021-04-24 10:14:34
For that user’s stomach problems in case they get exacerbated by the vaccine. Both meds helped me a lot after dose #2.,mxf8r5,2021-04-25 01:30:39
Is this something to take only with stomach problems/ just grabber has much info as I can before my second dose,mxf8r5,2021-04-25 08:14:42
"Zofran is an anti-nausea medicine. If you feel nauseous after your second dose, you could ask your doctor to call in some dissolvable Zofran...that’s what I did. The Pepcid helps neutralize the acid in your stomach, which helps with nausea as well. And if you DO vomit, it doesn’t hurt your throat as much (less burning). It sounds like most people aren’t feeling nauseous or vomiting, but I did both. Those two meds helped get me through. Good luck!!",mxf8r5,2021-04-25 14:36:01
I dont think it can be a side effect if it's before.,mxzazo,2021-04-25 04:13:29
I've been having sexual dreams way more frequently after vaccination.,mxzazo,2021-04-25 15:47:06
I had unusually lousy dreams the night after.  Wish I had the other kind,mxzazo,2021-04-25 20:32:03
Yes! Slept 15 hours after the first dose with wild erotic and lucid dreams.,mxzazo,2021-05-01 20:49:36

I felt like I had mild shin splints for one evening after my second. Not what you're describing though.,mxnflo,2021-04-24 21:23:33
[deleted],mxnflo,2021-04-24 20:22:57
Yes that’s what I experienced. Leg cramps/Charlie horses for a week after 1st shot.,mxnflo,2021-04-24 21:54:40
thanks all for your replies,mxnflo,2021-04-24 22:04:21

"Dude the left and right side of my neck are absolutely fucked too. My fingers are even sore.

I run a lot and it's like the second dose mainly took my muscles that are slightly worked/sore every day and multiplied that by 20!",mxnflo,2021-04-25 03:53:13

I had terrible leg pain after 2nd vaccine. Woke me up in the middle of the night and kept me awake until 4 a.m.,mxnflo,2021-04-25 05:17:25
"Five days after first shot I had terrible leg pain (both legs), nausea, stomach cramps. Still have the stomach cramps 48 hrs later. The leg pain was worse than anything.",mxnflo,2021-04-26 03:34:03
I had the muscle spasms too! Everyone I told blew me off and defended the vaccine but I know my body and I’ve never felt that before.,mxnflo,2021-04-24 21:55:59
I have leg weakness since second shot and I have been a sufferer of RLS restless leg syndrome and the nights since the shot it’s been terrible. Definitely affects the legs.,mxnflo,2021-04-25 00:15:15
"jeez
. that is a long time.. I'm only first day but it seems to help when I take tylenol. I'm glad yours went away",mxnflo,2021-04-25 01:03:34
"yeah it is weird but tylenol seemed to help me. without it, i feel it. but with it i dont feel much
i hope yours goes away soon.",mxnflo,2021-04-25 01:04:18
"Oh jeez that sounds so painful 🤣

yes i know what you mean about the fingers!! It is so odd",mxnflo,2021-04-25 04:25:18
"ok.. a lot of ppl are feeling the same
that makes me less worried but it still sucks lol

mine have gone down though it was mostly within the first 24 hrs it seems... i def feel for those still going thru it",mxnflo,2021-04-25 04:26:17
It was awful. The cramps wouldn’t go away no matter what I did. Sitting still my legs would tighten and twitch and I’d get the urge to get up and walk which only made it worse,mxnflo,2021-04-25 01:28:08
I’m 26hrs post second shot and the body aches were SO much worse than I ever expected. It was hard to lie still in bed because just the pressure of laying down made my back and hips feel like they were being split in half. I hope this is over soon.,mxlqfq,2021-04-25 02:03:13
"I don't know about you, but I didn't feel 100% better until about five days post second shot.",mxlqfq,2021-05-03 01:56:18
Yes. I’m a week out of my second shot and I had a very hard time moving weight when trying to lift. May actually take this week off and hopefully it comes back. Feels like an inflammatory response—lymph nodes under arm are swollen still too. Super tired. I had covid though so I think my response to vaccine was pretty aggressive. Hang in there,mxmu2r,2021-04-25 12:09:08
I lifted a few days after getting the vaccine and can say it was the worst workout.  I couldn’t lift very light weights and I was trying my absolute hardest to do so. A week later still the same.,mxmu2r,2021-04-25 19:58:56
"Thanks for sharing! A week out, I wouldn't be too worried. I was noticeably fatigued from the immediate effects for well over a week. I'm more concerned for people going on several weeks+ with lingering fatigue, weakness, or other weirdness",mxmu2r,2021-04-25 16:39:19
Interesting! Keep me updated if the feeling continues if you don't mind. Haven't found too many people with weakness issues as long as I've had them going.,mxmu2r,2021-04-25 20:37:19
Second moderna shot - Day 3 for me and I couldn’t do power walk at 3.3 (I normally run and talk on 5.4 without issues)today on the treadmill without running out of breath and weird body sensation... then that caused panic attack... I hope all this passes soon so I can go back to living life ...,mxmu2r,2021-04-27 01:36:11
If it has only been three days you don't have much to worry about yet. Start worrying when it's been longer than three weeks of continued effects.,mxmu2r,2021-04-27 21:22:03
So weird I had that after my 1st shot!,mxspj5,2021-04-24 23:35:38
Same!,mxspj5,2021-04-25 01:59:09
I have this ... after second. It is everywhere and only goes away on prednisone and then returns.,mxspj5,2021-04-25 14:47:49

I had joint pain too with my first shot. Lasted 6 days. It’s been 11 days and I’m ok now. It beats having Covid but I totally understand your fear of long term because I worry years from now we will start hearing of long term Covid and vaccine side effects. I feel like I have no other choice but to get it because I don’t want to get Covid. Shit sucks,mxk83e,2021-04-24 16:08:25
"The way I look at it I'd rather be laid up in bed for a few days then be hooked to a ventilator.

"I had bad arm pain and some joint pain.  I couldn't dress myself arm pain.  Had other symptoms too, the first dose sucked.  Whenever I get nervous I just think what covid could have done to me!  If I feel like this after a vaccine imagine how bad the joint pain all other symptoms could have been.

I'm 3 weeks post first shot and have been waking up with foot and ankle pain for the last 2 weeks. Never in my life has this bothered me before. Really hope this goes away.,mxkrvv,2021-04-25 23:37:07
Ugh 3 weeks out and I’m still stiff and feel achy all over ... not a fan at all :-(,mxkrvv,2021-04-26 05:25:34

Are you able to see a doc? I’ve seen another post similar to yours and i have to wonder if it’s autoimmune related,mxkrvv,2021-04-30 04:24:41
So I woke up feeling normal today. Finally. 24 days after the 2nd shot. Hoping your symptoms are subsiding as well,mxkrvv,2021-05-03 15:09:59
Well I guess we are SOL on getting an answer here lol,mxkrvv,2021-04-24 23:05:32
I haven't. I was hoping it would go away but it hasn't and now I'm thinking it's time.,mxkrvv,2021-04-30 13:26:07
I guess lol maybe not so common,mxkrvv,2021-04-24 23:20:06

"May have an infection at the injection site, this is actually somewhat common.   I used to give allergy injections (among other things) for several years, so I have some knowledge of these things.  Probably best to call docs office, they may have you go in and check it out/they may not.  If it’s warm to the touch or red, that’s another good indicator.

"I had late onset side effects with the first dose.  Felt a little exhausted for a day and then nothing,  so I thought everything was alright.  Almost a week later,  I felt awful.

"1st shot was a breeze, only had a sore arm, just wait til you get the second one though, I had gotten my second one early in the morning and was fine all day, until around 12:00PM, I started with chills and later got a fever, followed by extreme fatigue.

I had mine at 4pm wed. Arm wasn’t sore as long as the first but I scrubbed bathtubs with it and  it helped I think .  I started to feel  tired around 10  then muscle and joint pain achy fevers couldn’t sleep just hell. it felt like the flu but I took nothing thinking I wasn’t supposed too.  I thought damn I can’t imagine what Covid feels like this is awful. Finally about 6 am I took Advil and finally slept.  Then later that night I felt a lot better it really sucked. 24 hours it was over,mx7rit,2021-04-24 07:52:15
Moving your arm and putting cold wet cloths on it will help ease the soreness. Got my second shot yesterday and it’s more sore than the first so I’m doing those things. Actually I’m using a cold pack because wet? Nah. Lol But that is the official recommendation and I’m not a doctor.,mx7rit,2021-04-24 19:01:59

I’m still really tired because of the meds I took to fall asleep, but other than that I’m feeling pretty normal. Arm is sore again, probably just because I wasn’t moving it around or stretching while I was sleeping.

My appetite has dramatically decreased and my desire for sweets and heavy/greasy foods also. Also have slight nausea on and off since having it.,mxaa7w,2021-04-24 16:40:28

You’ll most likely be fine :)",mx9af2,2021-04-24 02:02:33
I couldn’t agree more this is exactly how I saw it and I’m sure a lot of Americans saw it. Personally my second shot side effects sucked ass but I kept saying “it’s better than a ventilator” overall going through feeling icky to not be in the ICU was worth it.

Don’t label yourself and just listen to ur intuition. If something feels off about it then honor that. Only do what u are comfortable with and don’t let peer pressure make this decision for you.

Give it 1 min massage to your arm and even the shot itself feels lighter.",mx9af2,2021-04-24 11:06:36
"What was weird is that my arm felt fine for most of the day of the shot.. the soreness came on at least 10 hours later for me. I wasn't tense at all or anything, I'm fine with needles.

Anyways, I have anxiety issues, I wouldn't worry about the first shot. I got mine on wednesday at 1:30, and I just had a lot of fatigue and mild body aches. A mild headache developed thursday morning which got worse throughout the day, I had to take tylenol to help me sleep thursday night since the headache got worse. Headache went away on friday, body aches and fatigue persisted. Right now at around 9am saturday morning I'm feeling more normal. I went with tylenol to help me sleep because I wasn't sure if a nsaid like ibuprofen would make the vaccine less effective. (This is after the first shot)",mx9af2,2021-04-24 13:52:37
All I got was a sore arm for both shots. Dont worry about it. Most people get nothing but a sore arm.,mx9af2,2021-04-24 20:55:07
"If you’re worried about possible side effects, the vaccine sites are pretty much a make shift hospital that have everything needed to handle any possible emergency including paramedics, nurses, doctors, and an ambulance on site ready to go. 

If you’re worried about being sick.. plan for the worst. Plan on having a bad flu for that will probably last 12hrs, but take 24hrs to fully feel recovered. Buy Tylenol, a thermometer, soup, Gatorade, and some ice packs to put on your head and neck if you spike a fever. Pick out some movies or series and set up shop on a couch or bed.

"This happened to me too... starting about four days after my 2nd dose of Moderna. (The first dose made me feel uncharacteristically mellow, but not depressed). I too am really outgoing and never depressed.  


 I got my 2nd dose five weeks ago and the depression is just about gone, thank God. I am very pro-vaccine, thankful to have it, and would/will do it again in a heartbeat (ie, I will get the booster when they have it against variants and so on). I am thankful and relieved to be fully vaccinated. But I DID experience that depression which is something I've never experienced due to any life circumstances or other reasons, before.   


I am still more tired than usual, need more sleep, and a bit brain fogged.   


I figure these are all effects that the VIRUS causes, and it would be so much worse to experience this from the virus instead of the much milder version from the vaccine.   


I'm interested to hear that you are normally upbeat too because that's me to a T... cheerful even when there's no good reason to be, lol. And this changed that. But I am getting my old self back.   


What has helped me has been those mushroom coffees and hot cocoas with Ashwaganda, Reishi, etc. They seem to be helping me get my system back into balance. They are from a company called Foursigmatic. I tend to react strongly to medications and things... and I gave up coffee 11 years ago. But I needed a boost after the shot. I'm not a doctor and I can't/won't/don't give medical advice, I'm just sharing that this worked for me and I am feeling like my old self again in terms of the depression. Still a bit tired, need to rest more. But thankful to have immunity and not be dealing with whatever version of this stuff the actual VIRUS doles out.",mx2nnv,2021-05-06 05:05:23

Why would this vaccine cause spleen inflammation? Can anyone on here that’s a Dr. explain this. Also for them to tell you “call Moderna” and Moderna to say “consult your Dr.” is frustrating as fuck. I would demand answers.,mx3fvk,2021-04-23 21:06:19
"Wow. This is the first thread I’ve seen with enlarged spleen. I had the same thing happen. I had pain in my spleen within day after first shot. I got lab work and it had some interesting results. And spleen feeling hasn’t resolved (though my eye spasm and other symptoms have) so i have been debating if I should get abdominal ultrasound before my next shot. Which, le sigh, is tomorrow.  I feel better knowing this is perhaps a possible side effect though (or I guess it could be coincidental in both of us?). I had had high elevated white blood cell count and other markers (in addition to pain in upper left quadrant) and was worried I might be fighting an unrelated infection, in which case I wasn’t sure if I should overtax my immune system? It is frustrating that everyone seems to be guessing (docs say ask the manufacturer and manufacturer says ask the docs) at this point but I guess that is best we can hope for given the circumstances and need to expedite time to market.",mx3fvk,2021-04-23 22:03:31

Did this resolve on its own for you?",mx3fvk,2021-05-22 05:31:30
The way it was explained to me was that your spleen plays an important role in your immune system so it’s entirely possible since I had a dramatic response (feeling ill for 10 days) that my spleen overreacted as well. My doctors said it’s not unusual for your spleen to get enlarged from various bacterial or viral infections.,mx3fvk,2021-04-23 21:12:33

Oh well this makes sense. I guess I get caught up in the “vaccine causes x” when the issues is really your immune system causes x it seems. I wonder if your second dose would be easier for you because your body’s already made these antigens what’s a few more. That said I’m an IDIOT so idk.,mx3fvk,2021-04-23 21:20:00
"I understand that everyone has different reactions, but remember that people are far more likely to share a bad reaction than a good one. I was scared, too, but got my second dose two days ago and feel totally fine. Zero side effects. My first shot I got pretty bad chills the first night, and a really sore arm. I did windmills this time, and no soreness, not tired, nothing. I know others who had no side effects from second dose, also. My son for one. He got his second dose the same day as me, and we keep comparing notes. “Still nothing.” “Same.”",mx8c78,2021-04-24 01:22:34
"I’m more than two weeks out from my second dose. Spent a day with a large headache and a stomachache. Then it was gone. 40F. 

Just remember. People who don’t have side effects often don’t post on the internet. The stories you read here are most always going to be more people who were miserable - not everyone gets that. Be fully vaccinated, it’s worth it!",mx8c78,2021-04-24 03:06:44
I am 2 weeks afyer my 2nd shot of Moderna and its been fine.,mx8c78,2021-04-24 01:31:00
"Hell YEAH!!!! GET THAT SHOT 

COVID SUCKEDDDDDDDD and I mean if you had a ok time with covid (or bad time) you’ll get through this. It’s probably gonna be AT MOST 48 hours of being tired. Maybe fever. 

But you’re a WINNER AND YOU GOT THIS. GET AN ICECREAM SANDWICH, COZY UP WITH NETFLIX AND GET! THAT! SHOT! 

(And then when it sucks you can come complain to us but I promise the worst symptoms aren’t too bad because it’s not long term. I’ll admit, I had a 103 fever which was worse that when I got covid, but I was back into action 36 hours later jogging and happy to be vaccinated, you got this! It’s worth it ☺️)",mx8c78,2021-04-24 03:25:03
"I just got the second shot yesterday, for context I’m 23m and have asthma too.  I got my shot at 12pm and the arm soreness started around 4 hours later and by night time I had this really intense sleepiness, like I took a Benadryl.  I woke up at least 10 times throughout the night and I had chills and muscle aches.  It honestly kind of sucked.

But it’s now 32 hours after my shot and feel totally normal now other than some residual tiredness and some arm soreness.",mx8c78,2021-04-24 02:23:07
I’m pretty worried too.. idk I wish these people posting these things were getting answers so we could ALL get answers. It feels like a lot of these things are being dismissed and THAT is what is making me hesitant. I got the first vaccine thinking everything would be ok but I feel so hurt for all these people and just want to know that these companies and doctors actually care about what’s happening.,mx8c78,2021-04-24 01:11:45
"Yes, I got my second shot today, (8 hours ago).  Right now my only side effects are a stiff arm and a slight headache.  I’ve been drinking a ton of water and taking ibuprofen.   I also took one of those airborne tablets to boost my immune system.",mx8c78,2021-04-24 02:25:18
I canceled my second appointment,mx8c78,2021-04-24 19:35:14
I got my first dose today and I’m contemplating the second one as well,mx8c78,2021-04-24 01:19:24
"Of course, everyone will say yes you need to get the 2nd and I do understand of course but I’m so hesitant because the data and side effects seem to be all over the place. I really want to second but I’m also worried about getting actual help and answers if something does happen post vaccine.",mx8c78,2021-04-24 01:14:20
I was scared of shot 2. I have a lot of health anxiety. I was convinced I would have terrible side effects. However the day after I only got a low grade fever and joint pain. I took Tylenol and it made me feel immediately better. It’s been over a week and feel back to normal and even biked 14 miles today no sweat. You will do fine. And you’ll emerge with antibodies that will protect you and your community. It’s so worth it and I’m glad I did it.,mx8c78,2021-04-24 04:50:03
"It’ll be fine. I had zero symptoms second shot. For every 1 bad experience you read there is 50 that were fine, but most ppl aren’t gonna take the time to post that their experience was uneventful.  Don’t sweat it.",mx8c78,2021-04-24 09:52:52
"I’m going to get royally harassed for this but *for ME, ime* I wish I skipped it altogether, especially the second one. I had late onset sickness with the first dose that lasted another week or so. Pain, migraine, nausea. I had the second one Wednesday and have had a migraine since Thursday morning that has made my left eye feel on the verge of popping out, dizziness and weird malaise again but about twice as bad. 

Oh, and both my sister and brother in law got covid after they were vaccinated anyway.",mx8c78,2021-04-24 11:10:17
"So TRUE! YAS! I had side effects and it was worth it. But MOST my friends didn’t have any issues. A few got brain fog and like 3 of us stayed in bed a day. Like I was 100% out of commission after both my shots but it was WORTH IT 1,000% 

I’d DO IT AGAIN! 

Glad you’re feeling good too!!!!",mx8c78,2021-04-24 03:31:14
This response made me irrationally happy :’),mx8c78,2021-04-24 04:02:45
"I had a bad reaction to both shots and had covid a few months prior. I had a 103 fever, I didn’t sleep just one night, brain fog, headache. 

But it was SO WORTH IT. it only lasted a little while. Tylenol kept me ok. And now I’m vaccinated. I got to hug my parents who were vaccinated. I hope to never get covid again and I had a mild case. So anything to help stop the spread. 

It’s worth it. You’re strong enough to do it! 🥰",mx8c78,2021-04-24 03:29:17
contemplating. first shot went ok - just aches. but i keep hearing bad things about Moderna 2nd shot. think I might ask my doctor if I can wait for awhile and then take Pfizer which sounds less bad.,mx8c78,2021-04-25 16:27:15
14 miles is 22.53 km,mx8c78,2021-04-24 04:50:24
"I’m glad <3 

I got my second shot and 3 weeks later got to hug my parents. 11/10 totally worth the awful fever for for a few hours 🥰 sending well wishes to you",mx8c78,2021-04-24 08:14:01
It doesn’t help stop the spread though. You can literally still get and transmit covid. You just (probably) won’t die.,mx8c78,2021-04-24 11:05:54
Oh! I thought it helped slow the spread somewhat- i know they are still researching it but i heard it’s a little helpful. I mean I’m still double masking it because we don’t know——but to be able to see my parents who also got vaccinated was AWESOME. And to feel better about working and see vaccinated friends with a little less stress is really dope!!!,mx8c78,2021-04-24 16:34:08
I’ve seen a few people post about this.. I wonder why this happens. Did you have a fever?,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 00:30:31
Do you have a history of anxiety / pschycosis?,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 01:21:50
I had extremely lucid dreams following my 2nd dose... not necessarily hallucinations but definitely something weird with my psyche.,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 16:25:44
I was asleep after the first dose and I hallucinated a hand reaching into my room and looking for the light switch. Just remembered this after seeing this post.,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 03:51:57
No hallucinations but I felt high as a kite with both doses. That has happened to me with other vaccines too.,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 04:59:49
About 6 hours after second dose I kept thinking I saw something weird out of the corner of my eye and quickly looked but nothing was there. Only happened a few times and chalked it up to my imagination and being tired. No fever.,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 09:52:39
I had vivid dreams and fever day dreams / half sleep dreams but not what I’d call a hallucination. Todays the dirst day I’ve felt normal since shot on Monday. Still would not hesitate,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 18:02:05
"My friend’s relative got covid and had to be treated for covid psychosis. He became paranoid of flying to Florida on a family trip, couldn’t go to work, crying and hallucinating. This person never had any symptoms like this before. He is in his late 40s, married with 2 children. He had to be treated by a psychiatrist. 

Your mind is a powerful organ and with anything foreign could possibly trigger something like hallucinations. Hopefully, it will subside and you will start to feel better. Praying for you!",mx3jfz,2021-04-24 18:03:34
"No hallucinations but I was so sweaty, tired and feverish that I felt delirious! I fell asleep at 6pm after a full day of horrible nausea/fever and my husband woke me up at 8:30 and I had absolutely no recollection falling asleep!

I second the person who said it made me feel high! Just so out of it!",mx3jfz,2021-05-06 19:23:42
"Yes i had minor fever nothing heavy, chills, body ache, headache in the back of the head, sensitive skin and touch,  fatigue, nausea,confusion at times or a bit like foggy thoughts, loss of appetite too. the headache isn’t too severe i have migraines so my pain tolerance is high.",mx3jfz,2021-04-24 00:35:44
No never had any mental problems or anything related to that. This would be the first time this ever happen,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 01:22:36
5 minutes after leaving the clinic from getting the 2nd dose i got the car and was about to put reverse when i saw a human like figure standing next to the driver window i freak out and that when I got confused and wasn’t sure what had happen until the 2nd incident where i look over and saw my arm been bloody,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 04:36:28
So you didn’t have hallucinations or you were just wondering,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 01:12:45
I really hope this isn’t a new thing then cuz I just got my first dose today and I have a history of both and now I’m regretting my decision 😂🥴,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 01:23:30
Have you ever experienced a hallucination before? Mine only happen when I’m in REM and somehow awaken like sleep paralysis.,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 04:45:50
"I had a few hallucinations, hard to describe but i do remember looking over to the arm where i got the vaccine shot and i saw that it was cover in blood you could see the bright red color and felt realistic i look away and back to the same arm and it was gone",mx3jfz,2021-04-24 01:19:57
"I hope not lol i do know everyone has different symptoms, all my co workers already got the 2nd dose and some just got like a fever or flu like symptoms for a day or 2",mx3jfz,2021-04-24 01:25:11
"No never, yesterday after i left the clinic it was the first  time i ever experience something like",mx3jfz,2021-04-24 04:47:13
Ugh :( I guess I just want to understand why this is happening,mx3jfz,2021-04-24 01:29:02
"Yes, i would also like to know why it happen, i had no luck when i was searching on that topic, i did find out that some people  who had catch covid did have some hallucinations but then again it was not related to the vaccine",mx3jfz,2021-04-24 02:05:17
"Well, I heard the hallucinations were from the fever but you didn’t seem to have one that high and a lot of other people I’ve spoken to with hallucinations said they didn’t have a fever or not a high one but they were hit with hallucinations. Like I’m really wondering WHY?? Also, don’t forget to call and report this side effect to the cdc and to moderna",mx3jfz,2021-04-24 02:08:59
"Just got my first one a few days ago. I had the exact same symptoms but with some more arm pain and slight neck tightness.

Not a scientist but I would think by 10 days your body has made a fair amount of antibodies and you are pretty protected. I don't think it waits til 14 days and pumps them all out at once.,mx4l65,2021-04-24 00:58:46
Definitely! They say it takes 14 days but for the second dose I think it’s less.,mx4l65,2021-04-23 23:17:46
It might be? I got my first shot 10 days ago and got a canker sore and a cold sore,mx7roe,2021-04-24 01:01:09
"I noticed after my second shot all the areas of my body that have previously been injured became sore and inflamed. I have a previously broken heel bone and a torn hip and both of them were throbbing with pain for a few days. 
My husband typically experiences illnesses differently than me. Where I have muscle aches and back pain, he usually experience has more stomach problems. Anyway, he threw up the night he got the vaccine and was completely sick to his stomach and no appetite for several days after. What I’m trying to say is that if you have a weakness i.e. shingles lurking in your body, it’s going to come out when you’re immune system is busy with making antibodies to respond to the vaccine.",mx7roe,2021-04-24 01:19:09

The crazy thing was, at like the 3 week mark, my lymph node just went down randomly over the course of like ten minutes, then my tinnitus stopped the next day, then my nose was back to normal the day after.

I could barely even notice the shot when I got it, and it’s only for 2-3 seconds. The shot didn’t hurt! I would recommend doing some deep breathing, listen to calming/enjoyable music, bring along a buddy, and think of the many benefits you’ll get from the vaccine.",mwxwxl,2021-04-23 22:51:51

"39F here. I’ve led a boring life working as a civ clerk for my state police. I have however had foot surgery, whiplash and a few other general aches and pains. I was fully vaccinated on March 12th and for a few days after my vaccine, everywhere that I had been injured or had surgery ached. It wasn’t horrendous but like a pain that wouldn’t go away. Ironically though, my c-section scar didn’t hurt. But my neck, back and foot all hurt for a few days. Very odd. I didn’t any of that to my shot until about a week later when I saw someone else post about that too. 

Glad you’re doing better and thank you so much for your service! You make our continued freedoms possible and so many take that for granted.",mwosdv,2021-04-24 02:05:16

"20M, we have stronger immune systems so we're more likely to have nasty first dose reactions and mild second ones.

Like a really nasty flu, but it only lasted 24 hours.",mx11jk,2021-04-24 02:02:20

"Yes. Had second shot Wednesday at 1pm. Felt fine until about 3pm yesterday then had body aches, severe shivering and had the worst night in years. Fever dreams suck. We are reprogramming our phone tree at work and I had literally 8 hours of semi-lucid dreams about people getting the wrong extensions and calls getting lost. Over and over and over.

When I tried to sleep it was somewhat difficult but when I did I was especially transported to a different life? It felt like I was dreaming for a week and what added to that was how realistic the dream was, I even slept within the dream. When I woke up, I had the feeling of embarrassment because in the dream I was drinking, so I woke up with the expectation to delete all my Instagram posts but that's when it hit me I was dreaming this entire thing.",mwt4jc,2021-04-26 14:50:26

"If you're young (or if you had covid previously), you have a much more violent immune response to these sorts of things. I know like 3 people under the age of 25, including me, who had pretty much the exact response as you. Fortunately, since you got all your reacting done on the first dose, the second dose is much more likely to give you a good time.

Headaches are still mostly a mystery to us. One of my family members sees a neurologist regularly and takes daily meds to combat migraines. I hope that helps! I also recommend seeing a chiropractor. Another member of my family has crazy headaches randomly from neck vertebrae getting moved out of place. All the time. Chiropractor is amazing. Maybe the vaccine messed with your muscles enough to pull your neck out of alignment badly. That can put some people in the hospital. Others wouldn't even notice. Get well soon!,mwszs2,2021-04-23 14:15:24
"Hi! So, I'm getting ready to post pretty much the same thing as you. I am now 9 days out after the first shot, my symptoms really kicked in 7 days after the second dose. Here is a breakdown. I want to share too and learn if anyone is else is having these same things. thank you so much for sharing your story. It's the only one other than my own that I've found. 

33female, I'm healthy, workout several times a week, rarely get sick, and i've never had an issue with headaches or migraines. After the second shot of Moderna I've had a headache that won't go away. Here's my timeline and it sounds really similar to yours...

04/14 1pm Second shot of Moderna 

04/15 mild headache, muscle soreness/aches - felt like I had done a normal weight lifting or hiit workout, just a little sore, brain fog

04/16 mild headache but no soreness, brain fog still there

04/17-04/20 headache would usually come in the evening, brain fog all day. I'm a musician and I teach chemistry at the college level, my brain was just not quite there for anything.

04/21 onset of extreme exhaustion at 3pm, took a 30 min nap, THEN the fun began. The left side of my face began to swell up and my headache and pressure in my face started to get worse. Called nurse who suggested I go to the ER. ER found no blood clot or anything serious. 

04/22 headache, pressure in my face, cheek muscles feel really weird (probably from swelling the day before) + new light sensitivity. Called doctor who explained how to properly drink water and take pain meds BAHAHAHHA. No shit. This has nothing to do with dehydration. 

04/22: took some Benadryl  slept from 5PM - 7AM, 14h:)

04/23: Not feeling much better. No apparent swelling in face like on 4/21. However, my face feels weird and my muscles in my face seem fatigued. Headache is bad and very sensitive to light. I've never experienced anything like this. Brain fog is still here.",mwszs2,2021-04-23 16:26:15
I have had the same symptoms and finally your the first on here with the same. Im 14 days from second vaccine and have the exact same symptoms and have been to the ER 2 times and now a neurologist next week. They started me on steroids for the next 6 days and it seems to be helping so far. Weirdly enough i started having pain behind my knee of my left leg today and theres just alot going on. I took dayquil the other day to stop the headaches and it worked but my right ear turned hot and red and my right arm was weak which caused my second trip to ER. Ill keep speaking on here im very curious to know what happens with you.,mwszs2,2021-04-23 19:55:46
"Hi there! I am also suffering from debilitating headaches post my second moderna shot. I had the typical side effects the next day (body aches, fever, chills, and mild headache). The next night, I had a headache that stayed with me when I awoke the next morning. I ended having facial pain under my eyes indicative of a sinus headache. I was able to get rid of it with some food, Tylenol, and coffee. 

Over the next couple of days I had headaches that came and went. Seven days later from my shot, I started to have pressure in my left temple. It then evolved to both of my temples and then the center of my head. It moves around and is occasionally accompanied by throbbing. 13 days later, I’m still suffering from this. No otc medicines have helped...I’ve taken Tylenol, Sudafed, and Allegra (I’m a tree pollen allergy sufferer). 

I ended up going to the ER and got a CT scan and other tests that came out clear. I was advised to see a neurologist. Trying to get an appointment has been a literal nightmare but I was able to snag one and hopefully I get some promising answers and some relief!!! 

I was going to post about this but saw this post and figured I’d chime in. I hope we all get relief ASAP. This is nerve wracking, literally. I started to have other neurological symptoms as well as this has gone on and it’s scary. I was a little hesitant about getting a vaccine that was fast tracked instead of the standard years long process, but I weighed the risks of what I knew and decided to go for it. I never heard of this type of reaction though. I kind of feel bamboozled. Certainly not even considering boosters at this point in my vaccine journey, which sucks because I am not anti-vaxx by any means.

Also — no neurological reaction after my first shot; only a sore arm. I almost wish I only had the first shot. What a trick! lol",mwszs2,2021-04-23 23:30:21
Which vaccine did you receive?,mwszs2,2021-04-23 13:03:36
"I've been having severe bloating and back pain since my 2nd dose on the 15th. It's so frustrating! Im so sorry, OP. I hope you start feeling better!",mwszs2,2021-04-25 18:25:26
"For anyone following I wanted to provide an update.  I am now 27 days after second moderne dose.  38F, white, no previous history of headaches or migraines.  I have been experiencing a migraine since the second dose on 4/2.

I have been managing the pain with Tylenol and 600mg of ibuprofen throughout the day.  Benadryl and melatonin at night to sleep more than 5 hours. Headache moves around the head, no singular spot and no consistency other than the felling of pressure.  Sometimes throbbing and I can feel my pulse in my head.  Pain level fluctuates between a 4-9, light and sound sensitive.  My PCP did give propranolol which is a preventative that takes 2-3 weeks to kick in.  I have been taking 40mg 12 hours apart twice daily.

I saw a neurologist on Tuesday and came out with information and options but no real solution.  Being that this is my first experience with headaches and how far in I am not a lot that can be done other than manage the pain and hope that this is a one time thing.  He did say that there have been cases they are aware of where the vaccine triggered a very long migraine for some.  So, you are all validated.  The cognitive issues I am having with memory recall is normal given the amount of pain.  He recommended a course of IV drugs at the ER to knock it out and to check in in 4-6 weeks, keep a headache diary.

Last night I went to the ER to do the IV drugs.  I didn’t take any OTC meds to get a baseline and it was a 10 pain level after waiting to be seen for 2 hours.  They gave the following.  Toradol, Benadryl, and Reglan.  That knocked it to a 5.  Then they added Haldol and magnesium and that knocked it down to a 1.  They released me and I slept like a baby last night.  

This morning I feel much better pain is a 2.  Pressure but no light/sound sensitivity and for the first time I feel ok to drive in 3 weeks.  For those of you managing with self care, I would recommend a combination of magnesium and Riboflaven(B2).  Neurologist recommended to keep at bay long term.  I will update in a week, hopefully this is the end of it!",mwszs2,2021-04-29 13:44:29
I haven't been able to sleep since my second dose 6 days ago as well as headaches even though I super weird( like once a yea) to have one,mwszs2,2021-04-29 17:59:55
"Just scrolling through your post here. Any update? I'm also experiencing the same symptoms after my 1st dose. I haven't been to ER yet, I may have to go tomorrow if I can't sleep again. Thanks for posting such detail it really helped alleviate some of my anxieties",mwszs2,2021-05-08 01:51:16

"Ok, THANK YOU so much for this.  I feel really alone with this, and am super irritated with how dismissive everyone has been.  I’m not crazy, I’m not a hypochondriac, I know how to drink water and I’ve taken every over-the-counter measure available. I’ve seen a chiropractor and massage therapist, my primary care physician twice. The fact that I had to take a leave from work because I can’t think properly should be red flags enough for these doctors.  Please, let’s keep each other updated?",mwszs2,2021-04-23 16:30:29
"I (32 M) am experiencing a recurring afternoon onset of headache, despite never having challenges with headache, and am 11 days past my second shot. I had a wild ride beginning the night after my second dose. I felt phenomenal 3 days later, and the recurring headaches came about day 6 or 7.

It’s not debilitating but has me feeling irritable. My bio is similar to yours with nutrition and regular exercise.

I appreciate your sharing and am throwing myself in the group here. I hope y’all find peace or resolution. I am pretty optimistic that this will pass. But optimism isn’t enough. Hoping you find answers!",mwszs2,2021-04-23 21:55:04

"I really appreciate you sharing this.  It seems there are a handful of us experiencing these long lasting effects.  

My headaches go from a pain level from 4 to 8 without warning.  Makes my eyes water and I have light and auditory sensitivity.  Nothing really helps except ice packs on my head, heat on my neck, and laying down.  That makes it more tolerable but by no means fixes. It’s in my temples and all around my whole head.  Like this ring of pressure.  When it gets really bad it throbs and I can feel my pulse in my whole head.

The thing that scares me the most is the inability to process information quickly, or at all.  Like I get stuck or make a ton of mistakes.  Like if you asked me directions to get somewhere I can’t piece it together.  I work in a really fast paced environment and have a team of 35 people.  I’m unable to work in this capacity.  Thankfully I work for a great company that has allowed me to take time off.",mwszs2,2021-04-24 00:16:37

"OMG! Right!? We know how to freaking drink water and take over the counter pain meds. 

Please please let's keep eachother updated. 

Honestly, knowing that I'm not alone in this just raised my spirits a little bit. 

I'm going to try and rest again today and try to go to bed early and take some more benadryl. I'm hoping if I can get another night of good sleep, then maybe I'll feel better. 

I do have an appt with my normal doc on Tuesday morning - she's good about diving in and trying to think of different solutions. I'll let you know what she says. 

I'm just wondering if our body's immune system is freaking out a bit. 

This combo of headache/light sensitivity/brain fog is something I've never experienced. I've been sick before with a cold or what have you, but this is NOT me being 'sick'. This feels wayyy different.",mwszs2,2021-04-23 16:34:52
"Hey, thanks for sharing. OK, so right now we have me, 33F, the original poster, 38F, and you 32M... seems like this effect is occurring at the 30's stage haha

Do you have any brain fog? I think that's the thing that has me most frustrated. I'm a musician and chemist and I can tell that I'm not all there. 

I'm optimistic like you. I'm hopeful I'll bounce back by taking off this weekend and just relax. I stay pretty busy, so this will be a change. lol",mwszs2,2021-04-23 22:06:07

"My mental agility is not sharp, but not particularly sluggish. The afternoon headache has me less mentally agile, sure, but I don’t know that I would describe it is a brain fog, no.

The CDC just gave a green light to the re authorization of Johnson and Johnson vaccine, with near 2 in a million blood clotting cases amongst women. Headache or stomach ache (beginning?) 7 days after the second shot may have been a preceding symptom to the clot.

The advice being issued is to be aware of the chance for clot and to see a physician following the above symptoms.

I appreciate y’all are seeing the physicians and nothing is coming of it. Bummer.

I have been furious with the lack of centrist conversation on the topic of vaccines. Any discussion of skepticism puts one in the anti vaccine camp. Absolutely unproductive.

Do you happen to have anxiety? Might be due to that. I experienced some shortness of breath the first 2 weeks after my first shot (just got my second one a few hours ago) and I’m pretty sure mine was due to that. But I also know that I have a history with (health) anxiety.,mwpouz,2021-04-23 15:57:43
"I have asthma that’s usually triggered by intense exercise, and an autoimmune disease. For about two weeks after my first dose my asthma was acting up, to the point I started carrying my inhaler around and I never needed to do that before. Because my immune system is a dope and attacks itself, I did fully expect to have an even worse response though tbh. So far this week I’ve felt fine and haven’t needed to use my inhaler at all. I’m scheduled to get my second dose next week. Do you have asthma or anything?",mwpouz,2021-04-23 10:28:41
"Democrats say “my body, my choice” for pregnant women that want abortions (which by the way I fully support).

"I don’t have any diagnosed anxiety, I have had some times fairly recently where I know I was pretty anxious (e.g. I had convinced myself I had cancer, turns out I didn’t, although in my defense the doc thought there was a fair chance it was cancer), and haven’t had this type of reaction from it",mwpouz,2021-04-23 21:49:49

"Convincing yourself you have cancer (or any other serious illness) is typical for health anxiety. Been there… Shortness of breath can be a typical symptom when anxiety rises. It can also be a vicious circle, where one experiences a (normal/harmless/random) symptom which leads to anxiety and more awareness and thus to more/stronger symptoms and so on. 

Of course, this doesn’t have to be the case for you. If you feel like something serious is up consider calling your doctor. But maybe think about it and be aware in the future if any symptoms (and possible diseases you think they’re from) are infact harmless and worsened through anxiety. Hope you feel better soon!",mwpouz,2021-04-23 22:13:04
"the (potential) mental and (definite) physical stress on your body (from dealing with the antigens introduced) probably caused your cycle to go off/symptoms to worsen.

I received my 2nd dose of Moderna on April 15th. I am so so grateful for it! I did start my period that same night and it was much heavier and more painful than usual. But it only lasted 4 days. I'm still having some weird cramping and back pain however and it has been 8 days. I can't say for sure if it's vaccine related and I'll definitely be getting the booster shot if they have one in the Fall. But I have been seeing a lot of these posts. Definitely interested if there's any relation.,mwlhv5,2021-04-24 00:45:52

in what study? anecdotal evidence reported by a news site is not proof.,mwlhv5,2021-04-23 04:28:45
I’d have to find it but my doctor said that it’s likely an inflammatory response to the vaccine but it isn’t linked directly to the vaccine but to the response.,mwlhv5,2021-04-23 04:37:45

"Not with amount of salt I eat. :) But yes, don’t guzzle 10 liters in one sitting, friends. You want to drink some, then take a break. Eat a little something. Drink some more, etc. 

I normally drink 5 liters of water a day, so doubling that amount took a litylr effort, but it was manageable. And then I drank a full bottle of Gatorade (which has electrolytes and sugar in it). 

If you are concerned, please eat something with salt in it while you are drinking extra water. The danger is guzzling a bunch of water and messing up your electrolyte balance — but it would have to be a lot of water in a very short amount of time. 

Space it out. My vaccine appointment was at 1:45 pm. I started drinking water at 6 am when I got up, so I did it over an almost 8 hour period.

I did a few things differently the second time around:

1. I hydrated for a few days before hand, intentionally drinking much more water than usual.

2. I did windmills with my arm intermittently in the hours following the shot and the next day which reduced (but did not eliminate) the sore arm.

3. Took a sleep aid the first night.

4. Took advil once I started to feel discomfort (prob 5 hours or so after). Last time I didn't take anything until the day after, but that felt like torture.

I think a lot of people haven’t really had to deal with illness all that much, to be honest, so having a fever or aches is really uncomfortable for them. Most people have hardly any side effects.

"Stop getting your information from Facebook memes. Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, has gotten his Pfizer vaccine. He originally said that he did not want to get it at first because he was in much better shape to handle COVID-19 compared to individuals that are unhealthy or have illnesses that make them vulnerable to the virus. [(Source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/03/30/fact-check-pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-received-covid-19-vaccine/7028843002/)

As far as the booster shot, it’s not sure just yet whether booster shots will be needed. The reason why a booster shot may be needed is because viruses can mutate. It’s simple science. A booster shot can help protect against new strains of COVID-19 as they “refresh” your immune system and rearm your while blood cells on how to attack the virus. [(Source)](https://time.com/5955500/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shot/)

As far as “when did they start caring about my health,” maybe they began caring when people were dying from of COVID-19 complications? This isn’t just America, this has happened to numerous countries around the world. 

The side effects you’re reading from this subreddit tend to be askew. Some people (like you) purposely seek out this subreddit to post bogus shit. What you’re missing is the many people that get the vaccine and do not have crazy side effects. I know of many. They’re not going to flood to this subreddit just to post “Everything went well!” Many people come here because they are nervous, which is fair. As far as your twenty year old friends, I’m happy that they recovered well. But you forget of individuals whose parents, friends, and grandparents have died from the virus. 
I also have twenty year old friends that have gotten COVID-19, and while they may have recovered, some of them have developed long-term illnesses since having the virus.",mwjbj2,2021-04-23 19:08:06
"Hope you feel better soon. I've read if you have a bad first shot, your second one will probably be easier. Not sure if that's true or not.",mwlz99,2021-04-23 20:57:18
"I (20M) had a nasty 102 degree fever after the first dose, my second dose was way better. I just had a low fever for like 6 hours max, then felt like I got beat up the next day, and felt fine the day after that.",mwlz99,2021-04-24 02:12:33
"Not likely, from what I understand.  Most get ill with the second shot because your body has been exposed and now knows how to fight it, but since you had it already, your body treated the sickness like the first exposure and the shot like the second exposure.

Your second shot will act like a third exposure...which will cause some reaction, but by then you’ll be “good” at fighting it.   

Reaction?...yes...but not as severe as the first shot.  You’ve been through the worst already.",mwbz2i,2021-04-22 20:03:15
"I had Covid. 1st shot side effects were WAAAAAAY worse than the 2nd shot. I'm 5 days post-Dose 2. The only real side effect I had was a fever at about 36 hours in. A few aches and pains. Some fatigue, but nothing AT ALL like Dose 1. It was, in a word, fuckinghell. All my Dose 2 side effects are candy compared to Dose 1. Nothing Advil and a little extra sleep can't handle. You'll be a-ok.",mwbz2i,2021-04-22 21:20:55
"I also experienced horrible side effects uncontrollable shaking , high heart rate but I’m so supe scared of being sick as well so I did have anxieties . I’m supposed to go Monday and I’m still debating on going",mwbz2i,2021-04-22 21:52:43
"I had a horrendous experience with my first dose (fever and chills for a night, splitting headaches, persistent fatigue and nausea for a week). I was also very scared for round 2 and only got the second shot because I felt it was my duty to contribute to eradication of covid19. 

I had my second dose on Tuesday afternoon. I had an hour of chills that night but otherwise was a little achy and felt strange. Yesterday, I felt tired all day and didn't do much. Today I feel a little tired but otherwise okay. 

I did a few things differently: 
-I started hydrating 2 days beforehand and kept hydrating after. 
-I took advil a few hours after the shot when a headache started coming on (I know there are mixed reviews about taking advil afterwards, but I was traumatized from the first dose experience and unwilling to suffer like that again - if it reduced my immunity a little bit, oh well).
-I took a sleep aid that night to help me sleep through the night

Note: I have, to my knowledge, never had covid.

Second round might be not as bad. Good luck!!",mwbz2i,2021-04-22 21:20:39
"I had covid back in December and had pretty moderate symptoms. I received both doses and can tell you I had the same reaction after the first dose. I felt run down, fever, body aches. After the second dose I did feel fatigue that night into the next day . Just felt tired and a bit spacey but nothing like after the first dose. Just get lots of rest and stay hydrated and you'll be good . Best of luck!",mwbz2i,2021-04-22 20:48:22
"You should have less problems with the second dose, from what I have read. You can do it.",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 04:48:51
"My second was as terrible as the first one, 103 fever, arm throbbing in pain with no sleep, BUT it was over in 36hours. It does suck, but remember you’re surviving the first dose! You can rant and complain here and we will ALL understand and support you (cause it sucksssssss) and I had covid right before and even though I didn’t get a fever or chills, I’m so glad to maybe be a little more protected from getting it again. Covid SUCKSSSSSSSS (and I had a mild case! Oxygen never dipped below 97%, no fever, complete lost of taste and utter exhaustion)",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 05:13:32
"I have not had Covid to my knowledge but I can agree that 1st shot symptoms were WAY WORSE than 2nd shot symptoms. I had my second shot 3 days ago & I’m feeling fantastic. The worst symptoms so far have been the sore arm, mild joint pain & a headache. All were easily fixed with some advil! Good luck☺️",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 05:32:43
"I was fatigued after my first shot, had a headache and arm pain. I got my second shot yesterday, only had a bit of arm pain and body aches. Took a Tylenol before bed and woke up this morning feeling fine. I did drink a ton of water yesterday and gonna do the same today.",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 15:36:18
"I was pretty scared too.

I found that my second dose was a lot easier than my first.

I had the insane chills too.

Psyching yourself out is only putting stress on your body. 

I highly recommend staying present in the moment and doing breaths.

You will be ok.",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 19:15:25
Just don't get it.,mwbz2i,2021-04-23 02:05:20
"My first shot was a breeze. Second shot was brutal for about a day. Now you had COVID so you took your first shot with the antibodies inside you already. The second shot might not be so bad. Listen your 26. It’s not going to kill you. You might feel crappy fir about a day or so but at your age. Your good. Good luck. Relax,",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 21:22:02
"This is what I have read as well, so your second shot should be better. Make sure to drink A LOT of water the day of and have Tylenol on hand to combat fever. You will be fine.",mwbz2i,2021-04-22 20:43:13
"Mine was the same, but a slightly higher fever, but I don’t regret it one bit! 

Had some Tylenol and wild fever dreams, and just waited it out and tried to think good thoughts. I couldn’t stop crying and laughing hysterically. 10/10 highly recommend even if you’ve had covid and a shitty first shot experience. Sending you well wishes! But the statistics are very true, the second dose might not be as bad in your case!",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 05:16:12
"I was SHOCKED when my symptoms were worse than when I had covid. But like it was quick and I rather go through the shots side effects again rather than covid, that’s for sure. 

I hear you!",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 05:17:22
"You’ve got this. Just think of that sweet immunity, being able to connect with loved ones, and safer travel! 
Not to mention that your full dose vaccine will help protect you against the severe symptoms of COVID-19.",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 18:41:32
Have you decided if you are going to go? Will you keep me updated? :),mwbz2i,2021-04-25 20:23:00
"I appreciate this write up because I just got my first dose on Tuesday and it was hell for me. I went into it thinking I’d be like everyone else and just have some arm pain and feel a little tired. Woke up feeling great, went for my usual morning run, and off to work. 

Around 10AM, arm started hurting more then some light chills. By noon, I wanted to curl up in ball and cry. High fever, sweats, chills, headache, nausea, and my arm felt like it was punched repeatedly by Mike Tyson. It started raining and the rain felt like razor blades hitting me skin. Took Tylenol and a cold bath then hit my bed hard.

Woke up today feeling completely drained and my sheets were soaked from sweating all night long. Also a big red blotch at the injection site, that slowly dissipated throughout the day. 

I’m dreading the 2nd dose, but I feel more confident after reading this and I have no regrets. I would still take the vaccine over again.",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 00:01:12
"I keep seeing this...a ton of people are reporting in on mood swings and feeling “high”.

I got mine about 24 hours ago and the high thing happened to me, along with a little numbing in my shot arm...felt like I had tape on my arm.  A little weird, bit more of a novelty sensation...no actual pain.

I feel for the anxiety crowd.  I hope they remember to remind themselves it’s just the vaccine making them feel down, it’s not real.",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 15:46:52
I haven’t decided yet but I will let you know if I do 😭,mwbz2i,2021-04-25 20:27:38
"Hopefully your second won't be so bad!! It's funny, I also had absolutely horrible arm pain the first time but all of my other symptoms were so much worse that I never even think to mention the arm pain. 

This time I did 15 windmills in each direction about once an hour the day of my shot and the next. I definitely still have soreness, but nothing like last time.",mwbz2i,2021-04-23 00:16:33
I’m glad! Yeah it was a little giddy sensation for sure. I also had it when I actually HAD covid. My partner and I would sit and bed and laugh over the dumbest things until we couldn’t breath (literally) I wonder if it’s just the virus with its mood swings (I mean I get emotional when I get a fever anyways!) or just the sheer weirdness of the pandemic hahahaha,mwbz2i,2021-04-23 19:42:15
Did you go?!,mwbz2i,2021-04-28 00:05:43
"I’m currently over 24hrs into my 2nd shot and actually feel pretty good. The usual arm pain, light headache, and slightly tired; but nothing like the first dose. Hopefully I don’t jinx myself here because I didn’t take tomorrow off. 

What I did differently: I didn’t go for a run or workout after getting the vaccine. I didn’t work an 8hr shift the following day. Drank a fuck ton of electrolytes/water, took ibuprofen every 6 hrs on the dot, and just chilled out doing nothing.",mwbz2i,2021-05-19 22:58:32
"Yes! At 14 days out from second. Chronic fatigue. Sucks! (58, F)",mweui2,2021-04-23 01:57:04
I’m looking forward to being tired when I get my shot Saturday. I need the rest.,mweui2,2021-04-23 05:27:13
"Yea I (47M) felt that way for about 10 day’s after the 2nd shot, after the 3 days of flu. Then one day I felt fine. 10 days of feeling that way takes a bit to recover from in itself tho. So even tho I felt better it took a few more days to catch back up to normal.",mweui2,2021-04-23 05:32:16
My mom (70f) was exhausted for about 14 days. She snapped out of it then got her second dose and was tired another 14 days hahaha- but she was thrilled to be vaccinated nonetheless 💥,mweui2,2021-04-23 05:10:47
Yes!! I had the 2nd dose 5 days ago and I’ve never been so sleepy in my life. I am NOT at all the type of person that takes a nap and for the past 5 days that’s all I want to do!,mweui2,2021-05-23 19:41:51

"The evening of my second Moderna vaccine (4 weeks ago) I had a sore arm and chills. Next day, I was light-headed and very tired. Took me 3 attempts and 12 hours of sleep to even get out of bed. Slept most of the day.  Two nights later, had diffuse hives- flanks, thighs, neck, head, ears, few on back and chest. Took 2 benadryl and went back to bed, Two nights later, same thing. This continued for 2 weeks. Skipped a week and then back for 2 more episodes. All told, 9 episodes of hives. I haven't had another episode in 4 days so think the reaction might be over. If it does continue, I may go into my primary physician for testing. Benadryl took care of the hives.  I feel that my body was reacting to the vaccine and that it is self-limiting.",mwivau,2021-04-25 02:40:49
I just saw your post on here. It’s been 8 weeks and you still have them? I was hoping it was brief and just stopped after a few days...,mwivau,2021-04-23 07:04:24
"Thanks! I’m thankful to have Benadryl on hand as my fiancé gets them time to time. Just not sure how long I should wait before I should get them checked out. They’re not terrible, just annoying when I think about them.",mwivau,2021-04-23 07:09:44
Me too. I have seen 9 doctors and been on prednisone 3x. Two more doctors today. Will let you know if i get answers.,mwivau,2021-04-23 13:03:40
"I put up with 5 days worth of swelling, hives and itchiness; then did telemedicine visit with dermatologist. He prescribed an RX Medrol pack and non-drowsy antihistimines (Claritin) and things cleared up slowly within 3 more days or so. It was VERY uncomfortable and terrible itchy, but nothing alarming. Not compared to getting COVID.",mwivau,2021-04-23 07:16:28
Thank you! Sincerely hope you get well soon... Best of luck!,mwivau,2021-04-24 00:10:39

"Received first Moderna dose April 2nd, about five days after severe back pain for 2.5 weeks in addition to regular headaches and intermittent dizziness. Sucks. Scared to get second dose.

Headache and tinnitus since shot in February.,mwduet,2021-05-02 19:27:57

"It wasn’t, but very possible the cumulative effect of bad posture and sitting at a non ergonomic desk for a year set me off. I went to the chiropractor and they said my spine was misaligned. They were actually pretty surprised at the bad shape I was in (30m). Possible the vaccine brought my back tightness and pain to the attention of my body and my body just... kept it around to tell me something was severely wrong?",mwduet,2021-05-04 19:47:55

"I had just started my period prior to the first dose and then it stopped. Could be stress (side effects are still getting to me 48 hours later and I'm anxious they'll get worse), could have been the vaccine, who knows. I just thought it was super weird that an hour before my shot it was business as usual and then after the shot it stopped.",mwj7ll,2021-04-23 03:02:18

"29f. Yes! I've started on a Thursday for the last several years. I got my first shot on March 22, then started that Wednesday. Then this week I started on a Monday. Both have been 3 days with light spotting on the 4th. That's still normal thankfully.",mwj7ll,2021-04-23 13:12:29
"the (potential) mental and (definite) physical stress on your body (from dealing with the antigens introduced) probably caused the cycle to be thrown off.

"Yeah, it can ruin placenta development too. 2023 is when the trials for these vax end. Anyone getting it is literally part of a trial. We will soon see the effects. There's a reason the Pfizer CEO won't be giving it to his family or himself... Look into the exact spike protein strand they use, and previous results in other mRNA tests... You can read back as far as 2014 they've been messing around with this specific spiked protein. They have results online too... Not fun results, but they are there if you look. I guess we wait for 2023 and get official results from Pfizer/Moderna. Good news is we will have a LARGE sample size to reference. Judging by these sub reddit posts it looks like we will have a LOT of side effects to cover.",mwj7ll,2021-04-23 17:04:54

And congrats on joining the Double Shot Club.",mwbw8x,2021-04-22 20:40:16
"Yes.

I was so anxious for like 2 weeks after my first shot that I asked my doctor to refer me to a psychologist over it. 

My second shot was 3 days ago and I had a panic attack and hyperventilated about 4 hours after, another the next day, and have also cried 6 times since I got the shot. I feel like crying right now, but I got shit to do. This is not normal for me.

My coworkers were all vaccinated around the same time as me, and a bunch of them told me they were anxious, iritable and weepy.

Anxiety, crying, and irritability are well known side effects of flu vaccines and some other vaccines. My guess is that it happens to a lot of people with the Moderna Covid vaccine, but is underreported.

I hope you're feeling better soon.",mwf6x3,2021-04-23 00:47:29

"Yep. I got really bad nausea with my 1st shot (I had Covid last year). Nausea for days and coming in waves. Like morning sickness. So I thought to myself, ""If this is like morning sickness, treat it like morning sickness."" My grandma always said the cure is to ""eat a little a lot."" Avoid large meals. Eat two or three tablespoons of easy to digest food. Toast, banana, applesauce, a little pastina or soup. Just enough so you don't get hungry and low blood sugar. My nausea was helped tremendously by this old trick and was gone completely after a week. 

Good luck and congratulations on getting fully vaxxed. You're almost through it. Cheers!",mwaxye,2021-04-22 21:04:23

"To be honest, I’m going to wait for the call back cause I am on a lot of medications (none of which that affect my blood to my knowledge) and I am currently in not the best states of health. Which was why when I called I was bit upset with the answer of “we will get back to you”. I’m only a little worried that if it comes back to anything it’s not serious and hoping coincidence. If they call back and let me know what’s up I’ll update.",mwa4un,2021-04-22 19:21:07
I would definitely have someone on call just incase.,mwdlg9,2021-04-23 00:30:38
I have definitely had flu like symptoms today (second dose yesterday afternoon) but everyone is different....,mwdlg9,2021-04-22 21:14:36
Where did you get tested?,mw9tn4,2021-04-23 01:33:33
"In my area Kroger has a little clinic inside the store, took 15 mins, $25.00.

"You will be fine, don't stress. It's much better than the alternative:)",mw4koz,2021-04-22 14:46:40
"I think it's common for people to worry about the vaccine because it's brand new. My mom was somewhat worried, but I wasn't, because I'd been following the vaccine development closely since March 2020 and had pulled up a lot of safety data, all of which is reassuring.

The vaccine has been tested in a 30,000 person study, and given out to tens of million people, all without any worrying safety signals, except a roughly [1 in 400k](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/01/22/moderna-covid-vaccine-anaphylaxis-012221) risk of anaphylaxis, which is treatable. So the chance of the shot endangering your life or health is infinitesimal.

If you're worried about feeling sick afterwards, it's definitely a possibility but not super likely. The CDC has a [table of side effect probabilities](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html) which I believe is from the phase 3 trial. 57% of patients reported any systemic side effect (including mild ones), but so did 44% of the placebo group.

I got my first dose last week, and my only side effects were a sore arm and very slight joint aches. I wasn't tired, feverish, or anything.",mw4koz,2021-04-23 06:20:31
"Keep in mind that EXTREMELY bad side effects are pretty rare. You hear more about them because it's human nature for people to discuss bad experiences more often.

I had my second dose on Monday. I definitely did have some side effects - joint pain, body aches, mild fever. I would compare it to a mild flu. It was absolutely manageable! Just have the day after off to lay in bed and nap.

I was TERRIFIED of absolutely AWFUL side effects. No, I certainly didn't feel good and I definitely needed to rest, but it was far better than I anticipated. And it's DEFINITELY better than getting COVID. 

You are going to be absolutely fine. :)",mw4koz,2021-04-22 16:12:39
"When I went in for my second dose, the needle-tech (a retired nurse, total old school) said that most of the people she was seeing had lots of anxiety. it's okay to tell the person giving you your shot that you're nervous. They understand.

You're not alone. Be brave. Keep a positive heart and mindset. We are all in this together. We'll be through it soon. 200+ million doses so far. You're going to be a-ok. I promise.

EDIT: I just saw that you posted 6 hours ago. Are you all done? Come back and tell us about your experience and how you feel now. Cheers!",mw4koz,2021-04-22 20:58:52
You are gonna do fine! Just be ready for a sore arm. I say you should do some arm stretch’s prior and drink some Gatorade before too. You got this. Keep us posted!,mw4koz,2021-04-22 14:54:21
It’s ok to have some anxiety. The vaccine side effects are noticeable but nothing serious. Even if you feel some discomfort it should only last 2-3 days at most! Stay hydrated — cheers,mw4koz,2021-04-22 15:34:34
If you take Tylenol or like eight hours after I think you’ll be OK I was pretty achy with a second shot last night I had it at 4pm and I had fatigue and a hard time sleeping just achy but didn’t take any Tylenol.   I kept thinking this sucks but so lucky cause it is nothing compared to actual Covid.  you’ll be fine I’m the biggest baby/ hypochondriac and I’m whining but I’ll be ok.,mw4koz,2021-04-22 18:51:58
"I've read more about fevers and such after the second dose, or first dose if you were previously infected with covid. I got my first moderna shot 24 hours ago. I was basically fine yesterday, maybe a little fatigue and achy at the end of the day.

Today has been pretty much more of the same, tired, mild aches, arm is a little sore today when it wasn't really sore yesterday, that's it so far. Edit: I've also had a very mild headache that started a few hours ago, but I don't know if the vaccine is to blame for that.",mw4koz,2021-04-22 19:02:40
"You will be okay! After both my doses I had very minimal side effects. After my first, nothing but a sore arm. After my second, I had sore arm/armpit and very minor muscle aches. I was able to go on with my day. I feel like many people that don’t have bad side effects don’t report anything. So just keep that in mind! :)",mw4koz,2021-04-22 22:02:10
"You will be fine, even with some of these side effects",mw4koz,2021-04-22 15:28:13
You’ll be fine. Most people have mild symptoms from the 1st dose.,mw4koz,2021-04-22 19:00:12

"I'm going to wait to take such things aside from my normal allergy medicine, because I don't want to have symptoms camouflaged that they might want to see.",mw4koz,2021-04-22 22:34:05
Thank you for the possibility of headaches. I'll keep my migraine medicine on standby. I'm prone to them.,mw4koz,2021-04-22 22:33:05
"Thats what most of my shots have been like. Though when I got my flu shot a few years ago, I had a very nasty flu like experience that lasted a week. It destroyed my health physically for awhile. I don't get the flu as bad now though.",mw4koz,2021-04-22 22:32:11

It takes around 2 weeks for the covid vaccine to reach some level of efficacy.,mvlmda,2021-04-22 01:26:59
what test?,mvlmda,2021-04-22 01:08:45
"Interesting! It could also be that we have different immune responses (assuming your test was also for anti-spike antibodies and not anti-nucleocapsid antibodies). I watched the video someone linked above and there does appear to be a period of overlap with IgM and IgG antibodies (edit: and I tested slightly later than you when IgM had dropped off for me), which might explain it. 

I don't know if it matters but I did not have a strong reaction to the 2nd dose of vaccine, and I don't generally have big reactions to vaccines. I felt very fatigued and had muscle soreness for a day or so, but that was about it.",mvlmda,2021-04-23 01:27:56
UGH. Why are these so expensive? We should have cheap rapid tests available by now.,mvlmda,2021-04-22 03:44:56
Thank you for this. Just ordered. Great to have on hand,mvlmda,2021-04-22 15:35:10
This is where I went! I would caution against doing it too early though - had family do it at the 2 week mark post 1st dose (of Pfizer) and it was negative. Learned from that and waited a good chunk of time post Moderna.,mvlmda,2021-04-22 04:29:20
TY! That helped a lot.,mvlmda,2021-04-22 01:01:46
"IgM are the antibodies that the body produces when fighting an on going covid infection. IgG are the antibodies that the body produces post infection, the ones that give you an undetermined time of immunity after being sick.

I hope my second shot is smooth! I can’t wait to put this vaccine behind me because it’s as anxiety wracking as Covid fear. Glad you are fine!,mvz3yn,2021-04-22 13:03:17
Omg lucky! I’m also a 20f and I had pretty bad fatigue/ arm soreness and my second day got a fever and chills for about 8 hours. I also was having an asthma flare up because of it so I’m glad you got out of it relatively pain free!!!! I was also on my period at the time so I don’t know if that affected anything but congrats on being vaccinated! Welcome to the baddies club 😂👏🏼,mvz3yn,2021-04-22 15:18:37

"My shoulder felt like it got ran over by a truck. The next night I got chills and a slight fever but I also drank which may have contributed. Then about 4 days later I got the nastiest canker sores ever. Not sure it was cause of the vaccine but I've never got ones as painful or as many at a time, also read that some other people got them too so figured that must be why.",mvwqou,2021-04-22 05:36:22

Yeah that is how I felt too. Never mess with ufc fighters.,mvwqou,2021-04-23 02:32:45

"That’s an oversimplification.
I have canker sores a lot, about 50% of the time.

This has gotten me thinking about the immune system, mine is certainly not weak, maybe overactive?",mvwqou,2021-04-22 11:29:09
"This sounds like ""Covid arm"" -- you can ice it or the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html) suggests taking an antihistamine if it's itchy, but common as a minor side effect for the local injection site and it should go away on its own. I'd take a look and see if your symptoms line up, and hopefully that will make you feel better!

Edit: added suggestion on antihistamine if itchy and CDC link",mvzund,2021-04-22 13:28:04
Same here hopefully it goes away soon,mvzund,2021-04-22 20:03:17

31yoM. I just received my moderna vaccination at 1230pm today and my anxiety was through the roof. I also suffer from health anxiety and I was in full panic mode. I spoke to the nurses and they talked me through the whole process and talked to me afterwards throughout the waiting period. As of right now the only side effect I'm feeling is a sore arm. I did not feel the needle it was so quick. Hopefully it is the same for you!,mw05wa,2021-04-22 09:41:47
Yes I’m the same you’ll be ok. Just remember you’ve survived so far. I I’m such a worrier I just said suck it up to myself what option do I have we are lucky.  My symptoms aren’t unbearable and expected with the second dose. It’s not the vaccine it’s your immune system that is fighting for you.  Bring a little brown bag if you’re worried that you can breathe in and stay calm this is a good thing .  You survived a pandemic.  I only had sore arm with the first. I just had my second dose  at 4 yesterday but I did not take any Tylenol when I felt achy about 8 hrs after.,mw05wa,2021-04-22 19:08:39

When I had mine done I asked questions and the pharmacist explained what to expect and possible side effects. I admit I’ve been having a rough week. My anxiety is through the roof. My longest side effect is muscle tightness/spasms. It comes and goes. It’s not painful just annoying. Hopefully you only have the sore arm! Good luck.

About 4 hours after I got the shot, I felt really high for about 7 hours straight. & I did see a lot more things, but I'm also under a lot of stress, so I sort of chalked it up to that, but hell, it could have been both tbh. It definitely did my brain in though & I hadn't heard anyone else have this experience otherwise, esp for a first dose. I'm kinda freaked out about the second one now bc of this tbh. My first dose side effects were pretty intense for like 48 hours & nobody else ever even seemed bothered so I hadn't expected it at all.",mvqp04,2021-04-22 02:53:29
"Wow, thanks for sharing your experience. Reading these comments makes me wonder if maybe my vaccination isn’t what made my depression worse and despite having gone up in my medication dosage.

That's very interesting. I had a hard time with anxiety and feeling depressed after my first shot. I wonder if it somehow lessened the effectiveness of my SSRI.,mvqp04,2021-04-22 01:23:42

I hope your family member is okay, the big hallmarks of the disease are delusions, hallucinations, disorganized or nonsensical speech and catatonic, but you don’t need all of the factors to have it. Tele psychiatry is really useful in the age of COVID",mvqp04,2021-04-22 00:14:46
No my only physical issue was limited range of motion in the arm I received the vaccine,mvqp04,2021-04-22 13:38:47
I hope the increase works for you and maybe its a good idea to book an appointment with your doc for a few days after your next shot?,mvqp04,2021-04-22 02:51:39
"Yes and gut flora, I have seen these studies. The thing is, I could also drink four glasses of wine fairly easily about a week after my first shot. Usually the antidepressant I take makes alcohol very potent and I can only handle one glass. That's what made me link the two. Regardless, it's a good idea for people who have a mental health condition to keep in mind that they may need extra support after the vaccine.",mvqp04,2021-04-22 02:45:21
I'm very glad that you're being proactive about it and are taking care of yourself! That takes a strong person.,mvqp04,2021-04-22 01:24:51
"Got my first moderna shot yesterday and today I feel the same fatigue, chills, nausea and achy.",mvtuep,2021-04-22 02:05:06
"Thanks for the somewhat positive update! I’m supposed to be getting my 2nd in two hours and I’ve been having a panic attack all day reading. Mostly my health anxiety makes me afraid of vomiting and nausea. I had Covid in November, no vomiting. First shot, no vomiting. I’m just psyching myself out so bad.",mvtuep,2021-04-26 18:40:40
"These bumps are all over my scalp too. Sleep
Disruptive. Doctor says eczema but I never had that so I have no idea if it normally looks like this. Soooooo itchy. 3 rounds of prednisone only worked temporarily.",mvs00e,2021-04-22 00:14:37
"Not a doctor, but I have chronic hives and hay fever. Try adding a Zantac to your Zyrtec. It really does help.",mvs00e,2021-04-22 04:25:53
I was going to say it looks like eczema. Try cortisone 10!,mvs00e,2021-04-25 05:15:53
Thank you. Ill try it. How many times a day do you take those?,mvs00e,2021-04-22 12:34:41
Thanks. I did. Im on tons of antihistamines and use tht cream too. Ugh.,mvs00e,2021-04-25 13:23:50
I came on this thread for the same reason!!! I'm hoping to goes away soon! I got my 2nd dose on Friday 4/17. Woke up on Monday and had panic attacks throughout the whole day. It seems like it's getting better day by day. Hope you get through this!,mvt1rj,2021-04-22 01:44:59
"Yeah, anecdotally, this is happening to a lot of people. 

Anxiety and weepyness are side effects of some other vaccines, including flu vaccine, so I think ita very possible that they are related but there hasn't been much research to confirm it yet, so its not being reported as a side effect.",mvt1rj,2021-04-23 00:54:34
I have anxiety and it’s been worse since the shot. I don’t know if I can blame the vaccine or just my brain lol 🤷‍♀️can definitely relate. I’ve been having leg tremors and muscle tightness since the shot too and it’s making my anxiety worse,mvt1rj,2021-04-22 01:22:41
"Ive had a bit of the opposite effect, I feel like shit and my anxiety has dropped. Lathargic now.",mvt1rj,2021-04-22 02:31:17
"Anxiety/panic attacks after first and second dose!! Throat/chest tightness, palpitations.. it comes and goes. Usually worst first thing in the morning or after eating.",mvt1rj,2021-04-22 02:42:14
"Are you on medication? I just found out that the vaccine can potentially mess with your medication absorption, causing you to see a spike in symptoms of anxiety or depression. I have anxiety and depression and I take a medication for the anxiety. I didn’t have an increase in anxiety but I did have an increase in depression and I did have increased heart rate for a bit after both doses.",mvt1rj,2021-04-22 05:04:42
"I went on medication to treat the anxiety I felt after the vaccine. Doctor think it’s unrelated. I was already an anxious person and managed without medication, but nightly panic attacks and daylong anxiety attacks pushed me to get medicated. One week after the vaccine the anxiety calmed down but I don’t feel the same. :/",mvt1rj,2021-04-22 13:15:48
Yep. Anxiety scaled up about 300%. I've been weepy and had a panic attack every day for the last 3 days.  I'm 10 days after my first dose. My anxiety hasn't been this bad in years.,mvt1rj,2021-04-23 15:28:24
"Came on here searching for this exact thing. I'm a 35yr old female and I had my second shot Friday 4/30 and now feel anxiety-like weight on my chest and throat that comes and goes. Lasts for maybe 20-30 minutes, then goes away. Hopefully it week go away soon. I have struggled with anxiety in the past, but no longer, and would really like it too stay away!",mvt1rj,2021-05-03 01:50:14
"Not canker sores, but thrush. I wonder if vaxx makes us more vulnerable? I’m on symbicort inhaler for asthma and have to carefully rinse mouth and throat with water after using to avoid thrush. I haven’t had it in years but it showed up after shot 1.",mvxfkq,2021-04-22 08:20:35
I got a canker sore AND a cold sore. I know it was the vaccine because I never get cold sores in April.,mvxfkq,2021-04-22 23:38:22
I did,mvxfkq,2021-04-22 18:27:29
I got weird bleeding lesions on my soft palate -- one week after first dose.,mvxfkq,2021-04-23 03:09:14
My husband got a huge one under his tongue after the 2nd shot. Came out of nowhere.,mvxfkq,2021-04-23 15:23:09

"Thx for sharing. Getting second dose today and I'm nervous, but it ain't stopping me. Out of curiosity, did you try and stay extra hydrated before/after? I know it's anecdotal, but I'm loaded up on sprite/gatorade/pedialyte just in case, and am gonna try to refill my nalgene a few times as well. Get well soon OP!",mvefz4,2021-04-21 15:17:01
I also got my second dose yesterday. Felt fine until I went to bed. Had to take 3 ibuprofen this morning.,mvefz4,2021-04-21 18:50:16
"I got pretty tired and achy from the first one ans my lymph nodes swelled up. I got my second yesterday too and so far its not as bad physically, but I haven't stopped wanting to cry since about 4 hours after the shot. I just got sent home from work for being too weepy.",mvefz4,2021-04-21 15:47:48
Same I have the fever and chills and aches.  Mistake #1 of the week was not skipping leg day on Monday.  This was a level up week and I abused my leg muscles.   The fatigue paired with the shot reaction is rough!,mvefz4,2021-04-21 18:43:14
"Did you have any side effects from your first dose? Literally just walked in the door from getting our second doses. No issues with first, besides sore arm for a few days. Pharmacist said if we had no issues with first, the second should be the same. Cleared our calendars for the rest of the week just in case.",mvefz4,2021-04-21 21:08:15
1:45pm. Fever is gone. Back at 98.6. Just a lil tired. Seems to be a 24 hr thing. Be well everyone! You got this,mvefz4,2021-04-21 18:45:11
I got mine yesterday too. I got a small fever of 100. something and felt like I was spontaneously combusting. Took two Tylenol and a nap. Feeling pretty close to normal now 27 hours in,mvefz4,2021-04-21 20:09:40
Update. 10:22am. Feel fine now...just a little groggy. I got a long hot shower. Moved around a bit and took two tylenol. I drank lots of water yesterday (i always try and drink about 4-5 nalgenes a day). Temp is at 99.5,mvefz4,2021-04-21 15:23:59
Twins haha,mvefz4,2021-04-21 19:24:08
Snag some tylenol. It helps!,mvefz4,2021-04-21 15:55:22
I got weepy with my second dose yesterday too! It hit me really hard.,mvefz4,2021-04-21 17:30:29
I had no issues with #1,mvefz4,2021-04-21 21:11:51

5pm. Fever went up from 97 to 101. Really feeling bad right now,mvefz4,2021-04-21 21:50:09
"It fucks up my guts, but ill try ibuprofen.",mvefz4,2021-04-21 16:05:01
Hopefully you took some Tylenol and went to sleep. I hope you feel better soon!,mvefz4,2021-04-22 00:42:44
I get mine tomorrow! Told my boss already that I may need to take sick leave Friday and he was kind of a dick about it.,mvh3f2,2021-04-21 19:10:57
Thanks for sharing. I had a very similar experience!,mvh3f2,2021-04-21 17:32:58
"Living this right now.  I (38m) had my second moderna administered around 12:30 PM 4.20.  Felt fine this morning waking up but took PTO just in case.  Made a run to home depot thinking, this is nothing.  Halfway through my run I started feeling hot.... then cold... uh-oh.  Told my wife I was ready to head home.  Checked my temp and am hovering around 100.9.  Took a 3 hour nap and feel absolutely wiped out.

So glad I took the PTO day.  I'm the sort to go, go, go even when I'm a little sick and this has me down and out.  My wife got her shot at the same time and aside from aching she is fine.

If Moderna and take a few letters out of it and rearrange you and up with Man Flu.  Hopefully I'm feeling up to sitting at my son's baseball game this evening.  Hydrate and rest is the name of the game.",mvh3f2,2021-04-21 18:41:05
Second jab tomorrow. Planning for a couple days of vegging in front of the TV,mvh3f2,2021-04-21 22:27:05

"I would contact a doctor, but I’m a hypochondriac of sorts. Always best to error on the side of caution. Imo",mvntzi,2021-04-21 21:04:06
"Yes, I’ve heard this happens! It didn’t for me because I was already in my period during the first shot.",mvntzi,2021-04-21 23:20:41
Moderna disrupted my cycle after each shot- period came approx 10 and 7 days early after first and second. I know another woman who had early period following vaccine  also... This bothers me.,mvntzi,2021-04-22 09:14:24
"Hi.. did your nosebleeds stop?
My brother has the same problem. He started having nosebleeds after second dose of moderna. He also had a clot coming out of his nose. He is going to his doctor today, just wanted to know if it resolved for you?",mvntzi,2021-05-05 17:05:41
"I actually did end up messaging my doctor after writing this post out cuz if someone else had wrote this, I'd tell them to contact their doctor.",mvntzi,2021-04-21 21:05:45
My 21 yo daughter had her 1st shot 4/16. Two days ago her period started two weeks early. I’ve seen a few other people mention it on here. She has a message in for her doc. There must be some correlation.,mvntzi,2021-04-22 18:01:52
My nosebleeds stopped on their own and my doctor ran some blood tests to see if there were any issues but it seems like that came out pretty normal. She didn't seem to think it was cuz of the vaccine but I'm hearing a lot of stories where this has happened. I hope your brother is okay and his doctor can help.,mvntzi,2021-05-05 17:36:14
What did your doctor say? That’s scary 😦,mvntzi,2021-04-21 22:20:48
Is she on birth control by any chance? I have felt as if I should be getting my period after my second shot but I am on bc and am not due for at least another 5-6 days,mvntzi,2021-04-23 01:00:13
I actually just got a call from the office this morning. The nurse said I should head to urgent care if I have another nosebleed and set up a phone appt with my doctor for tomorrow to see if I need to do any blood tests,mvntzi,2021-04-22 17:54:50

"Doctor said she isn't sure what it is. Said dose 2 I could either react the same, nothing, or hives/anaphylaxis. Anyone else experience this rash?",mvqqzg,2021-04-21 23:10:32
"I suddenly broke out in a rash on my arms and hands only, 2 days after my first dose.  Doctor told me it was allergies,  I've never had allergies in my 43 years here on earth! Lol,  kinda worried it's from the vaccine as well.",mvqqzg,2021-04-22 02:21:51
So strange. Does yours look like mine or more like hives?,mvqqzg,2021-04-22 03:48:19
More like yours.,mvqqzg,2021-04-22 04:32:50
Did you try taking benadryl? That stopped mine from spreading.,mvqqzg,2021-04-22 05:42:57
"I'm allergic to benadryl, using Zyrtec and has been working great",mvqqzg,2021-04-22 14:58:24
Ohh good luck I hope you have a comfy bed and Tylenol handy. Got my second dose yesterday and I had the worst night of my life.,mvrzi4,2021-04-22 01:48:35
Infuriating. I have a friend who is a pet/house sitter and she’s already lost several clients because they refuse to vaccinate and she is in recovery from cancer.,mvht5i,2021-04-21 16:36:32
"Update: starting around 20 hours after the shot, feeling a little off. Temp around 99.6 - 100.2 at highest. Felt a lot worse at that temp over the years.

Very manageable but something.",mvht5i,2021-04-22 00:24:00
"I tend to think well of my friends, and this person I thought was cool and considerate. She's not anti-Vax; she will get one when eligible. I just think some people get morally stupid when it comes to thinking about all this.

I mean, yeah, I didn't want to take that risk with her. I thought she'd had first round of vaccine and was visiting bc of that. I was willing to take that level of risk.

So now I have another thing to worry about for a few days. Not cool.",mvht5i,2021-04-21 16:41:26
"For me it was about 15 hours after I got the shot.  53/F
Vaccine Friday at 2pm. 
Went to bed at midnight, woke up at 3am and felt “off”. Not sick but not normal. 
Woke up at 5am and was miserable.  Stayed in bed all day Saturday. 
First temp was Sat at 5am 99.5. Last temp that evening was 101.4 at 1030pm. Hovered mostly between 100-101 all day. 
Woke up Sunday at 9am and felt perfectly fine. 
It was weird how good I felt compared to 24 hrs earlier.",mvht5i,2021-04-22 03:13:07
I’m in LA and work in the entertainment industry  — aka full of bullshit industry.  I’m going to need to see proof. Vaccine card or no go. lol,mvht5i,2021-04-21 17:21:25
"Lol, it's funny, NYC bros go to LA and their game doesn't work. Totally different vibe there. In NYC, you can't really bullshit -- people figure out what state you're in really fast and faking it just doesn't fly.

But in LA, you've got to have that lying/BS thing going for you or you're done.",mvht5i,2021-04-21 17:51:51
"Got my second dose yesterday and I felt horrible all night. Fever, headache, chills nausea. Random sharp joint pains. Was stuck in a weird bad thoughts/fever dream all night.  I seriously underestimated the side effects. I still have a massive headache and am super tired and laid in bed all day. Made me second guess myself for getting the vax, but it's worth it. Hope you're recovering well!!",mvns5r,2021-04-22 01:47:12
"My first shot was no big deal. I had no side effects except a sore arm. I recieved my second vaccine on 4/17. It was AWFUL. I was expecting the chills, body aches, possible fever and headache. I was not expecting the excruciating lower back and kidney pain. Today was the first day I woke up without pain. My back did start to hurt midday but nothing compared to the last few days.",mvns5r,2021-04-22 00:41:28
"I just got severe back pain, it’s been 15 hours after my second dose. Had to take ibuprofen. I’m a healthy 26 year old too without any prior lower back pain.",mvns5r,2021-04-22 00:47:06
"My boyfriend got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and had kidney pain for about 10 days, along with a bunch of other moderate-severe side effects. We were puzzled by that one as well. He’s got a very strong immune system and has been miserable. I’m sick all the time, have really strong reactions to flu and TDap vaccines, but had almost no side effects from my first dose of Moderna. It’s fascinating. So much we don’t know about the immune system and Covid. Seeing the large-scale psychological response to vaccination issues is extremely interesting as well...",mvns5r,2021-04-22 01:26:22
"Yes! Got my second dose yesterday afternoon and I’ve had the worst aches in my lower back and hips, like my bones are throbbing",mvns5r,2021-04-22 04:58:30
Also 23 and reading this has me dreading the next dose. I know it's a good thing to get it but my anxiety is getting the best of me. It's also strange to me that for some reason everyone I know who's had bad symptoms got Moderna. Meanwhile my Pfizer friends have had absolutely nothing.,mvns5r,2021-04-22 05:43:44
Omg are you me? You just described my entire past 24 hours. I'm doing ok now and ordered takeout as a treat. Hope you're taking care of yourself as well :),mvns5r,2021-04-22 01:49:22
I'm sorry to hear it was so awful! I was also super shocked by the lower back/kidney pain and google is bringing back NOTHING about kidney pain. So weird. I'm glad you're feeling better today & I hope you're even better tomorrow :),mvns5r,2021-04-22 00:56:12
"That back pain is terrible! I took some sort of pain meds last night (not sure which, I was kind of delirious haha) and they definitely helped. I recently bought a shiatsu back/neck massager and it's been a LIFE SAVER today.",mvns5r,2021-04-22 01:03:39
"I read that people with stronger immue systems should expect more side effects, as their immune system is causing thr symptoms.",mvns5r,2021-04-22 02:33:17
So interesting to hear how different people react differently to the vaccines. I'm just surprised I've had some side effects that aren't really main ones or ones you hear about!,mvns5r,2021-04-22 01:42:02
Me too ugh. Like there is no position I can sit or lay in that's comfy. Some ibuprofen helped me though!!,mvns5r,2021-04-22 05:10:49
"I'm so sorry! I feel waaay better tonight if that helps! I've also heard about my moderna people getting worse side effects, but I've gotten the worst out of everyone I know personally, so I bet it's less likely. Make sure you take pain meds if you need, though, and take care of yourself. Good luck!",mvns5r,2021-04-22 05:52:14
It varies from each person with both doses. If you go to the pfizer thread there's tons of posts about 2nd shot side effects. I too am not looking forward to my 2nd shot in 2 weeks but I also know it's best I get it and ride out any side effects. I wish you the best of luck.,mvns5r,2021-04-22 08:58:54
Omg I ordered take out too!!! That's so funny.,mvns5r,2021-04-22 01:51:15
I am definitely feeling much better today! I hope you start feeling better soon as well! I googled it as well and finally came on here and found one other post of a few people saying they also had kidney/low back pain. So I was happy I wasn't alone!,mvns5r,2021-04-22 01:03:02
"Yeah, that’s exactly what I decided must be the case (unless he previously had an asymptomatic  infection), based on what I’d read about older people having less side effects due to their generally weaker immune system response!",mvns5r,2021-04-22 03:23:08
Tylenol has been making it bearable for me! I’ve also been propping a pillow between my legs when laying down and that helps a bit,mvns5r,2021-04-22 05:16:14
"No worries lol. I'm also hoping that since I had symptoms from the first dose the second won't be as bad, idk why but I read that somewhere even though it doesn't apply to everyone.",mvns5r,2021-04-22 07:05:37

I have never experienced migraines before.  Week and a half later I see my doctor and they treat me with anti-inflammatory and migraine preventative.  Next day I go to the ER for stroke and seizure like symptoms.  I’m in constant pain, sleep is my only relief.  I’m so foggy I loose my place during sentences, had to take time off work.  All of the dr’s I’ve seen will not say it’s possible that this could be from vaccine.  Seems to coincidental not to be.  Ct scan showed no clots, aneurysm, or stroke.

"This was similar to my 1st dose reaction. I had it rough for the first week and had lingering symptoms until day 10, where I began to feel normal again.  My second dose wasnt as bad. I got mine on 4/14 and feeling fine now. I'd say this sounds like a fairly normal reaction. Her body may just be having a stronger response. She can log her symptoms on the VAERS website too. I believe they will check up on her daily",mvcxfu,2021-04-21 14:17:06
"This is all within the range of ""normal."" Its just her immune system responding very vigorously. I was sick for a week and a half after my first dose with migrain, nausea, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle aches. I also slept 12+ hours a day for 16 days after getting the first shot. 

I had my second shot appointment yesterday and almost chickened out. I don't feel as bad physically (yet) but I haven't been able to eat and haven't stopped wanting to cry since yestersay.",mvcxfu,2021-04-21 15:52:26
"28F- Got my first moderna shot yesterday and today I feel fatigue, chills, nausea and achy. Feeling better this evening",mvcxfu,2021-04-22 02:09:01
22F! My first shot of moderna really just resulted in soreness. But I received my second dose yesterday and I have been extremely nauseous and dizzy,mvcxfu,2021-04-23 13:25:12
Fever up to 102 now.  My normal temp is about 96/97,mve922,2021-04-21 21:39:09

Keep hydrating & taking Tylenol.,mve922,2021-04-22 04:16:21
"I feel like I’m the poster child for “worst case scenario” with Moderna. I do have psoriasis, so it’s likely just an over-zealous immune system. 

First shot I was very fatigued for about 36 hours. Arm felt like a tetanus shot. A VERY swollen lymph node showed up the night of day two. Easy peasy. Mostly just annoying discomfort. 

Got second shot on 4/19 at 1:30pm. Went to lunch, hopped on a plane back home, long drive from airport, and hit the hay around 10:00pm. Woke up early yesterday with a slight headache, and a very sore arm and back on that side. Within about six hours of waking up, my temp shot up to wildly fluctuating between 102 and 103. Major spasms in my back and ribs (think ice pick). Nauseous whenever I would sit up, but laying down wasn’t a picnic either. Heavy dose of NyQuil, but wasn’t really able to sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time. From about 4:00pm to 10:00pm the symptoms were the worst adding majorly screaming joints. Added ice packs to my head and neck to try to cool me off. Fever started to break around midnight, came down to 101 (oh, blessed sleep!). Was 100 when I got up at 7:00 this morning. It’s currently 11:00am my time and I feel MUCH better. Arm and back are a little sore and I have a very slight headache, but nothing like yesterday. Still have zero appetite after almost 48 hours since last meal. 

All told, it was a really shitty 18 hours. I haven’t been that sick in over a decade. 

Husband got his second shot at the same time. He was achy and very tired all day yesterday, but not bad enough to not be able to take care of me.",mvk6b0,2021-04-21 19:26:53
"I got sore arm, low fever and body aches and tiredness",mvk6b0,2021-04-22 00:47:20
"1st shot nothing at all besides sore arm then 7 days after I got a major rash around the injection site that itched so bad 
2nd shot 4/19 at 3pm 
Day of Not much really 
Day after migraine as soon as I woke up fatigued and nauseous 
2 days after fatigued and nauseous still with migraine neck pain so intense 
3 days after I woke up at 11:30am my pupils were the size of saucers fell back to sleep til last minute at 2pm to go to work fatigued migraine all day felt hot as crap couldn’t stop eating itchy arm neck pain super bad major knot in neck end of work day My injection arm was falling asleep 
Apparently my boss also got moderna and was sick like me for 4 days after",mvk6b0,2021-04-23 12:43:53
"I'm a 27/F and got my first dose yesterday. Not too bad. The shot was no big deal. At first, I felt perfectly normal. A couple hours later, my arm hurt to move. I couldn't sleep on that side last night. Still pretty sore today. But no other side effects. 👍",mvjbht,2021-04-21 18:48:34
I don't think fasting is a good idea because it might have a negative impact on your immune system or make you feel run down before the shot. I'd say just eat healthy meals. I just stayed well hydrated and took Tylenol as needed after the shot. I had no vomiting or anything serious.,mvjbht,2021-04-21 21:02:15
"I received mine (37/m) on Monday, and had absolutely no problem with the shot. My wife said that hers felt like a bee sting. Both of our arms were sore within a few hours and remained that way for roughly 48 hrs. We were especially groggy and tired on Tuesday but we’re both fine now and ready for our 2nd dose on the 17th. Good luck!",mvjbht,2021-04-21 19:00:00
"It totally depends on you. I (33f) got my first around lunch yesterday. Arm hurt in observation. Moved it around and exercised it. (You gotta move the arm around to prevent pain.) Apparently, didn't move it enough, still hurt to move and use but I still did it. Got a slight headache on one side. Like, so slight with a but of a neck twinge on the same side as injection. Took a warm shower and arm was achey but the soreness nearly subsided. I took an ibu 325mg. 

Just woke up. Arm pain is up again, stiffish shoulder. I grow nervous for my next shot. 

Don't take any OTC for pain before the shot.",mvjbht,2021-04-21 20:23:39
"I 31F  got my first shot yesterday at 9am. Around 6pm I had chills and I was freezing cold (my house temperature was 78F). The chills and coldness stopped within 30min with no medication. An hour later I started to have a low grade fever and my body was hurting everywhere. I took ibuprofen and the fever and pain went away for a couple hours. Around midnight I had a fever again took ibuprofen again and it got better. I couldn’t sleep well because of my sore arm and because I was hot and then cold all night. Today I’m felling 80% better, just tired and very little body aches. My husband 34M had nothing except sore arm",mvjbht,2021-04-21 21:25:26
"I got my first shot yesterday at 1:15 PM. Barely even felt the needle going in. Slowly throughout the day, I felt soreness in and around the injection site. By night time, the area where I got the shot felt warm and tender.

Today, it feels like someone punched my arm as hard as they could. Otherwise, no other side effects.",mvjbht,2021-04-21 22:13:57
"hey! 33F here, and i got my first shot a couple weeks ago. ive read in a lot of articles that women experience more symptoms than men & that remained true for me at least (ive never had covid & the last time i was sick was nov 2019). after the first 10 hours of receiving shot #1, i got the chills & was very fatigued so i ate dinner, took tylenol & went to bed at 8pm. i slept through the night & woke up at 6am feeling 100% better. i also had a sore arm but i just kept moving it around - the arm pain only lasted for a couple days (just dont get it in your dominant arm). the arm pain is **not** worse than a tetanus booster shot - that one hurt wayyy worse, imo. i generally eat pretty healthy & drink a lot of water, so i did the same before & after the first shot (ate lots of veggies, hearty meals & drank a lot of water). i dont think it's a good idea to fast, & i havent read anywhere that suggests changing your diet & normal routines ahead of time is beneficial (you could always ask a doctor ab that, & high blood pressure). 

i expect to experience similar & maybe even stronger symptoms with the 2nd shot in a couple weeks. i plan on getting some pedialyte, doing some healthy meal preps the day before in case im feeling lazy, & making sure i have tylenol on hand. it's definitely good to prepare yourself & im glad you're getting yours!",mvjbht,2021-04-21 23:30:38
"I felt super lightheaded after my first shot & I think it was because I didn't eat beforehand. I don't think fasting will be a good idea. It sounds like you probably have health related anxiety (I have the same thing), so if you think something bad is going to happen, you're going to experience symptoms that you typically wouldn't. Definitely eat before. A little bit of nausea is better than feeling like you're going to faint.

Before my second dose, I drank like 50 oz of water, a liquid IV (which is just an electrolyte supplement), ate, & washed my hair because I knew I wouldn't be able to the following day from arm soreness lol

You will do fine, I promise! I have a heart condition & everything went fine with me.",mvjbht,2021-04-22 02:06:03
"28F- Got my first moderna shot yesterday and today I feel fatigue, chills, nausea and achy. Feeling better by this evening though after eating",mvjbht,2021-04-22 02:07:44
"I (21f) got my first a week ago. Within a few hours my arm was pretty sore and hurt to sleep on that night. I work a very physical job in a warehouse and it was a little difficult because I felt very sluggish and out of it all day, but it wasn’t anything unbearable. That also went away when I actually sat down to relax at the end of the day. We’re all slowly getting vaccinated at work so all the guys understood and were very helpful. The next day I felt perfectly fine except for the sore arm still. The hardest part was the fact that I’m a side sleeper and couldn’t sleep on my right side for 2-3 days.",mvjbht,2021-04-22 02:15:04
Got my first shot today. Felt a little jittery immediately after. Also started running a low grade fever. Tylenol helped with that. Only other side effects for me so far is an upset stomach and I’m slightly itchy on my arms and legs.,mvjbht,2021-04-22 04:34:48
I got the first shot a week ago and today i woke with a swollen lymph node on my armpit. Apparently it's normal. Just a heads up if you get the same side effect.,mvjbht,2021-04-21 23:23:48
"Thanks! I was stung by a wasp a few years ago. On my tummy when I bumped into it. Despite wearing a shirt, it still got me. That feeling was horrible. It's like a sharp burning needle got stabbed into me. The area where I got stung swelled up, too! Took a few hours before it went away. I sure hope a bee sting doesn't feel worse than a wasp sting.",mvjbht,2021-04-21 20:34:27
"Thanks, I'll go move it around then.",mvjbht,2021-04-21 20:35:08
"oh I think I’m having that right now. It’s about a week after my first dose too. Did it last long for you? At first, I thought I had a zit lol",mvjbht,2021-05-07 14:35:47
For me it lasted about 3 days. It was kinda painful.,mvjbht,2021-05-07 17:52:54
thanks for letting me know. glad you feel better now!,mvjbht,2021-05-07 17:54:58
"Same. Got mine yesterday and other than a sore arm, did great all day. An hour before bed I had a fever and then had the worst night of my life. Ugh. Hopefully it’s over today. Plus my back is so sore.",mvigqi,2021-04-21 17:18:57
"I’m a 47 yo female and had the exact same experience! My shot was 9am yesterday and it all started going downhill around 8pm. High fever and just an awful, awful night. I am so glad to be feeling better.... hope you are too!!!",mvigqi,2021-04-22 05:30:52
Hope you feel better!,mvigqi,2021-04-21 16:45:49
"So sorry you had the icky experience! At the worst of mine, I texted a friend and said, “If I had known it would be this bad, I would not have done this!” And I’m in the high risk category. My thoughts went to some really dark places during the really bad several hours. Hope you’re feeling better. I’m almost 48 hours out from my second jab and fever is completely gone (hit 103 for an hour or so) and I’m back to feeling like I did after the first shot (mild fatigue and a little sore on my left side), so hopefully you’re on the same track and in the clear!",mvigqi,2021-04-21 19:32:51
"28F- Got my first moderna shot yesterday and today I feel fatigue, chills, nausea and achy. I’m feeling better tonight though",mvigqi,2021-04-22 02:10:00
I'm glad I'm not alone! And yep my upper back/ neck is so sore too. I'm afraid to get out of bed and that the headache will restart. Ugh.  Hope you feel better soon.,mvigqi,2021-04-21 18:01:22
Thank you!,mvigqi,2021-04-21 16:51:31
That's what I was thinking too how if I would have known how bad it was would I have even got it?! And yes I kept falling half asleep having creepy weird thoughts/dreams.. Just strange. I just started feeling icky again because my ibuprofen wore off. Hot shower and some snacks then back to bed for me. Hopefully I can go to work tomorrow evening! Glad you're feeling better I hope I will too.,mvigqi,2021-04-21 23:19:47
My first one I felt fine just a sore arm. Glad you're feeling better though I hope you don't get these terrible side effects your 2nd dose!,mvigqi,2021-04-22 03:10:12
I’ve heard anywhere from 8 to 24 hrs for symptoms to start. Maybe your lucky and won’t have any side effects!,mvf0ac,2021-04-21 13:58:42
Lucky! I started feeling bad about 9 hours later.,mvf0ac,2021-04-21 16:53:35
"The next day. 24-36 hrs. I spiked a 100.9 fever at around 36 hrs. It broke about 6 hrs later. Felt great the next day, but got really fatigued that evening. Took some Advil. Went to bed early. No problems since. Cheers!",mvf0ac,2021-04-21 16:38:26
"Well 23 hours later & I’m starting to feel kinda crappy. My skin hurts to the touch, my joints really hurt & I feel anxious (which is probably just me from noticing the symptoms). I haven’t taken any pain killers so I just did some Motrin & acetaminophen. Will update if I notice anything else. Also notice a slight headache but this is very normal for me, I have a headache all the time.

Edit: after about an hour I started to feel fine again. I’m thinking pain relievers are going to be the way to go as far as managing this feeling.",mvf0ac,2021-04-21 20:35:52
Few hours,mvf0ac,2021-04-21 21:11:03

"Yes, get the second dose. There is speculation that those who have a more severe reaction to the first dose already have the antibodies. Same thing happened to me. Its a good thing, it means your body had a stronger defense already in place. Chances are the second dose wont be as bad either.",mvakg4,2021-04-21 11:18:06
How did it go? Currently recovering from my first dose which has also been much more intense than other people. I'm pretty sure I never got COVID either (regularly tested and took an Antibody test in the summer).,mvakg4,2021-04-24 15:28:55
Well that’s weird if I got covid before I would assume tht I would at least get cold symptoms. That would mean that I got Covid before without symptoms which unusual cuz I get sick very easily,mvakg4,2021-04-21 13:40:42
"But aight either way maybe I was exposed to weakened version from the very beggining or sum, thanks for the advice thanks you!",mvakg4,2021-04-21 13:41:11
"Wow it would hve been more reassuring to hear from you before I took the second dose. But I basically experienced the same symptoms once again. I had medium high fever, cold sweats, chills , slight headache. So basically I felt sick but it was definitely not as bad as the first time and I think I was able to recober within a few days. I bascially had the same reactions but this this time I didn’t have as much of a pressuring headache but I did feel really tired and lethargic for a while. I would suggest you wat a lot and ensure ur immense system and health is well maintained before. I also didn’t sleep cuz of my college studies and that may have made me tired but I would say the vaccine made more tired than I usually would be. Make sure to drink lots of water , cuz tht made a huge difference for me",mvakg4,2021-04-24 15:33:39
eat a lot before it* also I always tend to avoid taking Tylenol because I want the maximum effectiveness and efficacy result from this vaccine and I don’t want Tylenol to reduce that effect,mvakg4,2021-04-24 15:34:43
"I would still say my first dose was double the severity cuz I genuinely had a rapid heart beat and I felt like I couldn’t breath , which wasn’t the same for the second dose",mvakg4,2021-04-24 15:36:17
Oh ya sorry just random symptoms pop to my head but I was also very nauseous than the first dose and I was much more forgetful than before,mvakg4,2021-04-24 15:41:40
"Okay that makes me feel better, glad it went okay! I was like damn I'm gonna die if I take the second dose and it's way worse than this.",mvakg4,2021-04-24 16:01:55
"It’s more than just tenderness at the injection site. My first shot gave me soreness, limited range of motion and difficulty raising my arm from the shoulder, more so than a normal shot would cause.

For context, I’m a veteran that’s traveled overseas and have had many shots, including the one they give in the butt muscle (I don’t recommend that one). This was worse than all those, except maybe the butt one.

Was hard reaching for mixing bowls and ingredients on the tippy top shelf of kitchen cupboards. Lasted about three days for me then quickly subsided. I got that shot 4/14 (the day before tax day), today I was doing push-ups and cardio again.",mvbl2q,2021-04-21 10:27:01
"definitely limited range of motion in addition to tenderness, but not numb. i was more sore than when i get the flu shot! had my first shot this past saturday and now i can pretty much move my arm any way now, however there is still some soreness. 

the woman administering the shot recommended i don’t get it on the arm i sleep on—definitely a good call!",mvbl2q,2021-04-21 11:12:00
"Yes, both.",mvbl2q,2021-04-21 16:11:05
"Still early on my second shot, but with my first, after the soreness went away around day three, my arm felt very weak for a couple days. Where lifting it hurt before, it took a lot of energy to hold up. Felt completely normal about four days post shot.",mvbl2q,2021-04-21 19:47:35
Very sore arm with both shots. Feels like a tetanus booster. My left arm is useless.,mvbl2q,2021-04-22 04:35:16
"I’m adding my Moderna vaccine experience with some hesitation, I’m very pro vaccine and I don’t want my outlyer  reactions to scare anyone from getting vaccinated. Background: male 71, excellent health, non smoker, etc. 
first shot :  I awoke in the middle of the night 16 hours after 1st vaccine. I was incredibly dizzy, terrible Vertigo, I couldn’t even sit up without getting nauseous. I had a fever and couldn’t eat for 2 days. I finally started to feel better on day 3.
Second shot; Within 18 hours,Vertigo returned with a vengeance. I also developed stomach cramping and severe diarrhea, I couldn’t even hold water in me. My temperature hit 101 and being unable to eat or hold fluids, I lost 8 pounds in 3 days. I was very sick .On day 4 my fever subsided and I slowly began to hold in liquids and was able to eat a bit. I felt quite ill for another week but my digestive tract slowly returned to normal. It was 2 weeks before I slowly began to regain some weight. My Doctor verified that my adverse reaction was unusual but not unique, she said she’d seen others. 
I would like to say that I don’t regret getting vaccinated and would do it all again without hesitation, being fully vaccinated is an awesome feeling. I had signed up with the CDC when I had shot # 1 and they have continually tracked my progress since my second vaccine 3/21, they checked in with me yesterday 4/21.",mvgppm,2021-04-21 16:05:09
"I’m a F 31, had my second shot yesterday and feel fine arm isn’t even that sore. 

The one thing you should keep in mind is changes to menstruation. After the first vaccine I had strong cramps, which is abnormal for me. I’m due again next week so I’ll see then.",muuoi5,2021-04-20 21:01:53
This gives me hope 2nd won't be as brutal!   :),muuoi5,2021-04-21 00:35:32
Nothing is worse than Tetanus booster shot LOL covid shot was a breeze for me too.,muuoi5,2021-04-21 01:47:02
"Thank you for mentioning this. I did have my period during the time in between both shots and it wasn't any different than usual, so I'm curious to see if anything changes from here out.",muuoi5,2021-04-21 00:05:08
"So, you do need pants. 😆

Thanks for bringing up menstrual changes! I keep forgetting that is a possible effect.",muuoi5,2021-04-20 22:40:02
I know several women who had a delayed period from the first shot. so odd!,muuoi5,2021-04-21 04:16:18
"Thanks for mentioning this! I also had a very weird period after my vaccine. It wasn’t late but it was just very different, spotting and a change in color. I’m also on BC so I wasn’t sure if it was the hormones but it’s never happened before. I did a google search and saw a lot of women saying similar things. I hope they do more research on this!",muuoi5,2021-04-21 05:11:18
"Oh yeah, those have always felt way worse for me too, lol",muuoi5,2021-04-21 01:50:59

Same! Its a new symptom they are starting to write about! I dont know if it will affect all future cycles or if the second will affect it too...so many unknowns,muuoi5,2021-04-21 06:08:44
"That sounds like lymph node swelling. I had it bad, with a lot of pain and swelling for about a week and a half and then the next 10ish days the swelling and pain slowly reduced. 

I didn't see a doctor because I'm poor, but if its accessible for you, they can help with anti inflammatory drugs or give you some more guidance.


I was just starting to feel normal again last week and then had to go for my second dose yesterday.",mv6of1,2021-04-21 16:08:50
"I sort of had the same thing. I had a painful, swollen lymph node right under my jaw for a month after my first dose, and then, bam, it just disappeared suddenly one day. I know a month is a while for side effects to last, and I was pretty worried, but it did go away. I did take turmeric and oregano supplements, they seemed to help.",mv6of1,2021-04-21 20:05:43
"Not a doctor. I could be wrong, but some of this sounds like inflammation. If that seems right to you, you can try some Turmeric, it helps with inflammation. You can get it with BioPerine, a black pepper extract that helps you absorb nutrients; and you can get it with Ginger, which helps with nausea, weight loss, indigestion, osteoarthritis, etc. Both work well, try them and see which you prefer.

You can also try activated charcoal to minimize inflammation and detox. Ibuprofen (Motrin) also helps with inflammation (but can cause anxiety).

How are the lymph nodes? Swollen, sensitive? No need to answer, just wanted to draw attention there. Feel free to ask if you have questions.",mv6of1,2021-04-21 10:44:39
I think more likely than not you're correct about inflammation! The nerves in my lower armpit/below my chest are incredibly painful. As for turmeric do you suggest taking it the form of a capsule or to rub it onto the skin directly as a powder/spice?,mv6of1,2021-04-21 22:26:02
"Well I had food poisoning a week before my second dose and when I got my shot I’d only been recovered for 2 days. Idk if my immune system was 100% at this point. Then the morning of my vaccine I felt a bit of general malaise and just feeling “off” but got the shot anyway because I couldn’t get it later. 

For 48 hrs now I have had high fever (100-102.5), chills, body aches, sore arm, and my lymph nodes hurt. Had 102 fever this morning but Tylenol helps a lot. Praying it’ll be over soon but yeah if you can maybe wait a little until you’re better. No idea if my symptoms are this bad bc my immune system was weakened but I heard the worse your reaction is the stronger your immune system is.",mvekx8,2021-04-21 17:35:01
"Me! Your timeline is very similar to mine. I'm on day 7 and the fatigue is a little bit better, but I'm still exhausted and nauseous and my arms occasionally feel sore. 
I'm hoping against hope that the 2nd dose will be not that bad.",mv4zsw,2021-04-21 02:12:02

"Have you had COVID-19 before? I have not, but I had a lot of nausea and constipation after the first dose, as well as almost passed out immediately afterward. I had to be monitored for longer than the standard 15 minutes. I also felt dizzy and had a headache and a fever, as well as full-body chills at times. My health conditions: POTS Syndrome, IBS-C, reproductive health issues and suspected thyroid issues.",mv4zsw,2021-04-21 23:43:21

Update though- it’s Wednesday afternoon and I almost feel back to normal, minus the ongoing nagging headache.",mv4zsw,2021-04-21 23:53:36
"I went to the doctor today. I have anxiety so this lasting fatigue and nausea is freaking me out. They took some blood and I'll hopefully hear back within a few days. But they said I look like I'm in ""the peak of health""....so that's frustrating but also a little comforting? I guess? I feel like trash but at least I LOOK fine. /s",mv4zsw,2021-04-21 02:30:30
Glad you are at least better now!,mv4zsw,2021-04-22 21:24:33
"😂 well at least you look good. Reassuring? lol
I also deal with anxiety- but have really been trying to separate my symptoms. It’s weird- but I can distinguish anxiety nausea from this nausea it’s completely different. 
I hope everything is normal, maybe a blood test will give some piece of mind- it’s not a bad idea to get done actually.",mv4zsw,2021-04-21 02:33:29
"Me too! This feels like sick nausea. My anxiety nausea feels...more fluttery? This feels heavy and thick. 
And yes, I've found that knowing what my cbc levels are at helps me know where to focus my anxious energy. If everything is fine, I can stop worrying about it and start focusing on how I'm gonna wait out these symptoms instead.",mv4zsw,2021-04-21 02:46:29
Oh my gosh- exactly! Heavy and thick is the best way to describe this nausea. Ugh it’s the worst.,mv4zsw,2021-04-21 02:51:17
"Yes, 4 days out and still could barely climb the stairs in my house so so fatigued. I went to Walgreens to grab a gallon of milk (wasn't up to full grocery store)  and happened to see ""Electrolit"" in the grocery aisle. It says it has ions, magnesium, potassium, calcium, sodium glucose, sodium lactate in it for ""premium hydration"". 

Honestly I've been guzzling gatorade like crazy because I heard hydration helps with side effects so I wasn't very hopeful but thought what the hell.

Anyways. I drank the whole bottle had a  bunch of bowel movements and about 6 hours later I feel amazing. Actually have energy for the first time since Friday and feel like myself. No headache, chills or fatigue. I just dug the bottle out of the trash so I can tell my husband to grab some more just in case.hope this helps",muz1vh,2021-04-21 01:16:05

Been tired since the first shot. it gets better. Sleep and hydrate and electrolytes!,muz1vh,2021-04-21 04:36:02
I am 20 days out and it is finally starting to fade and not be so pronounced. One of my buddies who is also 40 years old he’s having the same thing. He’s male and I’m female.,muz1vh,2021-04-21 04:11:57

"Im 8 days out of first shot and still experiencing crazy fatigue, nausea, mouth sores, headache. It was bad for first two days, then seemed to get much better, and then came back and whacked me around day 6, and is still persisting. The nausea is so draining. But I know its just a case of sitting tight and riding it out. I am going to start on electrolytes and hydrating. have not been doing anything like that--hopefully it will help",muz1vh,2021-04-23 03:18:33

It’s totally possible to have zero allergic reaction to a thing and then the second time you have it then you react. This is very common with antibiotics like amoxicillin. The first time I had amoxicillin no problem. The second time I had it I broke out in hives and swelled up.,mv4a8d,2021-04-21 04:44:50
"
In the last FDA report that I've seen, there was only one documented case of anaphylaxis after a second dose of Moderna, and only four after a second dose of Pfizer (although in a few cases, the dose involved wasn't known):

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776557

Anaphylaxis after either vaccine is very rare, and anaphylaxis after the second dose almost never happens, at least based on data released so far by the FDA.",mv4a8d,2021-04-21 05:41:08
"I know you're anxious about your second shot. I was too. I'm 37/F with Crohn's Disease on immunosuppressive meds. 

My first shot was awful. 3 day migraine unresponsive to my interceptors, back pain, shooting nerve pain across my abdomen, swollen and sore lymphnodes, and then my Crohn's flared up because when my immune system gets on alert, that's what it does next. It was miserable. 3 weeks later I felt human - just in time for shot number 2 yesterday. 

Shot two has been a breeze! Just tired and a sore arm. My husband had fatigue with the second for a day and that was it. 

I was really worried too, but decided to put my trust in the science. Keep telling yourself that everyone is different. It'll be okay.",mv4a8d,2021-04-21 20:54:58
How did you get to this specific case on VAERS? Like how did you know the ID # to look up?,mv4a8d,2021-04-21 02:30:47
"Your immune system doesn't recognize it as something potentially dangerous for the first one, so you have a md reaction.
For the second, your immune system recognizes it and overreact.

Most allergies get worse with more exposures. Its just how the immune system works. 


I am not an immune system -ologist.",mv4a8d,2021-04-21 16:13:58
Thanks. Been wondering about this too.,mv4a8d,2021-05-14 20:53:28

I didn't. I was looking through moderna reactions in young people.,mv4a8d,2021-04-21 03:47:33
"I mean... I'm not a doctor... but she had prior severe allergies that required her to carry an epi pen. 

Allergic reactions can be dependent on amount of exposure. And just with other allergies they can pop up out of nowhere. People with severe food allergies talk all the time about how one month they're eating a strawberry just fine next month strawberries are no longer safe.",mv4a8d,2021-04-21 03:54:27
Thanks. I'm due for my second shot in a week and I'm having really bad anxiety about it. The waiting to see if I'll have a reaction freaks me out.,mv4a8d,2021-04-21 04:04:45
"Then definitely stop reading VAERS... nothing on VAERS means it was definitely the vaccine so all you're gonna do is freak yourself out.

Any updates?,mv58sf,2021-04-21 23:27:15
Still doing ok. Getting a little nauseous off and on but nothing serious. Slight headache. Super tired. Nothing terrible though.,mv58sf,2021-04-22 00:29:22
"46F. Pretty much same here. 2nd dose, 4/18. I spiked a 100 degree fever at the 36 hr mark. Sore arm, too. 

I took some Advil last night, fever broke. Woke up feeling great today. 

This has been my experience for years with other vaccines like the flu shot. 

My Dose 1 was total ass, so I’m glad things went better for Dose 2. 

Congratulations!",mupxkh,2021-04-20 17:20:21
💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 Love hearing these positive experiences.,mupxkh,2021-04-20 18:23:39
That is awesome you had a better experience than me! I am still trying to recover from it. Everyone’s bodies are different and react not all the same. I am 50 female athletic 120 lbs. and it made me very sick. I hope you all have just mild symptoms.,mupxkh,2021-04-20 21:19:55
" My first shot was a piece of cake. Hoping the 2nd is just as easy. People I have spoke to have not had 2nd shot issues. These are real people, in person.  Lol. Not someone who knew someone who knew someone, who saw something on the internet...from someone.",mupxkh,2021-04-21 02:34:27

"36 M

I had the 2nd shot of Moderna 24h ago. After 6 hours muscle ache at injection site. After another 3 hours I had these big chills especially in my legs,felt like I was freezing.
Slight fever after another hour.I had trouble sleeping because of general muscle ache + chills and head ache, took some ibuprofen and metamyzol and it made it bearable. These effects are still on now.",mupxkh,2021-04-21 11:03:33
Exactly why I mentioned that everyone will not have the same experience. Wishing you well as you recover!,mupxkh,2021-04-21 00:16:54
Ugh. Feeling unwell is horrible. I wish all quick recovery from here for you! When did you receive your 2nd shot?,mupxkh,2021-04-21 09:06:05
Did you have covid previously? I was told the first shot will only cause a bad reaction if you did.,mupxkh,2021-04-21 03:43:33
"I’m in my mid twenties (M), my first shot went the same. Never had covid previously to my knowledge (been tested 30+ times). Getting my second shot soon, hoping for the best :)",mupxkh,2021-04-21 07:09:56

"I don't even have the energy to read, because my first shot was a breeze, but I don't think it's an exaggeration to say the second shot yesterday almost killed me.  Fever over 103, worst body aches ever, horrible neck pain (up the side), incredible weakness and uncoordination, headache worse than a migraine, seeing spots,...
Even now that I hope the worst is over, I don't feel ""right"" in my own body, can't get comfortable to sleep (random shooting pain, mostly in joints and neck), losing feeling in hands, etc.
Had to piss in a bottle because I couldn't get up to use the bathroom...
I have historically been a huge vaccine supporter, but there's no way I'm letting my kid get one until they've been tested much, much, much more.
One of the worst days of my life...",muvye0,2021-04-21 05:32:47

"There should be a number for an advice nurse line through your drs office or insurance, that would be a good place to ask this question. I know that you can get a blood test right AFTER your shot, since I also had to deal with tight scheduling and called the advice nurse to make sure that it was ok (they said it was!)",mv8943,2021-04-21 06:30:29

I got my first shot yesterday and my arm started with mild pain then at night it hurt so bad I couldn't change my shirt either. I used a cold watered washcloth to help with the pain then pushed through moving my arm and massaging it. The next morning my arm was back to mild pain and right now (5pm) it's barely even sore. I only notice it when I reach for something now,muzide,2021-04-21 01:05:42
"Yep, two of my friends and I all had severe arm pain the first shot but on the second dose it was no problem. On the second dose I tried to really really make sure that my arm was relaxed when I got the injection and then I made sure to move it around a lot and I drank tons of water. Not sure if any one thing helped but that’s what I did.",muzide,2021-04-21 05:02:58
"My first one was awful! I was achy, tired, couldn't move my arm and had swollen lymph nodes. That all lasted *weeks.* I kept getting sent home from work for ""moving like a zombie.""

I just had my second dose yesterday and don't feel as bad physically, but I've been an emotional wreck and have had no appetite.",muzide,2021-04-21 16:25:47
Awesom thanks. I will try to do what you did.,muzide,2021-04-21 18:15:32
"Ugh, that's crazy. Hopefully it's nothing serious. I was reading up on swollen lymph nodes because I have one too (on top of my left collarbone), and it sounds like it can take a while to clear up.  I got my 2nd shot on Sunday 4/18, and felt terrible all day yesterday 4/19, but the most annoying/painful thing was the swollen lymph node. At one point, I moved wrong and I almost cried at how much it hurt. 😥",muxjd0,2021-04-20 21:18:13
"Yeah, you should get it checked after 6 weeks and your doctor may or may not want to send you for more testing, based on any other symptoms that you might have. 

It sounds like your doctor feels confident that its related to the vaccine and isn't dangerous. If you disagree, you can specifically ask for the doctor to note their refusal of further testing in your chart, and get a second opinion. 

Lymph nodes do sometimes take a long time to heal though. I have one in my neck that has been swollen for 23 years. I've also had strep throat and scarlet fever a few times and it took several months for mine to settle down after those infections. My doctors didn't worry about it because they had a logical explanation for the inflammation. If there wasn't an obvious answer like a recent vaccination or infection, they would be doing a lot of tests looking for answers.",muxjd0,2021-04-21 16:21:39
"Any improvement? I'm 12 weeks out, had an ultrasound done and it found  that my lymph node was "" irregular and not suspicious, likely related to vaccine"" dr. Wants me to wait another 4 weeks or get rechecked. Wondering if I need a second opi ions. 16 weeks seems long amd I'm currently in neck/ shoulder pain...",muxjd0,2021-05-04 06:08:07
"I had a horrible reaction to the second dose too! I was out for a couple days with fever and body aches, headaches for over a week. I'm hoping this is just a prolonged reaction since I had such an intense reaction to the vaccine. My lymph nodes were only painful for a day or two. No pain since and their moveable, kinda rubbery but not hard. I hope yours clear up fast!",muxjd0,2021-04-20 21:22:49
Mine is also on my left collarbone (injection side),muxjd0,2021-04-20 21:23:20
Thank you for this!! My doctor seemed confident that it was the vaccine but we will continue to monitor it.,muxjd0,2021-04-21 16:56:09
"No improvement! 12 weeks is wild. I will say I do not have pain, I swear sometimes I have phantom pain (when I'm over thinking it) but most days it's painless and no other symptoms. Do you have any other symptoms besides neck pain?",muxjd0,2021-05-04 12:48:02
None whatsoever.,muxjd0,2021-05-04 14:02:42
"That's pretty much a good sign! My doctor said to be aware of fevers, having flu like symptoms, and any extra swelling. My lymph node is about the size of a spherical cheerio and has stated that size for the whole 10 weeks",muxjd0,2021-05-04 15:10:12
