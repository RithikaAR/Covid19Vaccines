Post Pfizer Vaccine Experience,299,lam09i,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/lam09i/post_pfizer_vaccine_experience/,1176,"Hey guys,
I received the Pfizer Vaccine (only the first dose so far) and am looking for others to share experiences, mainly experience a week after the shot as well as related to physical activity and working out.
I did feel a little soreness in the shoulder the day after but felt overall alright. However it's been over a week now and I feel generally more tired at all times, especially at the gym. I am a hobby bodybuilder and am In the sport for 5 years now. Ever since I received the vaccine, I feel like my workouts have been short, way more exhausting and weaker. Has anyone else experienced this?",1612264324.0,2021-02-02 03:12:04

How long can you delay getting second dose?,37,la24nc,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/la24nc/how_long_can_you_delay_getting_second_dose/,53,"I am supposed to go back and get my second dose today, but I am scheduled to have surgery this week and I am expecting to have a pretty bad reaction to the vaccine dose (I felt terrible for a few days with the first dose, and everyone has told me second dose will likely feel worse).
Does anyone know how long I can wait before going back for my second dose? If I can wait 2 more weeks I’ll have healed a bit from surgery and can use my down time off work to get through it. It has already been 3 weeks since my first shot.",1612211868.0,2021-02-01 12:37:48
Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Obsevations,50,l96w0h,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l96w0h/pfizerbiontech_vaccine_obsevations/,87,"I (44/M) was inoculated around 6:45 in the evening on Wednesday, Jan. 27 with the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine. I received the vaccine at a mass inoculation site at our local Expo Center. I am technically part of the 1b group, but was able to get the shot at the tail end of the 1a group, due to some wrangling by my employer.

I experienced some dizziness and splitting headache about 10 minutes after the injection (in right deltoid) and mild pain at injection site, while I was waiting in the 15 minute observation waiting area after the shot was given. On the 28th, I felt some nausea and dizziness again about 14 hours later and another bad headache. The nausea and dizziness dissipated shortly and the headache later in the afternoon. The injection site was slightly more painful. On Friday, 29th and Saturday, 30th, basically no symptoms. Counting my blessings.

Why I choose to get shot?

1) Health Concerns. I have some underlying conditions (Asthma, Hypertension and a few others).

2) Opportunity. I put my name in early with employer, got the call, drove to the site.

3) Research. If you read the trial data on the vaccine BNT162b2 it was 95% effective against COVID-19, 7 days after the 2nd dose: https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?articleTools=true

What makes me apprehensive about this shot?

1) We do not know the long term side effects of the vaccine. Should I wait until this is determined?

2) Rabies, Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, and Zika have all had vaccines created with mRNA (all of which I have not had), yet the #1 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and #2 (modeRNA) vaccines use this new delivery system of mRNA for vaccination. Is mRNA truly safe for humans? 

3) The trial lasted 111 days (July 27 to Nov 14, 2020), so does that mean the vaccine was created in 4 months 17 days (139 days) minus the initial testing on humans, if you use the day of March 11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this a pandemic? My memory tells me Dr. Anthony Fauci on many press conferences, said it would take a year to a year and a half to create a vaccine, yet Pfizer-BioNTech did it just under 5 months and also created a vaccine with a 95% efficacy. It almost seems to good to be true? 

4) LNP (Lipid Nanoparticles) is such a new technology in medicine, relatively speaking, it is also worrisome the effects this will have on our bodies with this vaccine?

5) Why is there such a heavy push to get vaccinated by the media and political affiliations? And why all of a sudden IS THIS vaccine free to anyone, but other vaccines are not? Who is paying for all of this?

6) If I wait until the summer when it is rolled out, will there still be enough available? Will there be a syringe shortage, as some are talking about? Will there be some other issue that arises, that I will not be able to get the shot, when the opportunity to get it is now?

Finally, some observations about the evening I received my shot:

1) There were some 40 booths set up, one after the other at my site, giving out the vaccines. It was not very private or HIPPA regulated, as one would normally see in a hospital setting and maybe this is because the government (ie. tax payer) is on the hook for the shots and privacy is not a concerned.

2) The nurse giving me the shot was (to my understanding) not a licensed nurse but a student nurse from the local university...not sure if this matters or not? My muscle of my arm had some spasms as it was being injected by her.

3) Before I got my shot, I had to wait a few minutes for it to be drawn up. The problem with this was, I had no idea what was injected in me, as I never saw the vial the “vaccine” was drawn out of. It was very much like the scene at the end of “The Wizard of Oz”, when the wizard came out from behind the curtain; a different nurse came from behind me through these make-shift booth curtains to hand the student nurse a syringe. I asked to see the syringe for any information on it, but all it had on it was a lot #. The nurse said to me, “this is your last chance to back out.” In conversation with her prior while I was waiting, she had told me she had yet to get the vaccine, but it was offered to her as part of the nursing program. She was still undecided to get hers.

4) As I was rushed to the booth, I was handed a 6 page document about the vaccine, that I did not really get to read until I got home later. Maybe it was my naivety about the vaccine, but I did not realize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was not approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) but rather fell under an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) by the FDA. Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. READ EVERYTHING YOU ARE HANDED BEFORE YOU TAKE THE VACCINE, SO YOU CAN MAKE THE BEST INFORMED DECISION. I might have waited on getting it, had I known this little snippet about it, regardless of the claimed 95% efficacy.

I will update my post, if I experience any more symptoms. 

I am scheduled Feb. 17 for Dose #2. Am praying this was the right decision, despite my objections above.

Good Luck to those thinking about this difficult decision themselves and their families. It was not an easy one for me, even despite having already gotten the vaccine.",1612104893.0,2021-01-31 06:54:53
Delayed Symptoms From 1st Dose 5 Days Later,67,l8skoz,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l8skoz/delayed_symptoms_from_1st_dose_5_days_later/,123,"I thought I would share my experience with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in case it's more common than I think. I had gotten it last week on Thursday (Jan 21st) and the only early-on symptom I had that I could confirm was from the vaccine was arm soreness at the injection site which was mostly just the day after and really not bad.

Fast forward to Tuesday, I started having really bad chills for a couple of hours while out eating with my Fiance, and checked my temperature when I got home and I was 99.1 (after drinking water so probably actually higher). My temperature stayed in that range for 2 days (Tues and Weds) along with the chills and I clocked it as high as 99.5 when intentionally avoiding water for 30+ minutes to get an accurate reading (yes, I hydrate a LOT). I also had bad chest pain, likely from muscle aches and tightness, and I was pretty convinced I had contacted COVID from my Fiance's coworker who tested positive a couple days prior.

My Fiance and I got tested and both came back negative so I can only assume this was a very delayed reaction to the vaccine, but I felt mostly better by Wednesday so all in all it just lasted about 2 days.",1612061387.0,2021-01-30 18:49:47
2nd dose side effects,143,l8e8kj,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l8e8kj/2nd_dose_side_effects/,230,"First dose was uneventful except for very mild soreness at the injection site. Got my 2nd dose today at 11:30am. Approx 10pm tonight I started feeling some soreness at the injection site (left arm). Over the next hour (now!), I’ve developed chills, joint pain all over my upper body but especially in my left shoulder and arm, and mild headache. Just took some Advil PM and hoping to get some sleep. Will update in the morning.

Edit: chills suddenly stopped about an hour after they started last night and joint pain started subsiding. Feeling pretty normal this morning so far.

2nd edit: day after second vaccine knocked me on my ass! About an hour after I reported “feeling pretty normal” in the morning, I got chills again and my whole body was achy. I was lethargic, had achy joints and a mild headache. Slept a lot off and on most of the day and drank lots of water to stay hydrated. By about 8pm I was feeling much better. It is now 2 days post vaccine and this morning I feel completely fine again except for some mild soreness in the vaccination arm.",1612011334.0,2021-01-30 04:55:34

First dose experience 33/M,48,l7vmec,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l7vmec/first_dose_experience_33m/,51,"I jut got yesterday my first dose, feeling fine after 30 minutes, when I start driving home I started to feel dizzy, when i got home I was very dizzy and with a severe headache I couldn't see light or hear mid level noise without pain also started to feel tired , I just took a tylenol and went to sleep the rest of the day, 
Today second day, feeling fine just pain in the arm

Edit: I took the second dose today I'm only feeling very tired, I had sleeped all day lrt see how it goes tomorrow

Edit: i don't remember how many days after the second dose everything is going good,  a week ago  I was close to a infected friend, he didn't know at the time hw thought it was allergies, and didn't get infected I tested myself two times already and both came negative. I'm still protecting myself with mask and taking all the precautions but it is good to know that you have a certain amount of protection. Sorry thought it was worth mentioning this.

weird side effect after second dose,32,l7d3ao,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l7d3ao/weird_side_effect_after_second_dose/,21,"this was just so crazy i had to share...

i got my second dose of the pfizer vaccine on tuesday, and for the most part felt fine the next day.  even the arm soreness was diminished from the first shot.  last night, however, approximately 30 hours after the shot, i decided to have a snack of chips and salsa.  these were left over from a meal the night before in which i had eaten a ton of both without any problem.  

only three dipped chips into my snack, my tongue started burning SEVERELY.  felt like my mouth was on fire.  i have a very high tolerance for spicy food and this was just some jalapeno based salsa that, as i mentioned, i had a lot of the night before and, if anything, was disappointed with how mild it was.  not so the next night.  my face turned red, my eyes were tearing, and no matter what i tried to do to ease the burn - bread, milk, ice cream - it lasted for nearly 30 minutes.  never experienced anything like that, and i eat habaneros, ghost peppers, etc, whenever i have the opportunity.

the only thing that could have done this is a reaction to the vaccine.  i did some research on capsaicin-induced mouth burn as a possible immune response and couldn't find anything but mentions of spicy food as being good for strengthening the immune system, but that's about it.  it was so weird.  i want to try it again tonight to see if the same thing will happen, but i honestly don't want to go through that again.

anyone heard of this or a physiological mechanism to explain it?  i had a bunch of co-workers who got the second dose today, so i have asked them to try tasting some salsa tomorrow in a mini experiment.  i'll report back if others notice the same effect or i am an isolated case...",1611907013.0,2021-01-28 23:56:53

I received my first dose on 1/20, and today is 1/24. 

\-On the 20th, my arm felt pretty sore by the end of the day, but when I woke up I didn't feel any soreness. I felt a little out of breath for the few hours after my vaccine. 

\-The past few days I have felt really tired, but I'm not sure if it's due to the vaccine or just general stress. I also started having stomach issues today - nausea, etc. I'm also not sure if this is due to the vaccine.

I will be getting the second dose on 2/12 - so I will update more then!",1611554058.0,2021-01-24 21:54:18
Second dose,46,kx253z,PfizerVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/kx253z/second_dose/,50,"*UPDATE - I survived. Last night was rough, but this morning I was fine (other than being exhausted from lack of sleep and a sore arm from the injection site). My supervisor had the opposite experience; she was fine all day yesterday but had to go home within two hours of being at work due to fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Our program director experienced these side effects after her first dose, but nothing after her second. My advice: try to schedule the shots on days when you are able to rest afterward and the following day; it seems like side effects vary but it would be safer to give yourself some time to recuperate :)

I just received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine this afternoon at 3:30pm. I felt fine immediately after, and figured I would have a pretty uneventful experience like I did the first time around (had no side effects except for a sore arm the next day). At around 7pm, I started to get a headache that got progressively worse. I laid down for a bit and fell asleep, only to wake up a few hours later with a headache, strong cramps similar to period cramps, and a low grade fever (99.1 temp). I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience so far, or if they had to miss work from side effects of the second dose? I’m hoping I’ll be able to sleep it off and be back to normal 8 hours from now when I leave for work.",1610644033.0,2021-01-14 09:07:13
