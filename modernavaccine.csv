Any data on immunity from the first dose of Moderna?,224,lt3gj0,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/lt3gj0/any_data_on_immunity_from_the_first_dose_of/,186,"Interested to know the efficacy/efficiency in terms of immunity from the first dose. Having a hard time finding reliable data that isn‚Äôt paywalled.

For the record, I absolutely 100% still plan on getting the second dose. It would still be some relief to know how immune I am in the timeframe between my 1st and 2nd.

Edit: Since this is pinned, for those who don‚Äôt want to read thru all the comments - consensus seems to be roughly 75-90% **two weeks after** receiving the first dose. Definitely a bit of controversy in those figures tho. Point is, keep masking up, social distancing, etc etc as if you still have 0 protection!! ‚ÄúFull‚Äù immunity (or at least maximum effectiveness) is achieved about 2-3 weeks after second dose.",1614390758.0,2021-02-26 17:52:38

The rash coincided with a sore throat and minor (wet) cough/chest aches that has not resolved as of today (day 12). No fever or other symptoms. Tested negative by lateral flow every day since vaccine including today. Tested negative by PCR today as well.

Well, I have had some normal days sprinkled in but mostly I have felt strange/bad. I have IBS so I thought my burning stomach was a symptom but I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs from the vaccine since I have never had this pain before in all the years since my IBS diagnosis. 

I don‚Äôt sleep well. I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm going to have an anxiety attack just as I start to doze off. And that brings me to the main event - I had a severe anxiety attack (my first ever) and it was so bad I lost feeling in my hands and feet from hyperventilating. My mom had to call an ambulance but the EMTs could tell it was an anxiety attack. They said they get calls for them all the time now. News to me. All my vitals were normal. Blood, urine, CT (because of stomach pain) all completely normal. I try to tell myself I‚Äôm ok even tho I feel bad a lot. 

I‚Äôm weak. I can‚Äôt do things that I used to do. I can‚Äôt wash my dogs. I can‚Äôt stand to cook dinner. I need to rest a lot because I ache and just feel plain awful. 

My hands tingle. I have no idea what this means. EMT told me it was an anxiety symptom. I have never had this sensation before. I try to ignore it and most of the time I can Jedi mind trick it away. 

I disassociate. I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm in a dream or out of my body and ‚Äúlooking in‚Äù at my life. It never lasts longer than a few seconds but it is weird and sometimes scary. 

My bowels are a mess. Everyday I have stomach discomfort. I have IBS but I never had stomach trouble every day. Now I get nauseous after eating and have days with no appetite. Everything I eat comes out ‚Äúsoft‚Äù (sorry for TMI but I feel the need to clarify) but not diarrhea. 

I‚Äôm diagnosed with Migraines with aura and I take sumatriptan for them. I had A HORRIBLE migraine that my meds didn‚Äôt even touch!!! It lasted 8 hours before I could even get out of bed. My migraines are few and far between thanks to my progestin only birth control so this was definitely odd and happened the next day after my SEVERE anxiety attack. 

I have daily headaches but I‚Äôve had those my whole life. So I can‚Äôt really be used as a litmus for any of you that now have headaches. 

I just want to go back to normal. Or just at least have my strength back. Please someone tell me they had a similar experience and are normal again and that I have hope. I took the vaccine to help protect everyone around me and I really don‚Äôt want to regret it but I‚Äôm totally miserable right now.

Since my first dose, I‚Äôve been getting regular headaches that have been reasonably severe and bordering on migraine territory (as determined by my doctor). They come along with vision disturbances, light sensitivity and nausea which I‚Äôm very not used to.

It could very well be coincidental as I‚Äôve been living somewhere new where pressure changes are a factor and am in a new position at work that‚Äôs more stressful with more screen time but I‚Äôve been stressed and in screen heavy environments before... So to me the timing seems pretty sus.

The posts I read on here were a little bit Doom-n-Gloom so I'd like to give a first hand account as I go through it.

DAY 1  
No pain taking the vaccine (I'm not afraid of needles, but genuinely not one bit of pain). Little bit numb after an hour. 
Hour six I started getting a little, uh, whimsical? Forgot some stuff at work, didn't feel super fit to drive home. My arm felt like I had been punched in the shoulder two days ago. Got home, had a pretty OK time of it (shoulder slightly worse wear) until around 1am, by which point I was in bed watching [Quail Farming](https://youtu.be/4AhScEGKE5Y) videos on YouTube.

DAY 2  
1am. So cold! Holy crab so cold. I finally feel like I understand what ""I've got chills they're multiplying"" meant. Do my rustic-Norwegian-style survival trick of breathing under my duvet. Do try at home! Not out in the wilderness though you will super die. Too much moisture if it's Really-Freaking-Cold‚Ñ¢. Snuggle up to the missus for that sweet heat. She doesn't feel super warm. I may be experiencing cold without being cold.  
3am. Heating up little by little, and gently drift off to sleep. Dreamt about [Green Hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenHell) for some reason..  
5am. Holy craaabs so warm! And ouch! Slight headache, back hurts, my muscles ache. Do bones hurt? I'm pretty sure bones hurt. Lay in bed until 8 feeling sorry for myself. It felt a lot like being super hung over to those of you who know what that feels like.  
8am. LPT: water kicks ass. Not only do you need it to live, you can wash yourself with it, and like, *drown* people with it. Crazy flexible substance. Have 1g of paracetamol. Still crazy warm, but the pain's subsiding at 9am (nowish.)

I also got tinnitus, more than the one I already had (old one was one ear, this one feels in the center, or both ears).

Eight days in, most muscle pain is gone, not the one in the legs, the one swollen leg is still swollen. Not a lot, but it's noticeable. Decided to get checked. They did some blood tests, checked for thrombosis despite other typical symptoms missing. All negative (yay!). Also, I can't deal with more than 10 minutes walks that I start feeling tired and very heavy legs. The ""new"" tinnitus is still there. They told me that it can happen with this vaccine.

Today, twelve days in. _Maybe_ a little less pain, leg still a bit swollen, same tinnitus.

Two week anniversary,3,noyfmi,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/noyfmi/two_week_anniversary/,1,"Hubs (40m) and I (36f), both rubenesque individuals, have almost hit the two week mark since our second shot. I experienced more symptoms than he did, as I guess is pretty normal. After the first shot, we both felt a bit tired the day after, but nothing after that. About 9 days later, I woke up with an itchy bump about the size of a quarter below the injection site, and through the day it grew to cover my whole upper arm. Super swollen, tough and itchy skin and very warm to the touch, like a hefty sunburn, the heat was all over my upper back and chest. That went away after 4 days, then I was fine. I also got my period a week early the day I woke up with an itchy arm, which is very unusual for me. 

The second shot brought on the swollen arm again the day after, with the added bonus of an ache in my arm pit. I also experienced a fairly low fever, fluctuating  between 99 and 100.7 for almost two days, a bit of a headache, and some dizziness when I walked or got up too quickly. Hubs felt OK the day after, but on the third day he started feeling really tired and had the dizziness, too. Never got a fever, but had some body aches. We drank a TON of water, and thanks to another post here, I stocked up on those IV hydration packets ahead of time which I think really helped hubs a lot. He's not a huge fan of drinking water, and once we got the water ratio right (20oz per one packet, if anyone's wondering), he was into those. I'm pretty good about water consumption, but I drank them, as well, to give me a boost. I've never peed so much in my life! 

I'm so happy to be vaccinated! I will continue to wear my mask when around a bunch of folk cuz the past year has taught me ya can't trust some of them, but I feel less anxious. Plus, hoping now that my MIL will stay away from us, for fear of ""shedding"" on her...",1622478469.0,2021-05-31 09:27:49

The chest pain is causing no underlying issues, my pulse seems normal and I can move about, but the pain also comes and goes.

I \*rarely\* get headaches and do not have a severe allergy to pollen. I want to share my experience so far in case anyone else can relate or can offer any advice.

I received my 1st dose on April 28th. My symptoms were a sore arm and fatigue. These side effects went away in about 72 hours. 

I received my 2nd dose on May 26th and my symptoms have been very bad. 

Day 1: I got the vaccine in the evening and afterwards, I made sure to stay active and hydrated; I drank about 6 cups of water before going to bed and I went on an hour-long walk to keep my arms moving. Within the first 5 hours, my first side effects were a sore arm and general thirst. I slept for about 6 hours.

Day 2: I made an effort to stay vigilant about my hydration but about 22 hours after this vaccine (4:30 pm), I started to feel extremely fatigued, had a headache, and intense lower back pain. I drank extra water, ate some fruit, laid down, and took a nap. I woke up about an hour later and still felt very fatigued and had no appetite so I decided to go to take some Tylenol and go to bed. Around 6:30 pm, I woke up with chills, sweats, a fever, intense arm and back pain, a headache, and continued fatigue. My whole body felt very heavy and ached. I fell back asleep for 14 hours.

Day 3: I woke up feeling refreshed but still fatigued. I went on a 5-mile hike, ate food, drank coffee, and stayed hydrated throughout the day. In the evening, I noticed a small rash on my arm where I had received the shot that just looked like dry skin. 

Day 4: I felt normal for most of the day. In the afternoon, I felt more tired than normal and laid outside reading for a few hours. My energy levels were fairly low for most of the day but I continued to stay hydrated and make sure I ate throughout the day even though I had little appetite.

Day 5 (today): I've had an unrelenting headache that's been growing throughout the day, fatigued to a point where I don't want to leave my bed for more than 30 minutes at a time, small spells of dizziness, little appetite, sensitivity to light, a mild fever, and aches from my neck to my lower back. I took Tylenol to try to ease the symptoms as well as over the counter allergy medication since there is a lot of pollen in the air right now.

First shot:
First shot wasn‚Äôt too terrible. I had a little headache and some fatigue for about a day or two then it was gone sore arm came strong on day 2 and left day 4. Exactly 7 days after the shot my deltoid swelled up like someone stuffed a mf baseball under my skin and it was hot. Went to ER and they said just take Benadryl and go with god. The next day swelling went down but with the reduced swelling came a wholeee lotta muscle twitching that went on for about 2 days and so I went to the ER again. With a whole lotta hydration and electrolyte replenishment, it soon went away and I was bout 100% after day 9 or 10 of the shot.

Shot two:
My wife got her second shot a day before I did and the night of hers she woke up with chills and shakin and all that fun stuff so I knew I was probably gonna have about the same reaction. I got the shot at 8am and I felt a little groggy a few hours later but mostly fine a lotta little naps is what the day consisted of. Was afraid to go to bed at night because I knew what was coming for me and sure enough once 1AM rolled by I started shaking purty good. I‚Äôve gotten sick before in my life but NEVER experienced chills so that was new. I wouldn‚Äôt say I felt cold but damn I needed 4 blankets and 1 weighted blanket on top of me and I still wasn‚Äôt comfy. Mind you the room was like 78 degrees. Along with the shakes came some gnarly ache n‚Äô bakes on the body (specifically my lower back like holy shit I already got chronic back issues but this felt like when I first injured myself years ago) didn‚Äôt get a lick of sleep the whole night and met the sunrise with a fever and the back pain. Popped me some 600mg ibuprofen and it soon went away. That was about the worst of it (so far lol)

I was very skeptical about getting the shot since its inception but ya know... yolo and all that so idk how I‚Äôm feeling about the whole thing. Kinda glad I got it because I have the sense of security and feeling close to normalcy but man, I sure am uncertain about the future and any long term side effects. Anywho.. wasn‚Äôt terrible. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend for or against it. I‚Äôd just say think about everything, do as much research as you can handle and then just deal with the rest as it comes. Meh.

Experience 48 hours after first shot,5,no8ieo,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/no8ieo/experience_48_hours_after_first_shot/,3,"Hi everyone,

 I just wanted to tell you about my experience with the vaccine, 48 hours after the first injection.

I'm 27, male. Slightly overweighted.

In Belgium, if you are young and you want to be vaccinated, you‚Äôre put on a waiting list and when a place becomes available you‚Äôre called. You cant chose the vaccine you‚Äôre gonna receive, but people under 40 don't get AstraZeneca or Johnson&amp;Johnson. The one that was offered to me was the Moderna, but I would have preferred the Pfizer.

 Right after the injection, I had a little panic attack, and I was afraid that I would be fainting or something. But it's just because I'm so anxious.

For the next few hours, I would wait for the side effects, especially after everything I read on Reddit. But I got nothing. That same evening, I hesitated to drink alcohol with my friends, I didn't know if it could be mixed with the vaccine. But I did, I had few beers and some rum, I didn't feel any difference.

After 48 hours, I don't have any strange sensation, and I don't feel anything special. My injected arm hurts a bit when I do wide movements, that's all.

 If I feel anything else, I'll do an update.",1622399921.0,2021-05-30 11:38:41

After several of my friends got 2nd dates closer to their first one than mine I counted the days between my vaccination dates: 45. 

Every article I can find tells me that Moderna recommends getting the 2nd dose 28 to 42 days after the first one. That's quite a large window, so I'm assuming that there's a good reason they made the cut at 42 days and not at 43 or 45. 
Does anyone know the specific study results? What difference do these three additional dates make? 

Additional info: I can't just book an earlier date. I already had my first dose and the booking software only allows me to cancel the remaining date. Canceling to book a new 2nd date would be a very high risk, as there are no new dates available at the moment and getting one has become much more difficult now that everyone is allowed to get vaccinated (earlier it was only people with a higher risk of complications or exposure).",1622412000.0,2021-05-30 15:00:00

- May 29th: second wave of hives. Neck, head, and left side body. Went to ER. They have no diagnosis. Extended my steroid prescription and gave me a different antihistamine. 

I have no known allergies, and have never had hives. I'm getting mixed opinions from medical professionals and being referred to an allergist or derm. I'm worried about weeks of doctor appointments, medicine, and tests to be told they aren't sure. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Or any resources related to covid vaccine, moderns, and hives days after the first dose? 

I've already had COVID in January - if that helps.

Nausea n weak for like 4 days. Went to the ER 3 times in that week. Did blood work and all was fine. Every little aches and pain now im scared it leads to blood clot. 2 weeks later and the left fingers and toes feel a bit crampy. I also had the shot on my left side.,1622364593.0,2021-05-30 01:49:53

- Persistent fatigue. Not all bad (my Fitbit tells me I'm getting about 90 minutes extra sleep every night) but it's not so good during the day when I have constant brain fog and can't seem to remember words and people's names as well as I usually do.
- loss of appetite 
- dull headache
- achy joints

Also (but now resolved)

- Angry rash and ""COVID arm"", only for about 24 hours 10 days after the shot.

"My experience, the good and bad",15,nn0yep,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nn0yep/my_experience_the_good_and_bad/,8,"Just thought I (31,f) would share my experience with everyone.  Getting the vaccine can be scary and if I can put someone‚Äôs mind at ease then I‚Äôm happy to. I apologize in advance for my grammar and anything else here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in a bit of a hurry typing this out on my phone. 

I got the first dose 28 April and the only symptom I had was a really sore arm for a couple of days. I was surprised because I am usually wiped out for several days after the flu vaccine, so I thought this would do the same. 

I got my second dose this Wednesday 26 May at 11:00. I felt fine but noticed my arm hurting immediately. I brushed it off and just expected some aches and pains in the upcoming hours. Well, at around 7:30 I suddenly felt sweaty and like I was going to pass out. My ears started ringing and I knew I was going to be sick. I went to the bathroom and had diarrhea pretty badly. I was COVERED in sweat and I am not someone who sweats a lot. Following this my ears stopped ringing and I felt a little better but my stomach began feeling upset, like indigestion.  I thought I would need my strength for whatever was coming so I ate a small, bland dinner and drank a bunch of water followed by a peppermint tea. During this time all the other symptoms started creeping in. I had horrible chills, an intense flare of Reynauds, sweats and body aches. Around 8:30 my stomach started feeling really bad. I got major indigestion and knew I would be throwing up soon. I was surprised by all of these gastro symptoms because I know a ton of vaccinated people and not one of them mentioned stomach troubles as a side effect. Sure enough, around 9:00 I was puking my guts out and dry heaving by the end of it. Every time I tried to drink any water I ended up puking. This went on for the following couple of hours. I was beginning to fear dehydration and knew that would make everything else worse. 

I fell asleep and tossed and turned until around 2:00am. I felt sooo thirsty so I started taking really tiny sips of water every 10-20 minutes. After an hour of keeping the water down, I was basically overjoyed knowing I wouldn‚Äôt need to go to the hospital for an IV. I ended up being awake until about 4am and had about 20 ounces of water during that time. 

The next day I still had indigestion but was able to keep fluids and food down just fine so I made sure I stayed really hydrated and snacked on bland foods throughout the day. My temp fluctuated a little but mostly stayed around 100.7. I was sore to the bone, the aches could be felt in every joint, muscle and anything in between. I was freezing and bundled in several layers all day and my head was pounding. I‚Äôve had colds that produced less severe symptoms. 

By nightfall, I felt my fever break after a short nap and I no longer had the chills. The indigestion was still there and I felt a pressure in my chest. This heightened my anxiety because I thought maybe it had something to do with my heart. And of course if you google it, you‚Äôll see that symptoms of a heart attack can be burping and chest pain or tightness. After the reports of myocarditis I was just really worried this could get ugly. I decided to sleep it off and see what happened the next day. Well today is Friday and I woke up feeling a lot better. The chest pressure was present when I woke up but resolved a couple of hours later and coincidentally so did my indigestion haha. All other symptoms are pretty much gone, I‚Äôve been eating and drinking like normal and even took my pups on a walk. I feel a little weak and like I need to take it a bit easy, but overall feel WAY better. 

Today also happened to be the day I received news about a long time family friend who passed away from Covid just last night. My heart is broken, but I am happy I made this choice to get the vaccine and I‚Äôd do it again in a heartbeat even after the most miserable 48 hours of my life.",1622246287.0,2021-05-28 16:58:07
24M Moderna Experience,6,nn7mnv,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nn7mnv/24m_moderna_experience/,0,"TLDR: 1st shot: Sore arm for two days, 3-5 day leg pain amplification, 3 day headache(potentially). 2nd shot: Sore arm for a day, low grade fever for 9 hours.


Before getting vaccinated, I browsed this sub constantly. I wanted to know what to expect and before I got vaccinated, I decided I would do a report of my experience after the fact. 

First shot: Between the some of the terrible reactions I had seen on here and conspiracy theories stated by my mom (even if I didn't believe them, they still floated around in my head), I was pretty anxious going into it. I had the first shot on 4/23 around 6 PM. About four hours later I had some arm pain when it was raised to 90¬∞, to be in line with my shoulder basically. The next morning the arm pain continued, but more intensely, and I felt it at about 45¬∞ now.  This lasted for about a day, it was greatly reduced the next day, and was back to normal afterwards. I also had pain in the upper left leg. I had pain there from the week before the shot, and this amplified it a good amount. Before, I would only notice it if my leg was in a certain position, but after the first shot I felt it when sitting down, laying down, bending etc. I had to do these activities more slowly than usual. The amplified leg pain lasted for about 3 days then gradually retuned to the before vaccinated level over the week. I also had an extremely mild headache about two days after for two days. I get headaches a decent amount, so this could be a coincidence, however the ones I get are usually full blown, where I need headache medication to function throughout the day. These were so mild, I didn't take anything for them at first, however it later developed into my usual headache, so I took something for it. Later on in the week I noticed a lymph node under my armpit, it wasn't painful but I first felt it while showering. And about six days after the shot, I believe I was starting to get a cold sore, the sensation felt familiar from when I had it as a kid, but I used orajel and it was gone the next day.

Second shot: I had very little vaccine anxiety going into this one as my anxiety was taken up by some work issues. Based on what everyone said, I was prepared for the worst with this one and had just hoped it would be a similar experience to the first. Got it on May 21st, the sore arm came a bit earlier, after two hours. The next morning, I still had a sore arm, but it wasn't as sore as it was with the first dose. Around 21 hours after the shot, I had a low grade fever that fluctuated between 99.1-100.4. I took Tylenol, had a cold compress for a while, and took a cold shower a few hours later, it finally returned to a normal temperature 9 hours after it had started. No leg pain flare up, no headache, but it's been a week and that has been all.

As far as I know, I never had COVID. I followed the subs advice and drank a lot of water + Gatorade. I also moved my arm A LOT more pre and post shot for the second one, so maybe that does reduce the pain.",1622264677.0,2021-05-28 22:04:37

1. Did you have a history of joint pain before taking the vaccine?

2. How long did it take to wear off - assuming it did? If it hasn‚Äôt worn off yet how long have you been living with it?

3. How bad was it, what couldn‚Äôt you do?

4. What is your age and sex? If you don‚Äôt mind sharing.

Still in pain two weeks after second dose :( thoughts?,17,nmq2x4,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nmq2x4/still_in_pain_two_weeks_after_second_dose_thoughts/,27,"hello! I'm (21F) a little scared to write this because I'm afraid of hearing horror stories, but I'm getting scared that these side effects (?) may not be normal/healthy/connected to the vax. I got my second dose of Moderna on May 14. The next day I was sicker than I've been in a very long time (vomiting bile 1st thing in the morning, low-mid grade fever, generally very weak and sleeping all day). I took a shower and started to feel a lot better the next day, but still not 100% normal. This was all expected.

For the past two weeks or so, my joint pain has been extreme. It seems to be in the places where there are lots of lymph nodes (shoulders, neck, elbows, wrists, hands, hips, knees, ankles, feet). I can barely walk in the morning and before bed. When it first started, it was mostly concentrated to one area at a time (meaning: it started at my right knee, then the next day it would be my right arm instead, then later in the day it might spread to my left shoulder, then the next day it would hit the lymph nodes in my throat, etc). Now, it seems to be hitting everywhere equally. During the day it seems a little more mild. The pain decreases if I'm taking ibuprofen regularly. It sort of feels like my entire body is cramped up, or (how I imagine) aggressive arthritis would feel like. I'm pretty active but I haven't been able to go on my daily walks regularly because my knees hurt too much.

I'm very careful about COVID safety, but I did meet a friend for coffee yesterday and we were allowed to take off our masks if fully vaccinated. I was feeling this bad for a while, though, so I don't think that's the cause. My family is not getting the vaccine unfortunately but I think they do generally follow the mask guidelines for my rural area. There aren't many cases where I live right now.

Also, I did get my Nexplanon birth control implant removed 2 days before getting my second dose (05/12). I've looked online and no one else seems to be having this problem. I'm really scared. Is anyone else experiencing this? Does it sound like it could be side effects from the vaccine? What should I do?",1622206244.0,2021-05-28 05:50:44

Here is my experience. 

First dose: arm was very sore, pain probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. Didn‚Äôt want to move it much or sleep on the left side. Felt a little itchy on back and neck but no rash. 

Second dose: arm pain was much less this time a 3 out of 10. Barely noticeable. I did arm circles after getting the vaccine and I drank lots of water and sports drink before and after. I did not have any alcohol or caffeine 48 hours before the jab. Only other symptom was fatigue. No fever, chills, or body aches. 

I also noticed after both doses I got a little bit of acne like bumps. On the first dose I got some acne sore that I could feel on my back when I lay down but went away after a day or so. And on the second dose I got a whitehead acne on my leg and small one on my face.

My mom‚Äôs a nurse and she said both my breathing and heart sounded fine. Anyone else experienced prolonged symptoms like this?? My anxiety is off the charts :(",1622195569.0,2021-05-28 02:52:49
2nd dose side effects came back after one week?,3,nmk9vc,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nmk9vc/2nd_dose_side_effects_came_back_after_one_week/,7,"36F, 2nd shot was 5/18.

**Days 1-4:** Starting 2-3 hours after the 2nd shot I then had 4 days of flu-like symptoms, super fatigued, bad chills and fever, and brutal insomnia that first night

**Days 5-7:** Feeling ""better"" and nearly back to normal besides some headaches and lingering muscle aches.

**Day 8:** Around noon yesterday a cold sore reared it's head and I started to get unexpectedly fatigued from doing basic house work. I chalked the fatigue up to the fact that I had gotten less than great sleep the night before and I figured the cold sore made sense due to the fact that I had almost gotten one about a week after the first vaccine shot (my acyclovir knocked it back).

**Day 9:** Today however, I have been absolutely DEAD TIRED. I am numbly exhausted and as of now (4pm) I feel fatigued worse than I did on days 1-4. I'm right at that level of the tired you get after getting no sleep for days on end. I got some great sleep last night and on the majority of the nights after the shot, so it doesn't make sense for me to feel this exhausted. My adderall (I have ADHD) hasn't even dented my fatigue which leads me to believe this is immune related and not sleep related.

Anyone else out there experiencing this?? I'm literally shocked at how dead I feel. All I want to do is go lay down and pass out.

UPDATE: I fell asleep from 5:30-9:30pm and then fell asleep again from 12:00-6:30am. Feel much better today as far as fatigue is concerned, but I am still a little foggy brained. Nothing nearly as bad as yesterday though! Maybe my system just got overwhelmed with processing the vaccine, my allergy season, and the cold sore all at the same time. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1622186065.0,2021-05-28 00:14:25

First shot was not what I expected. I was fully prepared for an all-on flare. I had zero inflammation issues. It‚Äôs hard to tell if I had a ‚Äúfever‚Äù because that fluctuates. I had a painfully sore injection arm. After 12-ish hours that breast was impossibly painful. That subsided after 3 days.

I had a number of the noted side-effects, but most were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for me. (Nausea, diarrhea, itchy rashes.) I have hidradenitis. That seemed to shut down for a bit.

The major abnormal was the abrupt menses. That arrived, unexpectedly, two weeks early. It was terrible cramping and spotting for 9 days. 

None of this was worse than a normal day in the life of an Owl! It might not be pleasant, but I feel that it is worth the extra bit of pain.

21/F, I'm just posting to let you know that it is possible to faint after a vaccine. I knew about tiredness/fatigue but nobody told me it could make me faint after few moments. 

I was waiting those 15 minutes after getting vaccinated and suddenly it was getting hot and I was getting weak. I told the nurse and on my way to the medical bed I was passing out real bad - losing vision, ringing in the ears. They put me on a bed, I was laying for a couple minutes and after that I got better. I was tired, but not passing out. I left and felt off for a day, but nothing else happened.

Now - I'm not ill, I wasn't anxious, I don't fear needles, I ate breakfast and my pressure was fine. Some people also were feeling weak, not only me. Not gonna speculate why that happened because I have no idea. Just wanted to inform you that it is possible, because I didn't know and it scared me.

This lady pulls out a silver ‚Äúcoin.‚Äù And plants it on my arm (I was like wtf is happening). The ‚Äúcoin‚Äù falls from my arm on the ground. I asked her if that was a magnet and she says yes.

The doctor told me that since i had covid at some point, it may be worse for me. That is accurate, and for 2.5 days after my first dose in April This year, i felt WORSE than covid, albeit obviously a shorter time period.

Antibody update, 9 months after first dose.",18,nkhk2e,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nkhk2e/enrolled_in_moderna_clinical_trial_antibody/,5,"I‚Äôll keep it short.  My wife and I enrolled in the Moderna Covid clinical trial way back when last year. We both had received the vaccine (luck) and not placebo, and we both sort of knew as we had the usual side effects as everybody else. 

Moderna unblinded us back in January, and took more blood. (Those 8 vials of blood every few months are fun!)

Since Moderna doesn‚Äôt give us any of the data, I decided to get my antibodies tested via SonoraQuest early April. Their spike protein assay also gives some sort of quantitative value of immunity, if you are ‚Äúreactive.‚Äù
I was reactive (ie, positive) with my value >20. Anything less than 1 is non-reactive. Wahoo for me, almost 8 months after the first dose.  Whatever does the value mean; maybe it refers to an antibody load.  What‚Äôs its significance? No idea. 

UArizona calls my wife a month ago (late April, early May?) and asks if she wants to donate a blood sample for their statewide antibody study. She says sure. She had done this many months ago, and I think the university is trying to re-test as many people as they can to track data. This is outside the study, of course, and anybody can participate‚Äîfor the most part. 

Her results took two weeks‚Ä¶negative for antibodies. Yikes. 

I‚Äôm sort of in disbelief. I review the UArizona docs, and they check for spike protein. 

I decide to get her checked at SonoraQuest on Saturday. Her results came back as ‚Äúreactive,‚Äù but her value was 1.6. Thats a big difference from mine! And since the cutoff is 1 for their assessment of reactive and non-reactive, it‚Äôs pretty close!

So, I figure the SonoraQuest lab test is likely slightly more sensitive than the University one. 

Well, what does this mean?  Other than bragging rights that I can make more antibodies than my wife?  Unsure. We called the research center, and they weren‚Äôt that helpful.  I guess it‚Äôs why we are in the study. By the way, I‚Äôm  pretty sure Pfizer and Moderna have similar long term efficacy since they‚Äôre very similar technologies. 

In closing. I think it‚Äôs likely that we will all be getting boosters at 9-12 months.  But, I‚Äôm not the research scientists looking at all the data‚Äîjust 2 data points.

After the first shot, my arm was super sore for a few days after, and aside from fatigue, this was my only reaction. My arm is sore again this time, as I expected. As I was lying on the couch, I could tell the super soreness was pretty localized to one spot, assumed it was the injection site. Also happened to notice it was swollen this time. No biggie, I‚Äôve heard of this happening. However, just now as I was getting ready for bed, I noticed the very sore, red lump is actually NOT at the injection spot. It‚Äôs actually 2-3 inches lower than the injection. Has anyone had this happen?? Is it something I should be concerned about? Because, not gonna lie, I‚Äôm a little concerned.

Got my first round of the moderna vaccine last month (on a Sunday), felt totally fine, no sore arm or anything. Then the following Saturday I woke up insanely sick. Pounding migraine, burning up and then cold sweats, nausea, spine pain, and just incredibly exhausted and sleepy. That lasted for 3 days and then on the 4th day totally fine.

I got my second dose today so I‚Äôm curious how this is gonna play out. My immunizer told me that since the first dose was so bad that this one will probably be worse and set in more rapidly.

From everything I‚Äôve been reading/and from the immunizer, if you get super sick after your first dose, you have already had Covid previously, however I never got remotely sick the prior year (so maybe I‚Äôm an asymptotic carrier). Either way I‚Äôm about 3 hours into dose 2 and feeing ok so far.

For the first shot, I just felt a little tired the first night and slight chills but really nothing I would have noticed too much if I wasn‚Äôt looking for it. Of course, my arm hurt like a son of a bitch, despite doing arm circles. I vacuumed my whole house and made sure to use the arm with the shot and that seemed to help a lot the next day. About 6 days later, I got Covid arm, which means I got a huge round welt on my arm where I got the shot. It was extremely itchy and then progressed to hot and slightly painful. I also got some redness and itching on my neck and chest, which only lasted about a day. The Covid arm itching, swelling, and heat/tenderness resolved in about a week but it stayed red for about 2 weeks. I got the second shot in my other arm per CDC guidance for those who experienced covid arm with the first shot. 

I got the second shot a couple of days ago on Friday afternoon. Friday evening I felt a bit more tired than usual and went to bed early. My arm hurt a lot, but I expected that. I woke up at 3am with chills, a high fever (104.1F), very nauseous. I threw up. Took some Tylenol and tried to sleep but couldn‚Äôt. I had a lot of pain all over. Like my skin was very sensitive to the touch and my joints all felt swollen and painful. The Tylenol reduced my fever enough for me to sleep a little. I felt a little better on Saturday morning/afternoon, but at around 5pm Saturday got a second round of fever, chills, aches. Threw up again. Fever wasn‚Äôt as high this time, 103.6F. Took ibuprofen this time as my muscles ached tremendously. Napped for about 2 hours and woke up when the fever broke. By 9pm I was feeling a lot better. I slept through Saturday night with no more fever and today, Sunday, I feel perfectly normal and fine. My arm still hurts a little but not as bad as the first shot did at the same point in time, probably because it‚Äôs in my dominant arm this time. If I‚Äôm going to get Covid arm again, I‚Äôll find out in about a week as that‚Äôs apparently how long it is until onset for those that get it.

I read some studies that reported women having a stronger immune response to the vaccine so that may explain why I had such high fevers yesterday. I‚Äôm happy it seems to have been short lived and that in about 2 weeks from now I will be able to put the fear of this pandemic behind me and start my life again!",1621834227.0,2021-05-23 22:30:27

It took about 36 hours for me to come around. When I did, I felt 100%. 

Fast forward to Round 2 this week. I get the shot at 3:45 pm on Thursday and I go home to make sure I have everything taken care of in case I get sick again. Mowed the lawn, took the garbage out, etc. Around 10 pm, I get super tired very fast. My arm was starting to get sore. At 2 am, I woke up with the chills. I didn‚Äôt sleep again until around 5 am. Mustered up enough energy to text my boss that I was out. He expected it because of how I handled the first shot and was cool about it. I checked my temp and it‚Äôs 101.5. I popped some ibuprofen, slugged as much water as I could and laid back down. I woke up around 11:30 with a headache and a 100.4 fever. I laid around until 1:30 pm and went back to bed. I slept for the next four hours. And I still woke up with a 102.2 temp. After taking more ibuprofen, I started feeling a little better but was sore and tired the rest of the evening.

Today, I was at about 75-80%. Got some stuff done but wore out quickly. I‚Äôm hoping my Sunday goes as smooth as it did following the first shot.

I got my second shot yesterday, 5/21 @ 11:30 AM, and once again, fatigue set in around 9PM. I went to bed around 11PM and woke up at 3AM to more fatigue and mild chills. I managed to fall back asleep until 8AM today and woke up feeling refreshed, minus soreness on my arm and a mildly achey body. 

I am fortunate to have had such mild reactions, although I was bracing for worse. I know our bodies react differently but I hope this helps if you're also relatively young and healthy but on the fence of getting vaccinated or fearing the 2nd shot.",1621732384.0,2021-05-22 18:13:04

Question about autoimmune diseases and mRNA vaccines,2,nictad,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nictad/question_about_autoimmune_diseases_and_mrna/,18,"Autoimmunes are my main concern with the vaccine. The mRNA enters your body's cells. Not sure what type of cells it enters, maybe all? random? only cells in your muscle at site of injection?

After entering the cell, the cell is instructed to make a spike protein on the surface of itself. That is, your body's cell now has a spike protein on it. Then, your immune system activates and attacks that cell.

Theoretically this shouldn't cause autoimmune problems. But we don't really know how the immune system learns to attack things, and how it decides something is foreign. If we did, we'd probably have cures for autoimmune diseases.

My concerns are:

* If the immune system ""eats"" one of my own cells (with spike), can it learn to attack other cells of the same type, even if they don't have the spike protein attached?
* If the cells that the mRNA enters are vital, or can't regenerate, and are then killed by my immune system, does that make my body weaker? For example, if heart muscle cells are found by the mRNA, could I develop heart disease or die of a heart attack?

So far, the mainstream view is ""no proof has emerged that mRNA vaccines cause new autoimmune diseases."" If that's true, then the only worry I have is the second one: can the mRNA enter cells it shouldn't, and if so, wouldn't it cause irreversible damage - sometimes life threatening?",1621695459.0,2021-05-22 07:57:39

I think a lot of physical problems you encounter have absolutely no relation to getting vaccinated, but are just random occurring events that can happen anytime (headache, pain, bruises, general discomfort, etc.)

Now about my vaccinations. After the first shot I experienced above average pain at the injection site and a slight headache. Pain at the injection site is good, since this indicates mild inflammation which tells me that my immune system is doing its job.
After the second shot.only very mild pain at the site of injection.

Eustachian Tube Dysfunction,18,nhlemu,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nhlemu/eustachian_tube_dysfunction/,31,"I [29F] posted here a couple of weeks ago about still feeling unwell, and I'd put off updating because I had hoped to have good news of my recovery by now. It's been one month now since my 2nd Moderna shot and I'm still dealing with dizziness and vertigo, ear pain in both ears, and slight pain behind my left eye. 

I went to the doctor on May 10th and was diagnosed with Eustachian Tube Dysfunction and given a course of Prednisone, which helped a lot but did not resolve the issue. After finishing the steroids, my ear pain got much worse so now I'm taking antibiotics for ear infection. The dizziness went away while I was on steroids but has since returned, and it feels like the tubes in my ears are full of fluid and unable to drain properly. 

I'll be on antibiotics for another 7 days and I'm hopeful that my condition will improve, but feeling unwell for a full month at this point is really disheartening. I go back to the doctor for a follow-up appointment next week. I suspect that if this round of medication doesn't resolve my issues that I'll be referred to an ENT, but I'm beginning to wonder what more can be done for me if it doesn't improve. My doctor said that because the vaccine was the only thing that was different that it's likely what triggered this issue, but that there is very little information available at this point so he's unable to tell me more than that. 

I'm mostly just posting this in case someone else has these same side effects so maybe we can compare timelines and collectively hope for improvement.

Don't panic if you're having cramps or menstrual cycle issues!,42,nh0c17,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nh0c17/dont_panic_if_youre_having_cramps_or_menstrual/,18,"First, a disclaimer: I'm not a doctor. (Nor do I play one on TV, dad jokes ftw). These are just my own observations. 

But seriously, if you're having issues or reading about post-menopausal ""starting"" their periods again, it's not as scary as it sounds, I swear - and I've been having issues.

The uterine lining is an active part of the immune system. *Apparently* when that immune system is activated by a perceived threat, the response from the endometrium is to shed. This would explain anyone having spotting or heavy bleeding when they don't expect it after being given the first or second doses of the shot. This can be an obnoxiously long process (in my case) if you're on some form of birth control that typically prevents the lining from shedding *(fun fact, periods on most kinds of BC are from hormonal shifts, NOT from the lining shedding, hence why they're far less awful once you're on contraceptives.)*

With all of that being said - and *I can. Not. Say. This. Enough.* The claim that this is a sign that the vaccine will affect your fertility is one of the stupidest things that I have ever heard. The lining sheds. It grows back. It's a natural process. If your monthly cycle doesn't affect fertility, this certainly won't! 

I'm saying this because I'm seeing a lot of people get really concerned about this, and I was, too. But once you realize that the endometrium is an active part of the immune system, it puts a lot of things into perspective.

Yes, I'm in a stupid amount of cramp pain. Yes, it sucks. But it's better than covid, so I have no regrets.

I'm an average non-smoker with no chronic health issues and I get about 3 hours of scheduled exercise each week. That said, I had a pretty rough time with the 2nd shot for a few days, and wanted to share my side effects (all of which have cleared up just fine) to help put anyone at ease who might be going through a rough time like I was. I know I felt better once I learned I wasn't the only one having a tough time with the shot.

My first shot was pretty uneventful, 48 hours of arm soreness, some mild body-wide inflammation about a week later that caused some discomfort in my abdomen and chest, and the Moderna rash on my arm. Felt fine after two weeks. Anyway.

Got #2 at 5PM on a Friday and developed mild soreness near the injection after about two hours. Felt similar to the first shot. Chugged a bunch of water, then had one drink because I felt ""totally fine"" and it was Friday (don't do that, by the way), and went to bed around 11.

I woke up around 4:30AM on Saturday because my entire body ached, and it ached *bad*. Joints, muscles, tendons, bones... everything. I shuffled out of bed and drank more water, had some oatmeal and took some acetaminophen which took the edge off a bit, but everything still hurt, particularly my head and neck. The lymph nodes around my collarbone and armpit on my injection arm were all super tender as well, but not visibly swollen.

I had some serious brain fog, and my sense of balance felt wonky. I felt like I wasn't tracking my movement that well. Imagine if someone came through and messed with the driver's-seat position on your car - it felt kind of like that. Things just felt slightly off and unfamiliar.

My skin was sensitive everywhere like I had a bad case of the flu, and the Moderna rash near the injection site popped up early Saturday. It showed up a week after my first shot, so I wasn't surprised to see it again sooner this time around since there were a lot of reports of that happening.

I drifted in and out of short bouts of sleep for most of Saturday and ended up finally watching the Haunting of Hill House (pretty good, but more drama than spookiness). At one point I got pretty warm but never noticed any sweating. By 10PM on Saturday, the side effects were starting to subside, and on Sunday all that remained of the original side effects were the sore arm, and a head/neck ache that didn't really respond to acetaminophen.

A new unexpected side effect popped up on Sunday and lasted through Monday though: a rash that covered nearly all of my back, save for the area around my neck. It had some characteristics similar to a sunburn - if anything rubbed against it, there would be a delayed and intense itch that crept up about 10 seconds later, but there was none of the accompanying pain that a sunburn brings. The delayed itch subsided after about 6 hours and was more of a novelty than a concern, but I still sent some pics and info to my dermatologist who mentioned a ton of other patients had reached out about weird side effects, and a few had shared stories similar to mine.

I slept easier on Sunday night but the arm, head, and neck pain still persisted through Monday so I took the day off.

Tuesday I was back to mostly normal, the usual pain sites were lessening and most of the brain fog had cleared up. Another fun side effect showed up briefly: a scar I had from a blood drive over a year ago suddenly flared up and started itching for a few hours. I ended up taking some allergy meds and dumped some calamine on it and that did the trick.

By Wednesday, everything seemed pretty normal and by Thursday the arm pain was completely gone. Nerve-wise, I recall a few random muscle spasms here and there, and a handful of extremely brief chest pains at different pinpoint locations on my left side throughout the recovery process, but nothing permanent.

My wife had her second shot a week before mine and had a pretty easy time with the side effects. Same story for nearly all of my other friends (save for one guy who had a pretty rough time too), so my experience was definitely an outlier. Just be aware that every body is different, so try to give yourself time to recover.

Self Care Tips:

     ‚Ä¢ Water is your best friend. I drank about 1.5 gallons of water the day of my shot and about a gallon the next day, plus some pedialite, and I still feel a little dehydrated. Water needs are different for everyone, so just pay attention to how you feel.

I had huge anxiety before my appointment and during, so despite my best efforts to make my arm a limp noodle, I tensed up a bit and felt the vaccine prick. It was over in 0.5 seconds and I immediately said wow, that wasn't so bad! I did get dizzy a few seconds after and have to lay down and have a juice box, but it wasn't too bad. 

Day of shot - Slight stinging where I got the shot for maybe 30 mins after. Arm soreness started fairly early, and then I had about 3 long naps through out the day because I felt SUPER sleepy. This may not actually be a vaccine side effect, it could've just been emotional exhaustion and relief from the pre-shot anxiety. I felt warm a few times but took my temperature and never actually had a fever. 

Day 2 - Arm soreness and tiredness were my only noticeable symptoms. Used an ice pack on my arm and took it easy for the day, but tried to keep my arm moving. 

Day 3 - Arm soreness became less. No other symproms. 

Day 4 - Only noticing arm soreness if I move the muscle a lot. 

Day 5 - No more pain!

i have strange skin allergy problems, am immunosuppressed, (used to get pneumonia once a year in high school) and i have a weird unexplained mass in my left arm that i haven't gotten checked out yet! (i'm really broke and have no insurance)

i also have extreme fear of vaccinations because of my dad being anti-vax for half of my life. (he got the pfizer vaccine, though! yay!)

before i could start school, i had to get all of my childhood vaccines from 3-13 in rapid succession. we're talking 5 shots a day sometimes, inevitably leading to a deep fear of needles, vaccines, etc. despite definitely not being an anti-vaxxer myself.

so with all of that said, i have a lot of fear around getting my shot. i scheduled it today and chickened out at the literal last minute. i rescheduled it, but i'm still hesitant. i know i have allergy problems and immune system issues, so should i try to save enough money to go to the doctor for a check-up before i go through with the first dose? and if not, should i expect worse side effects?

(30F) I had a fever of 103.6 after second dose. Is this normal???,5,ngmsph,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/ngmsph/30f_i_had_a_fever_of_1036_after_second_dose_is/,5,"Let me preface - I have no medical conditions that I'm aware of. I'm relatively healthy.

After my first dose I had a severe migraine. No problem, everyone said it would be either the first or second that you'd get some symptoms, if you get any at all. 

My girlfriend, who has a serious heart condition and is in good shape received Pfizer and had no symptoms with either dose. Her sister had Moderna and also had no side effects.

I got my second shot 4 days ago. Afterwards I felt fine, no issues. The shot itself was painful - and I discovered later when I went to take the band-aid off, that my shot was given high up. Like, above the muscle and into the socket/joint area. Ouch, okay.

That night, hell broke loose in my body. Very, very abruptly I started shivering like crazy, like the violent jerking. I knew I probably had a small fever because I could 'feel' it. I went to bed, and the next morning it was worse. 

I was rapidly growing weak and shaky. My girlfriend was at work and I was texting her and updating her frequently. I was so cold. By noon my temp reached 101. I was getting weaker and weaker and my whole shoulder was swollen like a solid mass and twice it's normal size.

By 3pm, my temp reached 103.6 and I was - I think - getting kind of delirious. My speech pattern sounded slow and I was having a hard time connecting my thoughts. I couldn't stand and I couldn't walk. My legs were jello. My girlfriend rushed home and literally had to help me walk to the bathroom so I could pee. My clothes were soaked through and stuck to me from sweat. I haven't had a fever that bad since I was a kid. (I had scarlet fever when I was 7, does that count as a serious medical condition?)

She had to cover me with ice packs, cold wash cloths, and hold a fan to me. It felt like torture but she was comforting me and I knew that this had to be done. After over an hour of this and Advil, my temp was under control at 99.8. it stayed under 100 all night into the next day.

4 days after the vaccine and I'm having a chronic (what feels like) tension headache. The swelling and pain moved from my socket/joint area to my back shoulder blade and up into my neck. 

Is this - all of this... Normal??? Do you guys think it's a side effect of improper injection?? Am I just really that unlucky and I'm getting hit hard for no reason??

ALSO: I do not have health insurance. So, yeah. I can't really afford to go to the doctor or hospital unless I'm literally dying. If we didn't get my fever under control, yes, I would have gone to the hospital.

ALSO ALSO: I'm all for vaccines. I'm just scared because literally no one I know had reacted this badly. Just me. That's scary. 






TLDR; Got vaccinated and had severe reactions including high fever and my shoulder swelling to twice it's natural size. Dude giving me the vaccine injected it into my socker/joint area and not the muscle. Is it all normal y/n?",1621502163.0,2021-05-20 02:16:03

Part of me thinks that it is because I‚Äôve had no appetite today, which normally I am eating a lot before my period because I crave different foods and generally just have a bigger appetite. 

Anyone else experience this potential side effect? Thanks!",1621409662.0,2021-05-19 00:34:22

* Hypothyroidism (controlled)

* Uveitis, Episcleritis, Scleritis (remission)

* Interstitial cystitis (controlled)

* Asthma (controlled)

* Mild rosacea

First, I'd like to say how happy I am that I've been vaccinated and that I'd take my minor side effects any day over COVID.  But...

I had quite a few non-serious symptoms after my second shot on 5/5, but I had a telehealth appointment this morning for full body itching.  This stuff began a day or two after the shot.  It seemed like Benadryl was becoming less effective over the weekend and I've been a walking zombie when I am awake due to the sedative effect.  I also developed a yeast infection during the first week - yay :(.

My NP told me to switch to zyrtec or allegra (chose zyrtec) and prescribed prednisone and fluconazole.

Has anyone else had random itching all over since the vaccine?  How long did it take to resolve?  My outdoor furniture irritated my skin so badly this weekend that I had to come inside.. my sofa feels awful against my skin.  My scalp, nose, ears, arms, legs.. you name it... have been itching.  I had to braid and tie my hair up in a bun to get it off my neck and back.. which is the only place where I have a few small irritated spots.  (In the same area I had badchicken pox symptoms 34 years ago!)

Have any of you taking prednisone 10+ days after the second dose?  I forgot to ask about vaccine efficacy and now it's worrying me.

Update 5/20/21:
Had exacerbation of pain during the night and early morning hours.  I was able to get a quick appointment with my NP who told me it looks like I have shingles.  She took a swab for a culture and prescribed valacyclovir, along with pain medication and anti nausea meds.  NP advised me to send a vaers report and told me this kind of thing was important to report because it's underreported.  Sent the report.

Initial itching had slowed dramatically since taking the steroid.  NP says that the full body itching was not related to the shingles.  I guess I just got super lucky !",1621342750.0,2021-05-18 05:59:10

My second shot started hurting more quickly than my first and it was getting worse over the next 2-3 hours, so I thought I was due for a horrible night. The arm pain lingered a bit and was especially sore that night but that seemed to be the only major reaction I had. And even that wasn‚Äôt quite as bad as the first time. I had no fever, no nausea, a brief headache that night (7-8 hours later, lasted a few hours), and a mild but noticeable fatigue (only the first 12 hours). 24 hours later I was practically full strength. I definitely feel lucky. 
Only reflection I have that I‚Äôd offer: I made it a mission to drink a highly above average amount of water starting that morning (appointment as 7pm) and probably could have started earlier. It‚Äôs my best guess on why I felt fine and it definitely couldn‚Äôt have hurt.

Symptoms 2.5 weeks after first dose?,6,necdmp,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/necdmp/symptoms_25_weeks_after_first_dose/,12,"Hi everyone. I received my first dose of moderna vaccine on April 27th. I didn't get any symptoms aside from sore arm and feeling tired. I chalked off being tired with just my trouble sleeping in general so I'm not sure if that were the side effect.

It's about two weeks and a half since the first dose (it's now May 17th) and I felt a lump below my ear and jawline by my neck. I panicked and first guess was I suddenly grew a tumor and that I'm going to die of cancer. So I started googling a bunch, and found out it could just be a swollen cervical lymph node which is a completely common side effect of the moderna/pfizer vaccine. I've never had a swollen lymph node before. According to the news... it mostly occur among 16% of women after the vaccine. Something about how 1 in every 10 people (or just women?) gets a swollen lymph node after the vaccine either on their collarbone, breast area, by their neck, or underneath their armpit usually on the same side they received their vaccine in. Said it was going to last for about 1-2 weeks to 1-2 months. Also that because a lot of women has been going to the doctors after their vaccine due to a swollen lymph node that there were a lot of false positives on the mammogram for cancer. I'm telling you guys this to help comfort whoever that might be in the same situation as I am. 

My problem is that most people received their symptoms within the first two days of their vaccine, or even within the first week. But I didn't get my symptoms until 2.5 weeks after which makes me think maybe it's NOT from the vaccine and Im just getting a common cold? 

I was feeling tired most of the time during the second week, trouble sleeping, and what feels like allergies. I am super vigilant about wearing a mask all the time while I was out, washing my hands often, and using hand sanitizer whenever I get back into the car again. I'm almost always home and barely go out to socialize since I dont have much friends here in california, they are all back in NYC.  As I'm typing this, I'm feeling slightly warm, eyes feel tired and sleepy, and the swollen lymph node on my neck is sore. I plan to monitor my symptoms and keeping watch of my swollen lymph node to make sure it doesn't get any bigger before going to the doctors. 

I just want to know if any of you also received WAY delayed symptoms, im talking 2+ week after your first dose. I might just need some more words of comfort to calm my anxiety. Thank you.",1621275267.0,2021-05-17 11:14:27

\-first shot no problems besides some slight arm pain

\-second shot completely fucked me up

I got the second shot of Moderna around 9 am yesterday.  I felt completely fine until around 12 pm where I began experiencing mild arm pain. No worse than the first time around.  Then later in the day around 8:30 pm, I began to feel the onset of a very bad cold. Chills, fever, body aches, fatigue, and an inability to sleep. Finally, around 9:30 or so I fell asleep only to wake around midnight feeling like absolute death with a strong needing to pee sensation. so I walked to the bathroom to pee and upon finishing I took no more than two steps out of the bathroom and collapsed onto the floor. My vision went blurry and dark, my body had lost all its strength, and was tingling all over. In addition to that, I was experiencing a severe hot flash to the point where my body felt like it had caught on fire. and on top of that, I and I was experiencing severe nausea.  I laid on the floor for several minutes unable to move until my body regained enough strength to crawl to the sink where I drank and threw some water on myself to cool down. I then laid on the floor for another several minutes until my vision and body came had gained enough strength to return to my bed. the rest of that night I got maybe 3 hours of sleep tops, all while feeling like absolute shit. 

  
As for today, I began to feel somewhat better. Just some mild body aches, slight on and off fever, and a mild throbbing headache.  I'm hoping by tomorrow I will be fully recovered and it seems like that will be the case judging by how I'm feeling now. But my question is why did I legit pass out and should I be worried about it?

I am an eighteen-year-old girl who weighs 98 pounds, is on yaz birth control, and has hashimotos hypothyroidism. I received the second Moderna vaccine this past Friday at 10 am. Only side I experienced from 10 am to about 7 pm was a little brain fog. At around 7pm, I experienced a horrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, bad body aches, and just general discomfort. Thankfully that discomfort dissipated the following morning, but I still had lingering fatigue yesterday; this morning I woke up and felt like I had returned to my normal self again. 

*For reference I am a dedicated cross country runner that trains 6-7 days and runs sub 20 minute 5k‚Äôs* Anticipating being ill from the second vaccine, I ran an easy 14:02 recovery run Friday morning at 7:30 am. I decided to take yesterday off to allow my body to fully recover. Since I felt normal today, I intended on running a 6 mile tempo run at a 6:45 pace. However, 2.08 into my run, my heart felt like it was legitimately going to burst. I was experiencing horrible palpitations. I took a 10 minute break and tried to run an easy cool down, but two minutes into my cool down my heart rate rapidly increased yet again.

ORIGINAL POST:
A right-wing extremist on my Facebook timeline just posted a short video of someone looking up the components of the Moderna vaccine and claiming that a component of the vaccine called SM-102 was unsafe and unfit for use on humans. The link he pulled up to make his claim is posted below (you have to click on ""download Safety Data Sheet"" in order to see the information he was pointing out.

Can someone give me more information on SM-102?

47F, reasonably healthy but probably should lose 10 lbs, semi-regular low key exercise, no dietary restrictions, seasonal allergies (yay, pollen!), take multi vitamin daily, and usually no effects from getting annual flu shots.  Ate and hydrated normally before both shots.  Resumed my allergy medication two days after both doses.

1st dose Moderna

* in afternoon
* Didn't feel the needle, not even any bleeding.
* Morning after

1. slight soreness at injection site,
2. headache that didn't go away with hydration, food and coffee.  200mg ibuprofen took care of it.

2nd dose 30 days later

* in a.m.
* Injection was more painful and bled this time.  Arm got sore, but nothing bad.  I did arm exercises during my post-shot 15 minute wait and periodically during the day based on some recommendations here.   Soreness completely gone 3rd day after injection.
* Day went normally, but I felt slightly tired by dinner so decided to go to sleep early.
* Woke up with headache.  Food, coffee, hydration didn't help so took 200 mg ibuprofen. Poof, headache gone and didn't come back.

&#x200B;

That's it.  Just the residual sore arm for another 24-48 hrs.

After you have tried prednisone (which I do recommend a brief try), then ask your doctor about trying Acetazolamide. I used to hear it everywhere doing pretty much anything a little over a week ago.

Acetazolamide has its own side effects, I won't pretend to claim it doesn't. However, I will deal with it so long as it takes down the tinnitus. Hopefully, when I get 'pure' silence I can drop the medication too.

Good luck, I have had tinnitus for 3 months and two weeks. I hope you can find relief sooner!

After the 4 days the pain went away but as the days went on I would get this stabbing sensation on my arm right where I got the vaccine. This stabbing sensation would turn into a very painful stingy sensation but it would usually go away during the day, but now since last Sunday my arm won't stop hurting at all and yesterday it started getting numb to the point where it hurts so much when I lift my arm.

I was not surprised as I run a fever normally so I thought a slight spike could be as bad as it got, ha! Within 3 hours of checking my temp it got up to 104.9¬∞F. My mom panicked and had me take all the precautions to prevent any permanent damage from the fever. It took 12 hours for the body aches to go away.

Really weird effects after 1st shot.. I'm really scared to take 2nd shot of Moderna,12,nbypkh,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nbypkh/really_weird_effects_after_1st_shot_im_really/,7,"Hi, I'm 33M, mostly healthy except for asthma and about 2 years ago I was diagnosed with very mild fatty liver (so I quit drinking, I've been sober for 1.5 years now.) So having asthma has made this a pretty scary pandemic for me. I was so excited about these vaccines, I was crying with happiness when I got the 1st shot. I can see people I love again. I can get back to work!!! I can get back to my life!! I had no side effects at all the 1st day.

But 2 days after the 1st vaccine, I started feeling side effects. I felt the obvious ones like fever and headache and chills, which I completely expected and didn't scare me. But my face was also going numb. ""That's.. kind of weird.."" I thought. I went in to panic mode and we called both Moderna and the Pharmacist and they asked if it was affecting my breathing or swallowing, and no it wasn't. They said to keep an eye on it and call 911 if I have difficulty breathing, but otherwise it should be okay. But my lips and tongue were numb/tingling, and parts of my forehead and nose. I couldn't sleep very well at first. I kept having sleep apnea like symptoms, where I would wake up every 5 minutes gasping. I have never had sleep apnea in my entire life. (Or any of these other symptoms.)

So, I finally got to sleep with the help of my girl calling me on the phone and going to sleep with me that way. The next day.. the regular side effects went away. But my face feels like it's on fire. Like a rash or eczema or poison ivy on my face, especially under my beard and hair. My eyes were bloodshot, and I felt pressure on my head and face, especially in my eyes and forehead. And my face was still burning. I could physically see a rash all over my face and there were bags under my eyes.

I started looking up histamine intolerance and food that would help with that, and I started changing my diet. Nothing helped. Dairy products like Yogurt especially would cause my face to feel like someone was taking a flamethrower to it. Then I started reading about mold exposure symptoms. There was reason to believe there could be mold in that room, so I got out of that room and we got a mold inspection (not cheap, but health is more important than money) and thank God there was no visual mold found and two room spore samples in laboratory came back fine, our house is clean. That's good news, but by now I've been practically starving myself in panic fear of mold poisoning and this terrible feeling in my body. I felt so much brain fog, it was as if I was on a low dose of Valium 24/7. With my face burning on fire and lightheadedness. I was nearly hallucinating from lack of sleep because I would ""shock"" awake every 5 minutes and couldn't sleep. Thank GOD that has (mostly) gone away, and if I'm really tired, I am getting 8+ hours of sleep a night now.

About 3-4 weeks after the 1st shot, some of these symptoms have become a lot more mild or gone away most of the day. I'm still lightheaded at times, or I feel like there's a ""rubber band"" around my head. I feel an occasional tingling or burning on my face, mouth, or lips, but it's much less intense than originally.

So after a few weeks of slowly re-intruducing foods (I still can't seem to tolerate milk, even though I have NEVER been lactose intolerant in my entire life. I tried having Yogurt and suddenly the burning face symptoms came right back as if it was day 1 of these feelings again, same with the BoltHouse chocolate protein shake that I used to drink all the time for years with my exercise regimen) I feel about 60-80% better depending on the day. But my blood pressure has been pretty consistently low.

Average Blood Pressure since the vaccine has been 107/65 - Pulse: 69. I was 142 pounds or so before the shot, and now I'm about 125 (which I account for basically starving myself during that food and mold panic. I've been eating a lot more calories now and am slowly gaining my weight back.) The lowest I've measured Blood Pressure was 88/56 - Pulse: 68 which scared the crap out of me. I have occasionally seen it higher at 119/75 - Pulse: 72 which is a lot more normal, but the average is in the low 100's and 60s. I'm not dizzy or anything, but I feel that ""pressure"" around my head all day sometimes.

I've talked to multiple doctors, and none of them are really giving me a clear answer. One told me that it was good I'm not experiencing headaches or nausua and stuff and that it didn't effect my breathing at all, and she wants me to make sure I'm getting proper nutrients such as B12, Vitamin K, Iron, Zinc, Calcium etc. each day and put me on B12 Supplements, 1,000 MG. The problem is, I feel MUCH worse lightheaded wise anytime I take the B12 (I know B12 is very safe as far as toxicity, but it's a terrible feeling.) I'm not sure if there's a correlation or just a coincidence.

My other doctor I saw in person said my Blood Pressure was ""a little"" low, but she didn't know my base-line before the vaccine so she didn't have anything to compare it to. It was also a tiny bit higher at the doctor office, so maybe I'm not doing it right at home for testing, (at the doctors office it was only in the 60s on the second number once out of all the tests.) She told me to not rule out the 2nd vaccine just yet, but prescribed me steroids that I am absolutely terrified to take. I don't know what to do. I want to be free and get BACK to my LIFE. But I've been feeling these weird feelings for like a MONTH+ since the 1st vaccine and I'm terrified to take the 2nd one. Now the burning face and numbness/tingling is \*mostly\* gone now, but the weird head sensations, low blood pressure, etc. still linger. And I tried lifting weights one time (not super heavy like I was before the vaccine) and I felt HORRIBLE all night long.

Can anybody relate to this? Does anybody have any insight? I'm so miserable. I'm so tired of this pandemic. I'm so tired of feeling like this FROM THE VACCINE (unless it's not even FROM the vaccine. Am I diabetic all of the sudden? And it just HAPPENS to show symptoms the EXACT SECOND I get the other side effects?) I'm so lost, and doctors aren't really giving me a clear answer. ""It should go away on its own"" one of them told me, 3 weeks after the shot. This is so terrible feeling and scary. Thank you so much for any replies.",1620989744.0,2021-05-14 03:55:44

For reference, I'm a healthy 38-year-old male with exercise-induced asthma.

# My First Dose

I did the windmill technique but still ended up with some fairly significant arm pain, which started  4 hours post-shot and lasted a few days. My body felt a little weird. A sensitive skin feeling. Or an uncomfortable sort of body high? I developed a dry cough that lasted the better part of a week. None of this was very bad. Mostly an unremarkable experience.

# My Second Dose

I was experiencing brain fog and some mild dizzy spells for a few days prior to getting my second shot. It sucked, and was probably unrelated to the vaccine. For all I know, it could have been the COVID itself, and the initial vaccine is what saved my life. In any case, I went ahead with my second dose, nicely hydrated and stocked with food/supplies. Surprisingly, the arm pain was not at all bad this time. About 9 hours or so after getting the shot, I started getting that body high feeling again. My body couldn't regulate its temperature. I was watching TV in the bed and had to keep covering up and uncovering, felt like I had a sheen of sweat on me. Not bad at all. I shut off the lights and tried to sleep, assuming I'd wake up in the middle of the night feeling like death. It never came. I rolled around having sweaty fever dreams pretty much the same way I would have after pounding drinks or doing drugs at a party or both. You know. Some stupid song on loop in your head. Thoughts not making much sense. By morning I had a headache. It felt exactly as if I'd gotten drunk and involved in a bar fight (some body aches). I took four ibuprofen, which fixed me up. I felt so good I decided to drive an hour to a greenhouse and buy plants, which in retrospect was a mistake, because it kinda drained me and made me feel fatigued. It's better to take it easy folks. Again, I developed a dry cough which I still have six days later. It'll go away at some point.

Anyway, I'm 100% fine. Yeah it's a weird vaccine and it makes you feel weird for a bit. I personally know at least a dozen people who have taken Moderna, of all ages, and it only knocked one of them on their ass and she was also on chemotherapy.

I know this is the Moderna subreddit but the Pfizer one seemed inactive so I'm asking here. I am a 19 year old male who got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine almost three weeks ago. In fact, my second shot is tomorrow.

Everything was fine up until around two days ago, when I started feeling stiffness in my lower back. That stiffness has almost radiated upwards and now my entire lower back feels stiff. When I am idle, there is no pain or sensation, but as soon as I stretch it I feel the stiffness. In addition, the muscles under my left arm are now a bit sorer (I got my shot in this arm). I was also feeling a bit of pain down my right leg. Am I paranoid about this potentially being Guillain Barre Syndrome or another nerve disorder? Even though its been a long time since my 1st dose, these conditions can take weeks to manifest.

Like some of you, I was very scared about this. 

First dose was fine, I had a sore arm and my period was 10 days late (I wonder if pregnancy test sales have gone up at all this time). 

Tuesday I hydrated as much as I could. I actually made a water drinking game with Shaun of the Dead. Everytime they say ""you've got red on you"" take a sip of water, etc. Made it fun :) 

2nd shot was Wednesday at 8 AM. Nurse massaged my arm after injecting me; I'm sure that helped!. No problems until about 4 PM, I was feeling like I was starting to get a cold. I took a Tylenol and napped for 15 minutes. I woke up and felt much better!

Around 8 PM I spiked a 101 fever. I normally run at 97.6. I had the chills, and was feeling a little nauseous. Took another Tylenol, and two Dramamine. Had a few crackers to keep my stomach acid from bothering me. I couldn't get comfy until about an hour ago. I took a 15 minute nap, and bam, fever was down to 99.9! Still have a headache, and my arm hurts but the worst is over :)

Sip some water, have a Gatorade, keep some crackers nearby. I haven't seen my parents for over a year and a half, and now that I have my second vaccine, they're coming up to see me. 

I know it's scary, but oh man I can't wait to hug my mom. 

It's going to be ok! Talking to my friends about Random things helped distract me. If any of you need someone to talk to to distract yourselves, feel free to message me. 

See y'all on the other side :)


Edit: I fell asleep around 4 am woke up at 8. Stood up to go to the restroom, and everything hurt. I ended up sleeping most of the day. Woke up and took tylenol every four hours or so. I had no appetite, and my arm hurt. Fell asleep for good around 10 PM. 

Day two after the second dose. Woke up with absolutely no arm pain, no headache, nothing. Also woke up to my period starting a week early. Argh. So I'm just fine, did some gardening, the usual normal life.",1620912092.0,2021-05-13 06:21:32
Vaccine 2nd Dose Dilemma,1,nbr7dj,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nbr7dj/vaccine_2nd_dose_dilemma/,3,"Hi all. I am 22F, got my first dose of Moderna on March 31st. Was so pumped to finally be able to feel a little more secure and safe!

For the following 4 1/2 weeks I suffered from strange body pains. They originated on the side of my body that got the shot, and were like sharp muscle pains that came on FAST. Sometimes this made it hard for me to use my arm/leg. At one point, pain in my leg was so bad that I assumed it was a blood clot, but luckily it wasn‚Äôt. The pains then began affecting both sides of my body, making me feel fatigued and making some movements difficult. 

I obviously contacted my PCP about this and she linked me up with a neurologist (seeing neurologist next week). When I contacted my PCP, she advised that I cancel my second shot, since it was presumed that the first one caused this nerve pain/inflammation flare up. I cancelled my shot appt. I was DEVASTATED. I want nothing more than to be fully vaccinated, but i‚Äôd like to know what‚Äôs happening in my body first. So frustrating. anyways. 

Now, i‚Äôve been a week without consistent nerve pain‚ÄîI actually feel pretty good and normal and haven‚Äôt noticed any body pains. I‚Äôm outside of the 42 day window that you can receive the 2nd dose within, (i‚Äôm 43 days out from first dose), but I was wondering if I could still get the 2nd vaccine and if the pros of being protected outweigh the con of possible nerve problems. 

Mostly looking for feedback on what others think. Thanks for reading.",1620968147.0,2021-05-13 21:55:47
Covid Arm (from Pfizer) Anyone?,0,nbqf6n,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nbqf6n/covid_arm_from_pfizer_anyone/,10,"I tried to post to the Pfizer sub, but one must wait for approval in that Sub.  

The crux; I had Covid Arm on dominant arm, small Quarter $0.25 sized spot at injection spot, which was red, then scaly, then slight bruise, now healed (healed fully at injection spot).  The weird part for me was my dominant arm's palm (again, same arm as injection).  Later that night after my first Pfizer dose, I went home and excercised pretty hard (including using dumbbells/weights, which I hadn't done too often in recent months).  Originally I chalked my hand up to simply being soft, but it was the exact same red/scaly/itchy as the small spot where vaccine was injected.  My palm showed reaction the next day, but became more agitated (now is almost completely healed, 28 days later).  

First question:  has anyone had any Covid-Arm reaction on their hands/palms? (I had no reaction to my other hand, only hand of injection arm.)

Second question: has anyone had Covid-Arm from Pfizer?  (sorry, I know this is Moderna Sub)

Im scheduled for 2nd dose today, and Im a little spooked (but Im going to go for it).  Thanks in advance for any feedback!",1620966110.0,2021-05-13 21:21:50
"19f, second dose experience",2,nbhlab,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/nbhlab/19f_second_dose_experience/,0,"I had minimal symptoms with my first dose, only pain and swelling at the injection site! 

Unfortunately, things escalated with the second dose. I received it on Tuesday at 1pm. I think my symptoms set in a little earlier than most people, at around 7-9 hours after I received it. At 8pm I was feeling rather lethargic but I didn't go to bed so I could play games with some friends online. I had to get off pretty early though, because by around 10pm I was experiencing chills and nausea. My skin gets very sensitive when I have a fever so my clothing rubbing against me was also making me uncomfortable/in pain.

I settled into bed at around 11pm, but I was so cold and nauseous that I was tossing and turning until about midnight. At almost exactly midnight, I had to suddenly vomit. This was the only time I was physically ill and I was able to fall asleep after this.

When I woke up the next morning (6am), I was still not feeling well and I now had strong muscle aches. I was able to take my temperature at this point and it was 100f, though I assume it was higher the previous night because my chills had subsided by morning. My mom and I took tylenol at about 8am and I immediately felt MUCH better. Nearly all my symptoms went away until 2pm, when they began to return as I was sitting in class. I ended up leaving class early and taking another tylenol dose, which helped once again. By evening, I was feeling much better and did not have to take tylenol to fall asleep. The only symptom I had at that point was remaining nausea.

Waking up this morning, my nausea is mostly gone. I stood up from bed and was a little lightheaded, but after eating breakfast today that went away pretty quickly. I assume that not eating enough took a bit of a toll, since I've always felt lightheaded while fasting. My appetite is still working itself out but I no longer am worried I'll throw up if I eat a meal. My arm pain has faded but I woke up with armpit pain, strangely enough. I've figured that this is a swollen lymph node so I'm not too worried, but it was unexpected.

Heres to feeling even better tomorrow!",1620944024.0,2021-05-13 15:13:44

I'm pretty happy overall that i got the appointment and that i can do my part in hopefully ending this pandemic soon, or at the minimum protect others and myself from this horrible virus.  


That being said, seeing as i am also a migraine sufferer and occasionally get really painful and horrible migraines with aura (basically losing part of my vision, unable to think clearly, kinda like a mini stroke), i'm pretty much ok with most possible side-effects except for the vaccine possibly triggering a migraine attack, which i am very much afraid of, considering how horrible it always feels.  


I was hoping that maybe someone could help me ease the anxiety a little, since i'm not sure how widespread it actually is for people my age to get a lot of side-effects and or something like migraines.  


I would also like to mention that i do have a prescription for triptanes, so in an emergency those would help but i'm more concerned that they might also not work or that i'll get like a continuoeus migraine or something like that, which would be an absolute nightmare for me.  


My Grandma (aged 70) got vaccinated a month ago and didn't really have any side-effect after her first dose at least, so i'm hopeful that maybe it won't be too bad.  


Anyway, thank you so much in advance, and i hope i don't sound like i'm afraid of like everything \^\^''",1620963308.0,2021-05-13 20:35:08

Wednesday i began feeling flu like symptoms including aches and chills. Minor headache. Went home after work to take it easy and nap. Symptoms were gone And i was back to 80% by late that evening.

The good news is, it was actually great! My arm was moderately sore for the weekend and I was slightly more tired than normal - but that's it!

I just got home. I got a metallic taste in my mouth immediately as she was giving me the shot, which happened last time as well, but it was stronger this time around.

I have been reading that some people have experienced issues related to their menstrual cycle after the vaccine. I‚Äôm 41F, I dont use any birth control.

It didn‚Äôt look anything like menstrual blood, it was bright red, like a nosebleed. I am due to start my next period on the 18th, and already my PMS has been so much more horrible than it normally is. I am so bloated and tired, and my boobs ache like crazy. Also very bummed out and depressed. Crampy too, which is early for me.

I just wanted to see if anybody else has experienced anything similar, or any disruptions to their cycle. I went to the doctor and got checked out, they really didn‚Äôt have any explanation for me for what happened.

Update: took some pepto and it helped with the nausea almost instantly. I thought you only could take it when your stomach hurt, but it ended up helping a lot.  

Update: I don‚Äôt have any gatorlyte but I do have a magnesium drink mix. Didn‚Äôt realize magnesium was actually an electrolyte. The more you know.

Update: had a real hard time sleeping as my stomach was upset. Took my temperature and it climbed up to 100.4. Took tylenol afterword so hopefully it helps.

I am actually glad I found this group because as of late I have been having an inferiority complex in regards to this whole vaccination process. I guess I am looking to connect with others and learn from their experiences and share in everyone's safety.

After the OCD of waiting for the general public to be allowed for vaccinations in my state of Massachusetts (which was April 19th) and registering early with the state (as I am sure many others everywhere) I had trouble even finding an appointment and couldn't get one (annoying). If it wasn't for my health care provider (thank you to them!), I would have had to wait even longer for an appointment than the one I got last Thursday (at 9:30am) for dose 1 of Moderna, granted walk-ins then started..

I guess I am feeling so out of touch with everybody I know. Everyone I know has already been fully vaccinated for weeks if not months now, and everyone but two other people I know have gotten Pfizer (which is odd because Moderna is Massachusetts based). It's given me this stupid inferiority complex that I can't seem to shake. Having to wait another month for dose 2 of Moderna feels like it is never going to come (I was so hoping for Pfizer originally just because of the quicker time period between dose 1 and 2) but am appreciating that Moderna is a great vaccine.

Side note, the only symptom I had for dose 1 is a slightly sore arm when I woke up Friday morning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I guess the things I'm wondering about are:

\- How long after you were able to get vaccinated did you get an appointment?

\- How did you stay positive during the waiting period? I'm having a tough time with this..

\- Did you care if you got Moderna, Pfizer or J&J or any of the others?

22F - 1st Moderna Vacc. story time (SENSITIVE PERSON),38,n95y02,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n95y02/22f_1st_moderna_vacc_story_time_sensitive_person/,7,"Hey guys, 

So I'm going to start this off by saying that I have a lot of allergies. I'm allergic to seafood, grass, sunlight (I get hives within the first 10 minutes of being out without any kind of protection), and I have had severe allergic reactions to tetanus and flu vaccines (nearly died with both of them) in the past. Because of this, I haven't had a flu shot since I was 12. I got COVID in late March/early April last year from a university field trip, and I never wanted to have that experience again--because it was the worst sickness of my damn life. Ended up with extended exhaustion and lung problems (developed adhesions/scar tissue on the lining of my lungs after).

Also, I'm in a house filled with either anti-vaxxers or conspiracy believers, all of whom never caught COVID from me because I locked myself in my room for weeks so I wouldn't get them sick. So that's fun.

I got my first vaccine on Thursday around 9am, and I was very hesitant because I was afraid I would have an allergic reaction because my body basically hates everything. I read a lot of stories on here and it gave me the courage to just go for it and see what happens (it's better than the alternative), and I have to say that I was surprised.

All I ended up getting was a sore arm and fatigue. No fever, no body aches, chills, nausea, etc. This is simply showing that a lot of people react very differently. When I got my shot, I aimed to continue my day as normal and be as active as I usually was, which probably helped in the long run. Some people might have no reactions; some people might have reactions like mine; some might have severe reactions (like I did with other vaccines that are proven safe for the general population/FDA approved). The body is a magnificent thing and all you can do is try and protect it from all the bad in the world. Do your research, follow the science, ignore the conspiracies and do what you think is right (vaxx or no vaxx).

1st shot at 11:00 AM EST. Needle felt like a pinch but went in like a breeze no problem. Stayed 15 mins to monitor symptoms, only had a slight arm pain at injection sight but no further issues. Next appointment is June 7th.

Time now is 3:32 PM, arm pain at injection sight is a little stronger but nothing unbearable, felt like birthday punches as another redditor said but nothing truly uncomfortable. Feel fine otherwise, kinda tired but I assume that‚Äôs because I woke up early today. I will post more updates as time goes on. Making sure to drink an absurd amount of water as the day goes on.

"Questions about immunity, concerns about spike protein from conspiracy theory sites, and why I might get the mRNA shot anyway.",0,n9qgj2,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n9qgj2/questions_about_immunity_concerns_about_spike/,18,"I'm as skeptical as anybody. I even entertained the flat earth theory for a while (until I found out about [Foucault's Pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se84vG6bzoA) \- science is awesome!). This is why I like to read alternative media, which sometimes includes conspiracy theories. Normally I can argue against a conspiracy theory (although I do still believe in some whacky things especially about JFK), however the case against the vaccines is a tough nut for me to crack, as we just don't know enough about any possible long term effects yet. **However I might still get the mRNA shot.**

First I'll ask you to bear with me. I'd like to present the conspiracy theorists' general views, which have caused enough concern in me to avoid getting vaccinated (so far). I'm also very hesitant to take a risk with my health. However, the more I learn about how the mRNA vaccines work, the less concern I feel. And by this time, the first large scale tests on the global population have had several months to show longer term side effects. Thankfully, those seem to be rare.

The main ""conspiracy"" types are saying things like

* Fauci predicted the pandemic on video, a surprise outbreak during Trump's presidency - **This could just be an easy prediction to make. After all, climate change seems to be increasing the number of viral infections we've seen lately. It doesn't mean Fauci planned the pandemic.**
* [Gates wants to depopulate (quoted on youtube in a TED talk about climate change 11 years ago, and he specifically mentions vaccines to reduce the peak human population)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaF-fq2Zn7I&t=4m32s) \- **not sure what to make of this.** I don't trust Gates. In the same talk he also mentions air travel as something where carbon emissions can't be improved very much. So the pandemic could have at least two major positive effects for climate change: reduce the population (through deaths and possibly through vaccines?!?!) and reduce emissions from air travel (because people aren't allowed to travel so much). **If I give Gates the benefit of the doubt,** in the vaccine statement he says ""vaccines, healthcare, and reproductive health services"". He's saying that if we improve healthcare in poorer countries, they will stop having 8 children per family, because they will start to believe that all of their children will survive. **In that case, GOOD VACCINES, not bad ones, would reduce the global population.** And here, Gates says by about 10-15%. From 6.8b to 9b people is 2.2b, so 10% would be only about 220m. I'm pretty sure there have been more people than 220m taking the vaccines so far. **So I'm willing to pretend Gates is a good person if it means I'm likelier to get the shot.**
* (they say): ""the antibodies for the vaccine's spike protein will negatively react with the covid virus and kill everyone who takes the mRNA vaccine - just like all the ferrets did in an experiment years ago"" - from a US congressman. **My solution - by now, many people have been vaccinated and at least some of them have probably caught covid on top of their vaccine, yet we don't hear about people dropping dead from that combination, as this ""theory"" would imply.**
* some politicans have been seen without a mask on, on a personal video. They put on the mask, then they walk into the mainstream media's camera view to stand at a podium, and then take the mask off again. This implies that they don't want to wear the mask, and they put it on just for show. Then, if they don't want to wear it, why get the vaccine? **My solution - politicians are assholes, just because someone doesn't wear the mask doesn't automatically mean the virus is fake, and it doesn't mean the vaccine will eventually kill us all.**
* 5G plus pollutants are causing it (I still don't have an answer for this except 5G shouldn't be part of that conversation. Instead, if this is true I argue that it is caused by common parasites plus pollutants) - this statement says that the other global pandemics happened during a time of increased electricity, and the idea is that our bodies are reacting to the new electromagnetic fields in the same way, and everyone just calls it a virus. **However this doesn't explain why people who live far away from 5G also have covid.**
* many top HIV and mRNA researchers were killed on flights MH370 and MH17. **I found only a few scientists on those flights, not nearly as many as claimed. So this one is another hit against the conspiracy theorists.**

**And my own favorite pro-vaccine argument, made by me:** If politicians wanted to kill a bunch of people by giving them vaccines, it wouldn't make any sense, because Democrats are more likely to take them than Republicans are. So what would happen? They want to make the country majority Republican? I don't think so!

Overall, the conspiracy theories against the vaccine are pretty weak arguments. However, personally, I don't go out very much, so I'm weighing my very minimal chance of getting the virus against the very minimal chance that the vaccine is designed to kill people by acting as a slow poison. How crazy do I sound?

\---

Now I will ramble a bit about stuff.

I read the moderna sheet, and it says that the shot doesn't provide immunity. It only prevents and reduces symptoms if you get infected, and it also doesn't prevent transmission, which is why everyone should still wear masks.

I heard on the news months ago that the protection from mRNA might not last very long, not sure how reliable that is.

TB, tetanus, and Meningitis vaccines seem to have a very long immunity window after being vaccinated with those. Flu shots are hit or miss, sometimes I wonder if they do anything at all, but that's apparently because there are many strains of the common flu and the annual flu shots are just guesses.

I don't know how long the mRNA produces the spike protein, or how long the body would keep antibodies and T cells around to protect against it. Recently I've also heard that the spike protein itself could cause damage to the body (from conspiracy sites), but if that's true **it's still better to be vaccinated with a low dose than get infected with a high dose.**

mRNA is supposed to degrade within hours or days. They have to store them far below room temp, so the mRNA itself shouldn't last very long inside the body. But maybe it lasts longer inside the cell.

Have also heard that the spike protein already exists in the body, and if you get the vacc, your body will start to attack its own organs (conspiracy theory). I don't understand why that would be the case because if that were true, **the body would already be attacking its own organs.** I don't think mRNA can teach your body to attack something that isn't harming it, but I could be wrong. And this statement (spike proteins naturally inside organs) is from the same people who think the spike protein damages you on its own, not only the whole virus. **So those two ideas are in direct contradiction to each other.**

I'm currently waiting for Covaxin or CoronaVac to be approved for EUA in the US. If it takes too long I'll go with pfizer or moderna. Covaxin and CoronaVac are inactive viruses, just like the old vaccines we're used to, so no mRNA shenanigans to be worried about with those.

However, in the long run, mRNA vaccines could totally replace inactive virus vaccines, because they're faster to produce against new strains. And theoretically mRNA is much better ethically, because it isn't grown in a lab by infecting animals or mixing viruses inside synthetic animal tissues, which just sounds like all kinds of wrong. If mRNA is the future then I feel like an old grandpa who refuses to accept new technology. This is the major reason why I might just go ahead and get the shot instead of waiting for a traditional vaccine.

Thanks for reading. I hope you got an insight into the thought process of a skeptical, possibly-intelligent person who has been hesitant to get vaccinated. When I finish my taxes, I'll probably get that shot.",1620742861.0,2021-05-11 07:21:01

Tl;dr: throughout the day after my first dose, I had bouts of 102-103 degrees F fever, severe chills and fatigue, soreness. Tylenol, hydration, rest and positive thoughts got me through it. I woke up the next day feeling fine.

**Saturday**

10:20am: injection of Moderna vaccine

7:00pm: noticing arm is sore

**Sunday**

5:30am: awoken by VERY sore arm, took one Tylenol extra strength, checked temp (97F), went back to sleep.

6:30am: awoken by mild chills. Prepared a warm tea. By the time I was done my chills were pretty bad. Layered up and went back to bed. Exhausted, couldn't even look at my phone.

8:00am: chills returned despite being fully layered. Took a double Tylenol. Tried to eat but had no appetite. Went back to bed, couldn't sleep. Was warm, started shedding layers as the chills stopped.

12:00pm: warm despite having few layers. Moved to different spot downstairs. Felt faint while walking but made it down okay. Fever was back up, 102.6F. 

1:00pm: chills returned. double dose of Tylenol.

2:00pm: managed to get a bit of sleep in. Some energy returned. Temperature dropped below 100F. I could use my phone and take short walks, although it was difficult because of the fatigue and dizziness. My heart rate, which was hovering around 85 BPM while I was lying down (normal 55-60 BPM) shot up to around 120 BPM just while walking a short distance. My Fitbit thought I was exercising - it certainly felt like it!

7:00pm: my chills returned and my fever was 103F. Took a single advil liquidgel, which brought the temperature down over the next hour.

9:00pm: was feeling better, but exhausted from a hard day of healing! I could walk short distances again. Went to bed with another liquidgel. No chills or fever at the time of going to bed.

I slept restlessly until midnight, but then slept through the night until 6:30am on Monday. I feel much better now. My temperature is normal, heartrate normal and I can walk around without feeling dizzy. Taking the day off work today to get some real rest.

No regrets and absolutely will get my second dose when I am eligible (4 months from now for Canadians). I can take a few days of uncomfortable but harmless side effects over COVID-19!

**Update:** I took Monday off work to rest for the day. My symptoms were mostly gone, though I had a brief 101F fever that dropped with one Advil. Today is Tuesday and although I haven't had a fever, it's been hard to focus on work (but then again, when is the day after a 3 day weekend easy?)",1620678056.0,2021-05-10 13:20:56

Hoping everyone is doing well.

4/8/21 - I got my first Moderna shot. I experienced no immediate reaction. 24hrs after the shot I had notable pain at the point of injection, and using that arm for the smallest task was unpleasant.

About 32hrs after that first shot the chills set in. I felt chilled to the bone to the point my teeth were chattering uncontrollably. I eventually settled down enough at 11pm to sleep.

At 4AM I awoke to strong feelings of nausea, lightheadedness, and weakness. Upon going to the bathroom to potentially throw up, I had to sit down quickly on the bathroom floor in order not to fall over when I passed out. I lost consciousness for a few seconds and just sat on the floor until I could move again, and I drank as much water as I could.

Spent the rest of that morning feeling lightheaded and weak, until I forced myself to eat and drink a little more at 8am, and napped till 10, where I felt exponentially better.

5/7/21 - Very similar to the first shot with a few key differences. Less pain at the point of injection. The hellish response to the vaccine started at around 20hrs after injection. This time when I passed out I wasn't able to lower myself to the ground quick enough and I ended falling backwards into my shower. My body also ached all over.

Feelings of weakness and lightheadedness persisted for two days afterwards. Other aches and pains were difficult to identify as being related, since I did fall and bumped myself up a bit when I passed out.

I would definitely suggest planning the day after the vaccine around having potentially negative side affects.",1620694066.0,2021-05-10 17:47:46

\-stash some gatorade or pedialyte in your fridge.

\-have food already prepared. we had pho from a restaurant we like and put it in the fridge the night before and then reheated it during the day. if you don't want to order out, make yourself something like mac and cheese and put it in the fridge to reheat later.

\-NSAIDS (avoid if you can, don't pregame them, read up on the pros and cons of taking them and how they can affect your immune system, and make a choice for yourself. a friend took powdered tylenol and said it was easy to do when she was sick. i waited until later the next day to take ibuphrophen)

\-water. lots of water. thought water in advance didn't seem to help me much, even though i drank an entire gallon the hour before. but good to drink it in life. so drink water.

\-buy a cheap thermometer on amazon

\-a comfortable sleeping place, if you are lucky enough to have one. if not, do your best to make yourself a nice little nest. if it's your jam, computer ready and charged up for movie time.

\-a strong reaction means a strong immune system! don't fret if your body doesn't react the way you want it to or expect it to.

\-make a plan for your children, animals, anything or anyone you personally need to care for.

\-alert your employer if that's the right choice for you. plan on a sick day, worst case it's a free day.",1620607238.0,2021-05-09 17:40:38

Long hauler experience w/ moderna,5,n8ljlh,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n8ljlh/long_hauler_experience_w_moderna/,3,"Greetings!  I had my 1st shot of moderna around the 4th of March.  After about 7 or 8 hours my arm felt like I was rocked by Mike Tyson.  I didn't sleep that well that night and for the next 3 or 4 days I felt like I was hit by a bus.  I just payed around sore and couldn't do shit.  I eventually started to feel better and my heart rate actually went down a couple of beats per minute on average. My heart has been racing since I got covid in March of 2020 and my blood pressure has been higher as well.  I was put on metoprolol in january which has really helped.  So I was in the low 70s before the shot and it brought me to the high 60s after the first shot.  This was a positive.

A few days after the shot I noticed a sensitivity to loud noises.  I have to turn my phone down very low and noises just hurt.  I don't have a ringing in my ear (tinnitus), this appears to be strictly hyperacusis.  Also my gi symptoms have been a lot worse then what they were before the vaccine. I will say my gi issues were very bad in december and it sent me back to the hospital.  So I am not sure if the vaccine is to blame.

On April 1st I received my 2nd moderna shot.  I experienced the exact same symptoms I had with the first shot.  Again it took about 4 days for these to resolve.  Essentially, it felt like mike tyson punched me and I was hit by a bus.  I did opt to get the shot in my right arm this time because I prefer to sleep on my left side.  After a few days my heart rate again dropped.  Now I am in the low to mid 60s.  This is much closer to my precovid base.  

Fast forward to now.. over the past week I have felt like shit.  My gi issues have been bad since I got the first shot.  So bad that I have had a upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy.  I'm only 38 so I'm a bit young. I didn't have any polyps or cancer. I had mild peptic duodenitis but that's not my problem. They don't know wtf my problem is.  I suspect it is inflammation.  I think my entire body has inflammation.  My eyes balls are red and my hands and fingertips are red and burn. My gut just hurts and hurts. I've had my cytokines measured twice and was given a long hauler score of 2.2 the first time.  Ivermectin seemed to drive down my rantes and interferon based on the results of the second test.  

I am not sure what the fuck is going on but my guess is that there is an autoantibody component at play here. I am not sure what is causing that or how much influence the vaccine had at exacerbating the issue.  Has anyone else had a similar issue?

Edit.. I also had an antibody test conducted 4 weeks after the 2nd dose.  I tested positive for antibodies >250u/ml on LabCorp test.",1620617414.0,2021-05-09 20:30:14

I received my first shot on April 9th. Within 24 hrs I was just very tired slept almost throughout the whole day of receiving shot and next day. Arm was also extremely sore for about 3 days then it was perfectly back to normal. I received my second shot May 7th (this past Friday). It has been about 36 hours and I have had no side effects other than a sore arm at the injection site which is way less painful than it was on my first shot and is wearing off already. I am also experiencing some tiredness but nothing out of the ordinary. Hopefully this eases the minds of some of us. I‚Äôll keep you all posted if anything changes,1620607299.0,2021-05-09 17:41:39

I'm healthy, eat healthy for the most part & I don't get sick easily (last time I was sick was Nov 2019).

1st shot (4.9): I didnt feel the needle at all but I did get a head rush of a headache that lasted for 5 seconds. Then about 6 hours later I started to feel fatigued, and by 8pm I had to go to bed & had the chills for a little bit. I slept through the night & woke up the next morning at 6am & felt 100% better. My period is usually heavy but it did seem a bit heavier for the first couple of days (hard to say if it was related or just hormonal).

2nd shot (5.7): The pharmacist told me not to take acetaminophen for the first 6 hours, to drink a lot of water & that people who experienced harsh symptoms did so 12 hours later. The shot hurt which was surprising, & my arm was aching within a couple hours but I did wait 6 hours. I got the chills in the afternoon but a bowl of soup helped cure it. Before & after the shot I was chugging water. I usually drink 1-2 gallons of water a day but I drank at least 3 gallons (maybe 4), 1 liter of pedialyte & a gatorade, and still had moments throughout the evening where I felt really thirsty. By 10pm I was very tired & slept through the night with no issues. I woke up the next day with a runny nose & sneezing - felt like the shot intensified my allergies lol, so I took an antihistamine later in the day. I was also fatigued & had some joint pain yesterday -just felt unwell all day- so I just relaxed & continued drinking a lot of water, pedialyte & gatorade. Today I woke up feeling 100% better & my allergies are hardly noticeable. As for my arm pain, once I took acetaminophen after 6 hours on 5.7 I felt relief about 30 mins later, & since then the soreness is almost gone (I moved my arm around a lot & didnt avoid sleeping on it).

I would recommend drinking a ton of water & having pedialyte or gatorade on hand. It's definitely good to prepare for harsh symptoms but just remember that everyone responds differently (& any symptoms you experience means that your body is learning to protect itself). It's such a relief to have gotten both shots, & I'll feel even more relieved in 2 weeks. So grateful! :)",1620603764.0,2021-05-09 16:42:44

Moderna Dose 2 Side Effects - Changes to Period,4,n85wn0,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n85wn0/moderna_dose_2_side_effects_changes_to_period/,0,"32/F, smoker, decent health, my first dose just gave me a sore arm for about a week. My second dose was 5/6 and went something like this...

Got the shot at 8:20 am and was fine with just a bit of a sore arm for 12 hours.

Around 8 pm I started getting chills, body she's, sore skin, some emotional turmoil, and started spotting. 

By 9 pm I was miserable with really hard to deal with shivering and my skin was super duper sensitive and I wanted to cry a lot. I ran a slight fever (above 99 but below 101) most of the night. There was lots of sweating. My joints hurt. My muscles hurt. I couldn't sleep in one position for more than an hour or so. I took one ibuprofen and drank lots of water. 

By 8 am on 5/7 the fever had gone for good, but I was tired, my skin was clammy, and my muscles and joints were still pretty sore. I slept a lot but managed to sit in car lines to pick my kids up from school. I could eat but had no real appetite for anything. My eyes were also super dry/sore/tired or whatever. I took acetaminophen in the form of bc powder for maybe severe allergies (100% don't recommend taking acetaminophen like this because it is gross) and drank lots of water. 

5/8 (today) I feel almost 100%. My body is still a little weird as far as handling outside temperatures goes. My skin has still been a little clammy and my neck is stiff. I have some muscles that are kind of sore sometimes. My arm is still a little sore at the injection site but it isn't as bad as it was after my first dose. I have taken regular bc powder for my neck stiffness today. As of right this moment, my neck is still a little stiff but I am 100% otherwise. 

As far as my period goes, which is most of why I want to put my specific experience out there since most of my symptoms are super common, things are wonky for me. I take birth control so that I have 1 period every 2 months. My last period ended a week before I got my second dose. While, sometimes, I don't always make it the full 2 months before my body decides it needs to shed my uterus lining, I have always (for at least 4 years) been able to make it more than a month between periods. I started spotting a bit right when my other ""real"" (fever, skin sensitivity, muscle aches) symptoms started and have moved on to having a normal period. I get that it's anecdotal, but I think its worth mentioning. 

Also 10/10 would recommend. Just like my laborswith my kids, I've fought the hard fight and have come out on the other side better than before. But, just like my labors, I hope to never have to do it again.",1620561511.0,2021-05-09 04:58:31

I woke up a little better this morning but I'm now feeling worse again. I was really scared about having to get a second shot because of how bad this first one is.  After talking to my neighbors, though, I have come to realize that very strong reactions up to a week or more are quite common. As long as I know that I'm not having an unusual averse reaction, I can tough this out. There are some people who feel that no one should talk about their bad reactions so it doesn't scare off people, but I am of the other train of thought.

Moderna experience (both shots) - 25F,6,n82i6t,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n82i6t/moderna_experience_both_shots_25f/,0,"Wanted to share my experiences with both doses of Moderna, since I spent a good deal of time on this sub in preparation (mostly motivated by health anxiety, honestly).

I'm 25F, overweight but no BP/cholesterol issues, etc. Don't exercise much, eat well overall, take multivitamin + C + fish oil daily, but definitely don't stay as hydrated as I should. I do have a history of some really nasty respiratory infections since I was young, so I very much wanted to get vaccinated even though I didn't technically count as high-risk on paper.

Got the first dose a month ago. The day of the shot, I did feel a little tired and went to bed early, but that was it. Regarding the arm pain, the first dose was definitely the worst. It didn't really hit until later that evening right before bed - it was so painful I definitely couldn't lay on it to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, it was simply a dull ache that lasted one more day after that. However, my lymph node under my armpit did swell around that point; that actually hurt a moderate amount with movement and lasted over a week. Aside from those things, no other side effects.

Before dose 2, I prepared by drinking a LOT of water, Gatorade and other liquids starting two days beforehand. And it's hard to get me to stay hydrated, as I mentioned above, so it was definitely a commitment! But I say it absolutely paid off because my side effects were totally manageable.

Day of the second dose, I had 0 side effects and carried about my day as normal (still hydrating like mad!). Arm pain was way less severe (I got #2 in the same arm as the first one). Went to bed at my normal time. About 5 AM, I woke up with mild chills and acid reflux symptoms, but I got back to sleep within a half hour or so. I woke up at 8 to use the bathroom and noticed the lymph node pain + my back was drenched in sweat, so I took my temperature - 100F, but I didn't feel particularly feverish/bad. I went back to bed/woke up at 10 and honestly at that point it just felt like a hangover - dull headache, dull body aches, fatigue. Took 2 Tylenol and started my day with breakfast, did my teletherapy appt, and went to get coffee with my housemate in the afternoon feeling overall low-energy, but still functional. Around 4pm (when my Tylenol wore off) I felt pretty fatigued seemingly out of nowhere. Checked my temp, 99.3. Took 2 more Tylenol and took a nap for about 1.5 hours. When I woke up I felt perfectly fine, but I took it pretty easy overall for the rest of the night.

It's >48 hours since the shot and I can say I feel totally back to normal. No fever all day. Arm pain is almost nonexistent. Lymph node pain is minimal. Would 1000% do it again, but I definitely think staying hydrated made a difference. It's totally worth having to pee a million times a day if it means symptoms are like this!",1620549485.0,2021-05-09 01:38:05

And travel to see my in-laws overseas, whenever that is available again.

So I thought I'd share my not-too-bad experience to maybe help some people that see an overwhelming number of really bad experiences. I saw those too and they freaked me out.

I am roughly 18 hours post my 2nd shot. I've had very minimal symptoms for both shots. I was only a little tired after the first. No fevers or anything else.

My temp was 99.2 this morning, and it is now in the 98's. 

My arm hurts worse than after the first one but I'm still waving it around and lifting it every 10 mins or so to keep it from toghtening up. I also have been trying to use that arm more than the other one for lifting and such, just to keep it moving. If anyone has had Twinrix, it's about that painful. Not too bad.

My body aches a bit, like I did a full body workout yesterday, and my arm hair hurts (which is how I knew I was sick when I was a kid), but nothing that would stop me from my normal daily routine. 

I also have a very slight headache, just behind my eyes. I haven't even needed to take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for it, that's how mild it is. I just notice it a bit when I stare at my phone too long. Like now. Haha

Oh, also, I'm starving today. More than normal. 

Before the shot I drank roughly 1.5 times the normal amount of water I would normally drink, PLUS Gatorade and tea or coffee. 

Also, the sunshine and hot, humid Florida Spring weather feels *amazing* today. It's like my symptoms get even more minimal when I stand outside with my dogs. Yay vitamin D! 

4 out of 5 stars, would definitely do it again if I had to or if boosters are needed. Worth it to not be in the hospital and definitely worth it to not be on a ventilator.",1620515155.0,2021-05-08 16:05:55

I have to admit that I was petrified of having my second Moderna shot after a truly bizarre and horrendous two weeks after the first shot.

Backstory: 

I had my 1st Moderna on 4/9/21. Both my husband and I began having incredibly aggressive and strange/almost painful palpitations that got so bad over the next 24-48 hours that we drove down and sat in the parking lot of the local ER. It was really awful. I also ended up with both breasts swelled and lumpy and hot and hard, so painful I couldn't even touch them. Neck glands all swelled up. I ran a fever for the next 10-14 days (I can't remember the exact day it stopped) When the fever went away, so did the palpitations. The palpitations had gotten so bad I ended up at the doctors with a referral over to a cardiologist. Like I said, the fever went and so did the bizarre palps. My arm was so sore it was shocking. And, I got a period complete with cramps and bleeding even though I've been in menopause since 2019, have had a complete ablation AND have an existing Mirena. All of which make bleeding highly unlikely. This also prompted an appointment with my gyno which is pending.

Anyways...

We had our 2nd shot yesterday at 10:30am. It stung, but that was about it. Within an hour both my husband and I were getting sporadic episodes of the totally bizarre and extremely distinct palpitations that we had started getting within an hour of our 1st shot. 

My arm became sore very quickly this time and the soreness very rapidly spread to my breasts (and the tissue along the outside edges and under my armpits, both sides). 

But... I'm really excited to say that other than that (for me) I feel really great today. No chills. No fever. No period. No palpitations (just a few incidents yesterday afternoon). My arm feels like someone drove a 90 penny nail into the bone and my boobs have grown a full size, but I can deal with these things. I also have a huge egg that's appeared over the injection site - about the size of lemon, hot and firm.

My husband on the other hand is aching all over. Has the chills. Is very fatigued.",1620525596.0,2021-05-08 18:59:56
My experience with both shots,8,n7rfig,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n7rfig/my_experience_with_both_shots/,8,"44M, meh health (think ""dad bod"").  But eat relatively healthy and exercise fairly regularly.

First three paragraphs are the ""too long, don't wanna read?"" summary...

\-First shot, prepped with fluids/electrolytes.  ""Just"" had significant arm pain and moderate headaches for several days, Tylenol helped with both.  

\-Second shot, prepped with fluids/electrolytes and worked the arm a lot before & after.  Had minimal arm pain but terrible headaches, Tylenol didn't alleviate the head pain at all, but Advil helped quite a bit.  Also significant exhaustion, a little nausea, a few slight fever spikes (up to 100), a couple of short bouts of shivering & chills, and loss of appetite.  Someone mentioned yesterday some things tasted funny, and I noticed that with a few items, though it's gone now.  I also feel like I was overly sensitive to smells for a few days (emptying the cats' litter boxes was YIKES).  Mostly cleared in about 48 hours, though I still don't have much of an appetite.

\-My recommendation:  Extra hydration/electrolytes didn't prevent nasty side effects for me after the second shot, but maybe I didn't do it early enough...?  I'd still recommend others try it, because there really isn't any harm.  Maybe start a few days prior.  I worked/moved the arm a lot before and after the second shot, something I didn't for the first.  I can't say that's why it didn't hurt much after the second shot, but again, can't see the harm in it.  Try to get plenty of sleep the night before.  Have both Tylenol/acetaminophen and Advil/ibuprofen on hand.  Prep for chills (wish I had had warmer clothes close at hand when the chills hit me in the middle of the night...).  If you have that flexibility, take the time off from work.  If you live alone (like me), have a few folks you can check in with, and who can check in with you.

Okay, here's the long-winded, way-too-detailed stuff...

\-First dose:  Seven hours of sleep prior.  Prepped with fluid, 100 oz. water plus 32 oz. sugar free Gatorade before, plus my regular three cups of coffee.  Another 100 oz. water plus 32 oz. sugar free Gatorade the rest of the day after the shot.  I should note that I usually take in around 200 oz. of water daily, so that wasn't out of the ordinary for me.

Didn't feel the actual shot  (late morning 4/6) at all.  Stayed the fifteen minutes, flexing and shaking my arm.  Only issues after were a very sore, painful arm that lasted for four or five days, and a few bad headaches.  Tylenol helped the headaches and arm pain.  Otherwise no change to my day-to-day existence.

\-Second dose:  7.5 hours of sleep prior.  Prepped with fluid, this time 100 oz. water plus 32 oz. regular Gatorade, and no coffee.  I had read somewhere recently to skip caffeine before getting a vaccination, and my buddy, who is not an expert in this field, said that some of the artificial sweeteners in the sugar free Gatorade could lead to inflammation and thus more body pains.  100 oz. water plus 32 oz. regular Gatorade after, plus a 20 oz. bottle of Coke I picked up at the pharmacy --  I had a slight headache going in, and I think it was because I tried to go cold turkey on the caffeine, so I grabbed the Coke immediately after for a caffeine hit.  This was a LOT more sugar than I usually consume in a given day; not sure if that made a difference, but trying to account for anything that can affect how I felt later.  I also had one packet in the hours after the shot of ""Basic Care"", which I guess is like a generic version of Pedialyte, that I got off Amazon.

Unlike the morning of the first shot, I exercised before starting my work day.  In addition to a short 30-minute jog, I did some light resistance work, including push-ups and several upper-body/arm workouts with resistance bands.  I wanted to emphasize that I worked the arm that got the shot several hours prior...

I felt the shot  (late morning 5/4) this time.  It felt like the pharmacist (same one from first shot) knuckled me in the arm.  I was also aware of her depressing the syringe (is that the right term?), and the process felt like it took several seconds longer than the first.  I stayed the required fifteen minutes, and worked my arm the entire time (windmills, flexing, shaking).  I then did some quick shopping, moving my arm the entire time; I'm sure I looked odd waving my arm while walking through the store...

The shot was pretty much midway through my work day, so I had four hours to go after I got back to work (at home).  Whenever possible, I grabbed a light dumbbell and worked the shot arm.  Not sure if all that arm work made any difference, but I had very little discomfort in my arm after the shot, and what little I had was pretty much gone in two days.  

By the time my shift ended, my head was pounding (this is when I found Tylenol was useless this time around, for whatever reason).

The evening after the shot and the next day were awful. That's when all the symptoms I described earlier were felt, though not all at the same time.  I continued to hydrate the next day, 200 oz. of water, two more Gatorades, and another packet of the faux Pedialyte.  

I started to feel a lot better at about the 46-hour mark, and it was sudden, not gradual.  Plopped down in my recliner, feeling like crap, got up an hour later with just a mild headache, and felt fine otherwise.  

I've had worse illnesses in the past, but this still sucked.

Again, sorry for being so long-winded, but  I appreciated seeing all the details and experiences in this sub when I was prepping, so I wanted to pay it forward.  To those who are nervous about side effects, I've got your (virtual) back!  Feel free to ask any questions.  To those who didn't have any side effects, screw you!  Just kidding, I'm legit happy for you, and I hope that's the case for everyone reading this who still needs their shots.  For those who are suffering after the shots, especially long-term, I wish I could help.  Sending prayers, vibes, positive thoughts your way.  If you just wanna chat, hit me up.",1620516062.0,2021-05-08 16:21:02
Second shot experience,8,n7og74,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n7og74/second_shot_experience/,5,"30/f, smoker.
My first shot was pretty uneventful, but I was really nervous about the second.

Got my second shot on 5/6, and luckily had very mild symptoms. For the next 24 hours, I was a little more tired than normal, nausea that would come and go, and just overall felt like I was just running at 75%. Didn‚Äôt feel great, but still functional. 

A couple things I think helped, the days leading up to the shot I avoided alcohol and made sure to extra hydrate. Water and Gatorade constantly before and after the shot. 

The second was a tip from my pharmacist who administered my shot. He explained how the muscle at the injection sight is like a giant sponge, and that to avoid a lot of soreness you should try to massage the area, and do arm stretches every 10 minutes. He did what he called piano fingers, which is just drumming the fingers firmly on injection sight for 10 seconds, then rub circles firmly over the area for another 10 seconds. 

Before my shot I know I read every single post, learning people‚Äôs experiences and trying to find any tips. I have no way of knowing if the extra hydration is what kept my symptoms minimal or if I‚Äôm just lucky, but I know it helped my anxiety feeling like I could do something to prepare!",1620506571.0,2021-05-08 13:42:51

Don‚Äôt get me wrong-I‚Äôm still cautious, I know there is still danger, as the case counts are still too high and many others aren‚Äôt getting the vaccine. But,
I have so much more control over my life that this virus took away from me. 

Feeling this relief also brings me pain. For the millions of people who have died from Covid. For the Covid long-haulers still struggling from the effects of this virus.

1st shot: Worst of the 2.  As far as I know, I did not ever have Covid, so not sure why.

* Headache, aches and pains over entire body, congestion, fatigue entire next day.  No other symptoms including no fever, no shot arm pain, no stomach problems, no tachycardia, etc.

* Back to normal 2nd day after, so not too bad

2nd shot: I was scared after reading this Reddit, so I drank a bottle of Pedialyte and 4-6 Gatorades the day of/after this time

* Fatigue, some slight minor congestion the next day

* The 2nd day after (today) I was doing fine until evening when I got tired and some slight pressure and congestion in my head/eyes but it passed after a few hours. No other symptoms. Feels like I will be 100% tomorrow.  


Summary: Complete breeze. I used to have A.Fib and was cured (so far) by ablation and still suffer from occasional palps but nothing major. As a result I am super aware of my heart and was fearing palps/tachycardia after reading some people suffered from that but nothing of the sort happened.

However I was much more anxious about contracting covid, given that the majority of people in my area are reluctant to get vaccinated or even wear masks despite us having a high rate of infection. I'm healthy in every aspect besides some minor lung issues, which has made me extremely careful since this all started. 

My first dose:

My side affects were virtually non existent. My arm was a bit sore, and a week after injection I got a small rash at the injection site. It cleared it up within a couple of days.

My second dose:

I was especially nervous about this one. I received it in the opposite arm this time due to the rash from the first. After about 9 hours, the soreness started. It was pretty intense, but I made sure to move around and stretch throughout the day, load up on calories, and stay hydrated. It was only when I stayed still for an extended period of time that the aching would start again. At 12 hours, I did get a slight, low grade fever that broke quickly after taking Tylenol. At 24 hours, I only felt slightly fatigued. Once I slept it off, all of my symptoms were gone.

It's been well over 48 hours now and it's as if it never happened. My period is a day late, but irregularity has never been unusual for me, so I can't say that it has anything to do with the vaccine. I expect that in a little less than a week I'll get another rash, but I'm not as concerned as I was the first time now that I know its normal.

I did massage my arm and windmill it for fifteen minutes (on and off). Ate fine afterward in a small amount since I wasn't feeling too well stomach wise recently. 

12:00 PM - Arm started feeling a little stiff and slight swelling. It did swell a few days pretty bad. A week after my first shot, I had the rash and more swelling.

1:00 PM - started to feel a little hot and went upstairs. I don't have a thermometer. Rested with Door (cat) in my lap on a small tv show binge. I decided to take the edge off with smoking (legal here). Took two Tylenol.

4:00 PM - Too hot upstairs with vent running heat (duplex house...in half. The owner on other side controls it, not us and closing vent still gets through), even with a fan. Decided to ice swollen section of arm and aching shoulder joint. Might have done more harm than help. It feels...stiffer, heavier than before I iced it. I wish I could check my temp. Drinking lots of ice water. Been reading for a bit. A cool shower is tempting. Will edit this post until end of day every few hours.

Worked on watercolor samples for a piece to make sure are right, then suddenly felt so tired.

5:00 PM - Napped for a little over a hour. Woke with my arm muscle the shot was in hurts, feels tight, like a drawn bow. Can't lift with it. On and off feeling over heated. Ate. Went to watch a show for an hour. Took two Tylenol in addition to first before.

6:00 PM - laid down to listen to podcast.

7:00 PM - fell asleep listening to podcast.

8:00 PM - woke up briefly, alone, stiff arm, hurting shoulder joint as well. Back to sleep after.

9:30 PM - woke up hot, muscle where shot is swollen worse, shoulder joint pain. Just took one more Tylenol because of a dull headache and smoked a little bit. Likely going upstairs to paint and hopefully sleep soon.",1620452131.0,2021-05-07 22:35:31

The area where I received the shot is discolored like I have a sunburn and it feels like I have waffle skin there. No fever but awful chills and my body hurt all over. I would cough and it felt like I was being punched in the ribs. I felt like a walk ad for death. I have had the flu a couple times but cannot ever remember feeling as bad as I did the next day. Took the day off from work and basically laid on the couch the entire day drinking water and gatorade but was never hungry. 

Over the past two days I have gotten incrementally better. I got the shot Tuesday afternoon and it is currently Friday afternoon. I would say I feel 85-90% of my normal day to day. Im amazed at how much better I feel than I did two days ago and its clear that the vaccine is doing exactly what it is supposed to.

I noticed I had zero appetite and that my appetite ""just wasn't there""... it wasn't because I was feeling pukey or anything. It's just like my appetite vanished.

Now I am admittedly over weight 190lbs, female and am almost always hungry even if I have already eaten. My doctors know this and a lot stems from having unmedicated narcolepsy at the moment.

So here I am... almost 2 weeks out, feeling good and still have no appetite and this is FANTASTIC!!!!!

I don't know if it affects hunger hormones in the brain or gut but something changed and I am happy! I feel like I won the vaccine lottery or something after the first horrible few days.

I decided to call Moderna's adverse effects line and told them everything in case they start to find a pattern in other people. The guy I spoke to said that they do want to know things like this that aren't necessarily bad. Who knows maybe, just maybe they might find some component of the vaccine will help with weight loss drugs in the future. A weight loss vaccine maybe? Wouldn't that be amazing!?

BTW this did not happen with my first dose.

So... if you are experiencing this and decide to call the hotline please do me a huge favor. Please mention my post so they don't start wondering why today a boatload of people all decided to call the hotline about this weird side effect. Let them know you saw my post and that I encouraged others who also are experiencing this to let them know. They don't know what they don't know! So if you have any ""good"" side effects call them!

I called the Moderna hotline directly that is on their contact page... I did not contact the CDC.

If this happened to you and you are still experiencing this will you please comment below how far out from the dose you are and if you still have no appetite. 

BTW... after not being able to lose weight forever I have lost a solid 4 lbs over the 2 weeks so far. This is not water weight and I have lost a whole belt notch too.

The fever lasted 1.5 days, I did not take any medication whatsoever. 48 hours after the shot I was back to 100%. 3 weeks after and I've had heart rate going up sometimes, but really can't associate that with the vaccine.

First dose - 2/15. I am 11 weeks out and will be 12 weeks out next week. Never got the second one because of my side effects. 

A few hours after my shot I felt some tingling and numbness in both my cheeks and my jaw felt kinda stiff. Soon after I had a pain go from my top right side of my head down to behind my right ear. At this point - I was freaking out, and kept waking up every time I went to bed.

In the coming days I would get what felt like stiffness above my eyebrows and down my nose and still had tingling just about everywhere. 

Over the last 11 weeks I‚Äôve had: migraines, joint pain, nerve pain, the worst anxiety I‚Äôve ever had, depression (never had this before), irregular menstrual cycle (first one was fine second one was late, light, and short), the worst insomnia, tingling and burning on my skin, weird vibrating sensations, lymphatic swelling, shakiness, and slight hand tremors, muscle spasms. 

Today 11 weeks out I am still dealing with: anxiety, depression, problems sleeping, minor skin/nerve sensations that come sometimes, migraines some times, slight internal vibrations sometimes.

This has honestly been 3 of the roughest months of my life. I have never cried more than I have in the last couple of months. Literally all of my loved ones have gotten Pfizer and are totally fine. I should‚Äôve waited. 

I have a background in science and have always been a big fan of science and vaccines. I‚Äôm up to date on all of mine (lol). 

I‚Äôve gotten ALL the tests btw: MRI, cat scan, angiography, EMG, ekg, echo cardio gram, ultrasounds - everything I‚Äôve gotten back so far has been fine, even my autoimmune tests (waiting on a few more to come back), and I have some outstanding tests that I‚Äôm waiting on for hormone levels and thyroid stuff.

I‚Äôve got a great network of family and friends being supportive, but this has honestly been awful. I thankfully have a solid number of antibodies after my first dose, so I have bought myself some time before I need to do this again - but I can assure you it won‚Äôt be Moderna. 

Before you complain about me complaining lol and this being my first post - I had another account and got rid of it, because I didn‚Äôt like being added to any conspiracy theory mess. 

Thankfully - I have a great team of doctors, and will be seeing a great psychiatrist for the first time next week. She‚Äôs not big on Rx and does more CBT which I appreciate. Hoping that I can put this chapter behind me

Relatively great shape, lift about 4 times a week and run around 3 times a week. I also work at Amazon 4 days a week and do moderate to heavy lifting at the warehouse. After 7 years in the Army I've been through a plethora of vaccine and immunizations hahaha. Not a normal amount. 

Received my first dose of Moderna in April at 6:30pm. Felt strange while waiting the twenty minutes at Kroger, couldn't put my finger on it. Got home and felt fine and went to bed around 9pm. At 2am I woke up with tachycardia and hyper tension. My usual resting heart rate is 50s to 60s and my BP is 120s/70s. My HR was at 127 and my BP was 153/90. This lasted for about an hour and then settled down. For two days after I had headaches and that was it. 

Received 2nd dose of Moderna yesterday May 5 at 3:pm. Had immediate sore arm. Went to sleep at 9pm and couldn't even fall asleep because of slight tachycardia. It was between 80 to 90 which is high for me. That lasted until about 3am this time. Finally got some rest and have literally been in THE WORST PAIN I've felt in my life. My achyness is on a whole other level I've never truly felt before. It's like squatting heavy after not doing it for months except the soreness is everywhere. Sharp pain in joints is awful. It's just been a miserable day. I can hardly walk around. Staying in bed just gives my back and legs pain and I can't sleep. At most a 99.4 fever.

Positive 2nd Dose Experience (Autoimmune/MCAS/POTS/long-hauler),7,n6hs3b,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n6hs3b/positive_2nd_dose_experience/,21,"**37f/ rheumatoid arthritis, MCAS, POTS or OI, long haul issues since March 2020 - I am not currently on anything for any of my conditions, but I use Benadryl/Pepcid/quercetin as needed and have an epi pen.**

I'm two hours past my second dose and all is well so far.  Felt a little tingly up my arm right after the shot and a tiny bit tight in my throat, then some brief nausea.  Went away with Gatorade, so I think it was just a blood sugar dip.  I will update this post if anything weird happens.  It's looking to be a beautiful weekend here in the PNW and I am strongly hoping I get to skip the side effects!  (First shot made me very hungry, and I had some cystic acne pop up with my period being a couple days late.)

Edit 1 - I woke up thirsty as usual at 1:30 am after going to bed around 10:30. I would say my body aches were at a 5.5/10 when I went to sleep and they're about a 5 now and seem to be receding. As opposed to being super hungry for a solid week after shot 1, food doesn't sound good, but maybe that's because I had a ton of chicken soup before bed. Muscles are a little jumpy in the way they tend to get when I'm sick or having an RA flare. I'm also pretty congested. 

This is nowhere near as bad as many of the times I've had sinusitis, which turns into a whole-body sadness affair generally. This is NOTHING like my reactions to the tetanus booster (which women in my maternal side may actually be allergic to), and definitely nowhere as bad as the pneumococcal, where my fever wouldn't stop climbing with round the clock tylenol and advil. (Took Benadryl to get that to stop eventually, on the advice of an NP friend.) 

I might get up and take a hot shower if I don't fall back asleep soon, but I'm glad this isn't terrible. Oh and my arm is less sore than last time,  but even that wasn't too bad.

Edit 2 - It got a little worse in the early hours and I definitely felt icky. Body aches and pains like a 6.5/10, so like having the flu. Bit of a headache came on. I'm surprisingly already feeling better though! Body aches down to a 3 or 4. I took a couple hot baths through the night which helped the aches and pains. No Advil or Tylenol at any point because I couldn't find them. Lol. But soooo much hydration. I probably drank about 400 oz total of soup, Gatorade, water and coconut water since getting my shot up til now. Really makes a difference.

Edit 3 - I took some Advil around 1 pm and fell asleep. Woke up feeling pretty much fine, just tired now.

Edit 4 - Two days post shot, feeling fine now.  Arm isn't too sore but there's a small goose egg where I got my shot.  Most of that arm is covered with a sleeve but in the non-colored bits it looks a little red.

Edit 5 - Four days out, arm swelling and pain almost totally gone (a little itchy like when something's healing). Broke out in roseacea across my face, but that's typical enough with my autoimmune stuff (although never quite this much). Have had a couple night sweats the last couple nights and woke up a few times due to indigestion. Still feel fine otherwise.

Edit 6 - had a couple days of bad GERD (acid reflux) and mild hives around the six day mark.  Not unusual w/ my MCAS.  Took some quercetin and it was gone within two days.  Feeling totally fine now (nine days post-shot 2).",1620364214.0,2021-05-06 22:10:14
2nd shot today.,3,n6my26,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n6my26/2nd_shot_today/,1,"*UPDATE
MAY 11,2021

Went to the ER yesterday because of the feeling in my chest and throat was uncomfortable enough. Exhausted, weak and just having the irritating, burning heat radiating out my chest was too dam much. 

I also felt it in my back, neck and arms. After leaving the ER I was diagnosed with Pleuritic pain, adverse effect of vaccine. 

Now, I did say I partake, but not in quantities that would subject me to this, but could be an aggravator for sure. So being an intelligent being, I am gonna chill on that for a bit.

I was precribed viscous lidocaine (ewww) and methylprednislone.

MAY 6,2021

Ok so I am 6 hours after last shot and I switched arms and went with the jab in the (R) arm.  So far ,400mg ibuprofen and 1grm joint filed with 60/40 indica dominate strain for two sets of pains; cause of course my lady bits are busy this week. 

Now what was fascinating is that just after my ovulation was ending last week and my 29 yrs old visitor was checking in, I started to get this weird feeling in my chest and pain in the shoulders and neck. 

I'm gonna update. But my body is like ,look b. You are in your 40's, you should have scheduled this better.",1620379178.0,2021-05-07 02:19:38
Documenting 2nd dose journey,18,n69dvb,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n69dvb/documenting_2nd_dose_journey/,3,"28F. Just got my second shot (hooray!!!).

For my first shot, other that arm pain, I did not experience any discomfort. I had covid on October last year, loosing my smell and taste for a week. No other symptoms. 

9:45 am - received my second shot. It is currently 11 am and all is well.

(I'll keep updating this to keep track of any secondary effects)

Edits:

12:00 pm - I'm starting to feel my arm sore. Not really painful. Mostly stiff.

1:36 pm - started feeling a pinch like on the injection site. Lasted some minutes and is gone now. It is starting to feel difficult rising my arm above the shoulder. Annoying but tolerable. I felt good to cook myself a meal.

3:00 pm - started feeling a little sleepy for a bit, it went away. The arm has not gotten any worse.

4:30 pm - I'm starting to feel very tired, and my legs are feeling heavier, maybe some chills? I'll probably go to sleep earlier today. Just checked and I don't have a fever. Nothing different in my arm.

6:10 pm - nothing much has changed but wanted to keep the time cadence. I did make some tea, was feeling cold.

7:30 pm - Now I'm definitely feeling fatigued. I picture myself as a sloth whenever I'm trying to do anything. My body feels very heavy, and my temperature is beguining to rise. I am at 99.3F as of now. My arm can now be raised to 45 deg, and that's it. On the good note, no headache or anything else.

At least my inmune system is awake and working...

7:57 - I am having chills, and am now at 100F, oh and had a laugh attack (?)

8:50 - Fever at 100.4 F. My back, legs, and neck hurt pretty bad (flu like, I guess?). My skin feels super sensitive right now, like I feel like I am conscious of the fabric texture on my skin. A bit of mind fogginess. No headache. The chills have finally stopped, at least for now. Hanging in there I suppose?

Had a meeting very early tomorrow, so already let them know I'll probably won't be there. Just have to finish some stuff so I can run to bed.

9:27 pm - Calling it a night. I just want to lie in my bed. Hopefully I can get a nice sleep. Will continue updating as I wake up. My fever is at 100.5 F right now. Just took advil to bring it down.

**Day 2 after second dose**

10.20 am - Surprisingly, I slept well. Not my best sleep, but good enough. Due to fever I kept drinking a lot of water, which resulted in a lot of comings and goings to the bathroom. I could not move a lot in bed because of the arm. I am waking up without a fever, the fatigue and body pain are gone.. For now. The arm soreness has also reduced and I can move it a little more.

12:20 pm - My body feels like I'd I had just completed an HIIT class. My legs in particular feel very exhausted and heavy. My mind is clear. The arm hurts, but I have kept moving it. I feel good enough to go grocery shopping.

2:50pm - I can feel my strength coming back to me, no fever. I still can't lift my arm, but that is slowly getting better.

5:10 pm - Other than the sore arm, all other symptoms are gone!

10:40 pm - probably my last edit. I'm feeling just fine, except for my arm, which I can only rise 90 degrees. Everything else is gone!

Don't hesitate. Get vaccinated!!",1620342346.0,2021-05-06 16:05:46
2nd dose experience so far,6,n6fa4y,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n6fa4y/2nd_dose_experience_so_far/,8,"Hello! 26F, no serious conditions or medical history. 

Got my 2nd dose at 11 am this morning. Right arm (right arm dominant). 

A very slight soreness in my arm so far as of 3 pm, but for right now that is all. As of this moment, the soreness in my arm after the first shot was worse (got my first dose in my dominant arm as well) will update later to let you know of any changes!

So very glad to have both shots under my belt now

Update: 7 pm now, my arm has increased in soreness by quite a bit and I'm feeling a bit fatigued.

Update: 7 am now. Horrible night honestly. Kept waking up. Ran a fever of 101 throughout the night. Really bad chills and muscle aching. Nausea about 3 am and it lasted till about 5 am. Super sore arm. However, my fever has reduced to 100 now and the chills are mostly gone. My muscles are still a bit sore, but, also the feeling is mostly gone. Horrible headache, but, that may or may not be a symptom as I suffer from chronic headaches. 

All in all, it was a horrible evening but the morning came and I'm still here. Feeling so much better than I did then, and knowing I'll have a pretty good immunity built up? I'm all for it. I cant imagine how the virus feels if that is how the vaccine feels.

Final update: 
It is now 5:30 and my fever is completely gone as well as the remainder of the chills. My headache is more or less gone. I'm feeling back to normal.",1620357764.0,2021-05-06 20:22:44

1st shot I had nothing right away except a sore arm.. I had a super delayed reaction at 2ish weeks, exhaustion, headaches and body aches as well as sore lymph nodes in the armpit I got the shot. The body aches lasted about 48 hrs, the lymph nodes and exhaustion lasted about 5. 

2nd shot arm not as sore but still pretty sore, I had been drinking a ton of liquid iv in the days before my shot and made sure to ‚Äúwindmill‚Äù my arm to help the soreness.. it helped A LOT. I got my shot at 4:30 on 5/4 no symptoms except the sore arm, 5/5 took ibuprofen as soon as I woke up, at around 4pm I started to feel super weird like maybe dizziness and what I can only describe as slight disassociation, skin started burning almost like a sunburn and body aches, I took a Pepcid and more ibuprofen and took a shower.. that relieved a lot while I was in the water.. when I got out I noticed a few hives on my thigh and I had bites from other things so I decided to take an antihistamine and smoke some weed, in 30 minutes I was 100% fine. It literally went away as quickly as it started.. so around 9pm gone aside from the slight arm soreness. I feel pretty convinced it was the antihistamine.

Two Weeks After Second Shot & Still Unwell,6,n5zdkk,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n5zdkk/two_weeks_after_second_shot_still_unwell/,12,"29F here looking for encouragement that I won't feel this bad forever. 1st shot was pretty normal, sleepy and maybe a few chills, arm soreness around injection site, fine after a day or two. 2nd shot reaction seemed normal at first, had the standard flu-like symptoms and injection site soreness, slept a lot, brain fog and headaches. 

Around the 4th day I started experiencing dizzy spells and vertigo that hasn't really gone away since. Pressure in my ears, still very fatigued, lots of brain fog. The vertigo isn't so bad that it makes me sick, but I've been pretty useless and can't do much or I feel like I might fall over. I try to stay sitting up most of the time to try to let my brain correct itself but it doesn't seem to get any better. I haven't been to the doctor because the pressure in my ears doesn't really hurt or feel like infection, so I've just been hoping the fluid or whatever is trapped in there will go away. I've tried ibuprofen, allergy medicine, and decongestant - the last one is the only thing that seems to have helped at all, but not enough to resolve it.

Just wondering if others are experiencing similar symptoms this far away from getting the shot. Everyone I know has been fine after a few days so I'm starting to worry that now I'm just stuck in this weird foggy, dizzy state. For what it's worth though, I'm still very much pro-vaccine and hope everyone gets theirs. I just also hope this resolves itself and I feel like myself again soon.",1620305090.0,2021-05-06 05:44:50

My 1st dose was April 6 about 915am.
Sore arm for about 2 days and brain fog for about 3 (that just went away).
My period was on time

My 2nd dose was May 4th (yesterday) about 915am.
I hydrated all day the day before and the day of.
Went to bed around 10pm feeling fine (I did have a sore arm) but woke up around 1130pm with chills (but also felt hot), joint pain, and a fever at 99. It wasn't too bad, very mild. I thought it'd be much worse. Took some advil and within 20 minutes the joint aches were gone and within another 10 minutes I had no fever or chills. I did have a hard time getting back to sleep. 
Woke up around 730 this morning and had a headache so took some more advil. Went for a walk and hung out at home. Around 1pm my joint pains started (VERY mild) took more advil and am fine.

Overall, very mild symptoms. 
Was super anxious so wanted to share for anyone else who is.",1620269251.0,2021-05-05 19:47:31

I thought I would share my experience with the covid vaccine, I spent a lot of time in this sub and there are a lot of posts of people having horrendous side effects. I am a 34 year old female, no major health problems, only that I receive vitamin B12 injections and my BMI is low. 

First dose on 4/6: minimal prepping, just had a sore arm and slept really hard the night of. Woke up the next morning feeling normal. I did have ‚Äúcovid arm‚Äù about 10 days after the shot, where my arm got sore again at the injection site but that only lasted a day-ish

Second dose on 5/4: I got my shot at 3 pm. I prepped more this time and drank a ton of water and pedialyte the day before and the day of. I also did the windmill with my arm directly after the shot while waiting the 15 minutes. I went home and drank more water and took Tylenol a couple hours later. I started to feel kind of run down around 9-10 pm. I went to bed but had a hard time falling asleep, I‚Äôm attributing the difficulty falling asleep to anxiety. I woke up at 4 am very restless with a low grade fever and body aches, mostly in my hips, legs, and neck. I had an increased heart rate, probably due to the fever; my resting pulse was ~95 bpm. I also had a decreased appetite. I couldn‚Äôt fall back to sleep so I got out of bed and drank more pedialyte and rested on the couch. I fell asleep for about an hour and woke up feeling better. I was able to eat and take more tylenol. It‚Äôs a little over 24 hours after my second dose and I feel pretty much back to normal, aside from my arm feeling sore. I‚Äôm feeling pretty tired but that‚Äôs probably because of the poor sleep last night. 

All in all, it wasn‚Äôt too terrible. I hope this was helpful!",1620272195.0,2021-05-05 20:36:35

First dose was a sore arm only. No noticeable side effects.

Second dose was relatively mild too. Had a sore arm immediately afterwards. Slept ok all night. Next morning had pretty obvious brain fog. Sore in the neck and most of my upper body. Sluggish all day, kinda felt like a mild hangover. I made sure to drink a ton of water and pedialyte before and after, which I think was key. I took a Tylenol before bed for the soreness. 

It‚Äôs been 48 hours since the shot. I woke up this morning feeling well rested. So far feeling energetic today. Still slightly sore. Took my dog for a walk, did some chores. 

I expected a lot more, so I prepped myself. If I didn‚Äôt know I had gotten the shot it would have seemed more like an ‚Äúoff‚Äù day. Fingers crossed that we‚Äôre done here.

I regularly take Kratom which is known to completely eliminate fevers and I took kratom every 2-3 hours today and I‚Äôm now feeling a lot better.

Never had covid and had a rough time with the first shot as well, but with the first shot it was more vertigo/anxiety/restlessness/nausea. With the second shot it just straight up feels like the flu but no mental side effects like no anxiety no restlessness no vertigo.


Update: so I felt sick about half of that first day after the shot, ever since then ive been fine! The second day after the shot I felt totally fine again and my arm even stopped hurting which amazed me bc the first shot I couldn‚Äôt move my arm for like a week.

"30 F- Second Dose, Mild Experience",1,n5xj3z,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n5xj3z/30_f_second_dose_mild_experience/,0,"**TLDR**- Pressure headache, body aches, tiredness, and low grade fever for 1 day. I would say my experience was pretty mild. Even the pains I had for the 2nd dose were not unbearable or anything. Absolutely worth getting the shot for! I have *severe* health anxiety and reading the posts here had me extremely nerved up. I would say my anxiety was, without question, the worst part of the experience.

Just to note, I‚Äôve never had COVID. 


**1st dose**- mild arm soreness (nothing worse than the flu shot), very slight rash at day 4 for a day or so and again at day 11. No other side effects



**2nd dose**- 


10:30AM- receive 2nd dose. Felt the needle with this one whereas I did not with the first. Also bled this time which is unusual for me. 


1PM- mildly sore arm, bruise and very very slight swelling at injection site already


8PM- no new side effects. I did have a random ear ache for a few minutes, not sure if it‚Äôs related. 


10PM- feeling more tired than I normally do at this time, but may just be from anxiety. Drinking a full pedialyte and heading to bed


5:30AM- wake up with a significant pressure headache and pressure in my ears. Feeling hot but no temp


7:30AM- wake up again and fever is 99.7 (my normal is 97.9), body aches have set in but I‚Äôd say are mild. Head pressure remains the same. Gonna drink some more water and pedialyte and hope for the best. No sweats and chills so far, fingers crossed


11AM- finally get out of bed but symptoms remain the same


1PM- not much of an appetite but I eat lunch. I cave and take 2 Tylenol and then head to lay down again


4PM- wake up, head still hurts and body aches still present but SIGNIFICANTLY better. Fever still the same


5PM- feeling really tired, fever still present, lay down again for 2 hours


7PM- headache is gone, body aches minimal


8:30PM- fever finally gone! Besides feeling unusually tired and still not having much appetite, I feel back to normal. Moderna rash still there, but it doesn‚Äôt really bother me besides an itch every so often


Next day- 100% back to normal save for the arm rash but that's no big deal",1620298422.0,2021-05-06 03:53:42

4/4 first dose - i didn't do any prep for my first shot but only experienced pain on the injection point, felt well and good otherwise

5/3 second dose - i did more prepping for this bc of other testimonies on this sub about the second dose (hydrated myself on water and pedialyte as early as 2 days prior, took tylenol after the shot, got plenty of sleep, ate an edible to calm my anxiety and put me to sleep faster, etc.), everyone in my family that received the second dose didn't experience any side effects besides the shoulder pain so i was banking on genetics to be on my side for this one. 

a few hours passed and i was still feeling fine, well enough to even go for a run that same day. 24 hours passed and i still felt fine other than the shoulder pain. apart from mild soreness on my legs, which idk if it was because of the shot or a combination to that and running, everything went great. 48 hours now and the soreness on my legs and shoulder are gone!

First dose my only symptom was an extremely sore arm with a bruise for the first 7 days. Days 8-14 I had the red dot that grew bigger each day, but faded in color as it grew. 
Period was on time, but I had heavy spotting 3 days before. Typically I have 24 hours of bad cramps when I start. This one was 72 hours. 

I'm 7 hours post 2nd dose. For the first 4 hours after injection I experienced the euphoria feeling in my head. It was wonderful. Lol. The good feeling has worn off. The soreness has started to set in at the injection site. I'm honestly just tired. It felt like a headache would creep in around the time the euphoria wore off, but nothing yet. I know I still have another 24 hours to possibly experience negative side effects so I'm trying to take it easy. I plan on taking a few Advil PM in a few hours before I head to bed for the evening.

It was a relatively easy decision for me to get the vaccine. I have 2 small children at home and my husband is a doctor who works with COVID patients (he is vaccinated) We live in Michigan where cases have been bad and the hospitals are full. I consider it such a privilege to get this vaccine! 

I suffer from very severe morning sickness, so I feel like I was definitely not in a great condition going into to getting the vaccine, but my doctor said I was safe to go ahead and get it.  

My first shot I was 5.5 weeks pregnant and the only side effect I had was a sore arm!

My second shot I was 9 weeks pregnant and really sick from my pregnancy. I got the shot on a Thursday afternoon and my husband took the next day off to help out in case I had a bad reaction, and boy was I glad he did! I woke up about 4 am with severe body aches and severe nausea. I basically couldn‚Äôt get out of bed, I was so cold and so hot all at the same time. I feel like if I would have been able to take ibuprofen it would have helped a lot, but I could only take Tylenol which helped a little. I was feeling rotten all day and became quite discouraged when at 5 p.m. I wasn‚Äôt feeling any improvement. Seeing the news and what is happening in India and around the world was a great reminder to me that I did the right thing. Luckily around 7 p.m. the chills and aches subsided and I was finally able to sleep that night like a rock. I felt a little tired the next day, but have had no other symptoms since.

I have not had an ultrasound since getting the vaccine, but my morning sickness is still very severe along with other pregnancy symptoms, and I feel quite sure my pregnancy is continuing along as normal. 

The decision to get the vaccine while pregnant is a very personal decision and I respect whatever choice a women makes for her circumstances. I just wanted to share my experience, and feel so grateful to be fully vaccinated!",1620193477.0,2021-05-04 22:44:37

37F - had both shots,29,n43ywl,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n43ywl/37f_had_both_shots/,5,"Hi everyone, just posting my experience even though it seems to be very typical. About me: 37 (almost 38) woman. I'm pretty active, fit, and healthy, non-smoker, very light drinker. I have a hormonal IUD and take an SSRI for anxiety/depression. I hydrated like crazy for a couple of days pre-shot, including electrolytes and probiotic drinks, and kept it up for a couple of days post-shot. 

Dose #1, 11:40 a.m.: VERY sore arm for the first night and next morning. Tylenol and, later, ibuprofen helped. I stupidly decided to work out that evening when I got home, because hey, that's what I do with a flu shot. I ended up having to really phone in the workout because I just didn't have my usual energy. I felt a bit run-down and tired for about three days, but nothing major (was still able to keep up with my preschooler all day). I got the Covid Arm rash on day 8 or 9 and it was red for nearly a week, but itching was very mild. It eventually faded into a lovely yellow bruise and then disappeared. I did notice that my depression and anxiety were worse for a period of about two weeks, beginning several days after the shot. I don't know if it's connected or not, but I've seen a few people mention similar experiences, so I figured it's worth noting.

Dose #2, Thursday 4/29, also at 11:40 a.m.: Like the first dose, my arm began to get sore about 3 hours after the shot, but I was able to work until 5:00 with no issues. I did go to bed around 8:00 because I was so sleepy, but I woke up at 10:00 and chatted with my husband for a bit. That was when the full-body aches and headache seemed to start. I had a fairly good night and woke up around 8:00 in the morning with a bad headache and feeling overall achy but otherwise okay. Even with Tylenol, the headache was bad enough that I had trouble watching or reading or even listening to anything, so I basically slept all day. By around 8:00 p.m. I was feeling much better. I felt about 90% on Saturday and 100% on Sunday. I got the Covid Arm rash on Friday this time, and it has been itchier than before but not horrible. It's still there, so we'll see how long this one lasts. 

100% worth it. I was never miserable, but I was VERY glad that I took the following day off work and that my kid was at childcare so I could rest.",1620096448.0,2021-05-03 19:47:28

1st shot: April 1st at 2:45pm. I felt a weird nerve sensation go down into my ulnar nerve in the arm I received the shot, but its nothing new because I injured that arm in jiu jitsu which caused nerve pain for months. It went away when within 5mins of receiving the shot. I had a sore arm later that night and next day, but was able to do push ups in my workout without much discomfort. It was mild and through the whole thing I had full range of motion in my arm.

2nd shot: April 29th at 2:50pm. I felt the needle go in, but did not experience the nerve sensation again. My arm was less sore than last time. I slept normal. By the 24hr mark I only noticed increased hunger and my under arm was sore if I pushed on it. I did notice my arm was itchy at the injection site area the next day, but there was no rash. 48hrs later my arm was slightly itchy, but still no rash. I did not experience any fever, tiredness, or nausea that I was definitely worried about.

First shot on the morning of Thursday April 1st.  No issues the first day at all.  I returned to work after getting the vaccine.  Woke Friday morning with a sore arm, nothing else remarkable.  Saturday was the same, with the additional feeling I equated to feeling ""high"" once in a while.  Sunday I woke feeling aches in my joints, then developed a low grade fever around noon.  Not horrible ... I mowed the grass, appetite was normal.  By Monday I was back to normal.

Second shot on the morning of Thursday April 29th.  Returned to work afterwards.  Arm started to get sore late afternoon.  Woke Friday morning to feeling strange, weakness in limbs, arm felt like I'd been hit with a baseball bat.  I went to work thinking I could power through ..... Made it two hours and came home.  Joints hurt, arm hurt, head hurt.  Slept from 9:30am to 1 pm.  Grabbed a very small lunch.  Still felt exhausted, back to bed 1:30pm to 4:30pm.  Woke with a 100.2 fever.  Popped a couple Tylenol, back to bed until about 6:30pm.  Felt better and way less pressure in my head, but tinnitus was more noticeable.  Had some dinner, then watched a movie.  In bed again by 9:00pm, slept until 6:30am Saturday.  Woke with a mild headache, but the tinnitus was much worse.  It slowly diminished over the morning, pretty much gone by noon.  Felt tired, but otherwise fine by Saturday night.

I didn't do anything out of the ordinary.  Kept myself well hydrated, ate when hungry.  I'm pretty fit for my age with no major health issues.

Curious to see if anyone else had any tinnitus issues.  I've always had it (too many years of loud music and power tools) but Saturday morning it was extremely loud in my head.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it!

I got my first Moderna vaccine jab Friday (04/30) and I had muscle soreness in my shoulder Saturday and Sunday, with one day the muscle soreness being so bad I could not sleep on my left side/shoulder. (I sleep on my sides)

Today the muscle soreness is like 99% gone, I go pee and my urine burns, with the burn lasting for about an hour or two after I peed.

I read that burning urination was an rare side effect of the pfizer vaccine (one individual in one study, about .4% of the population), is this also a side-effect of the moderna vaccine.

I am a 23 year old male, I live at home with my family, we all eat the same stuff and none of their piss is burning, so it's not the food. I've not seen anyone so it's not a STD.

Hopefully this is a relevant question I can ask on here. It is not actually for me, but for a friend who has tried to reach out to their doctor's office, the CDC, and CVS but did not get a straight answer. So, why not try Reddit for the heck of it?

The situation is that they just got the 1st dose on April 30th, but they are scheduled to leave the US to go to Sweden on May 19. Obviously this is before the 24-28 days needed to get the 2nd shot, but they were trying to see if they could get it early. If not, they wouldn't be able to get it in a reasonable time because they will be coming back to the US until August. 

I figure because the flights were finalized before they were able to schedule receiving their 1st and 2nd dose of the vaccine, that they will probably just end up not getting the second dose. From what my friend said, Sweden does not have any mandatory vaccine status to enter the country; they just need a negative COVID result no older than 48 hours from arriving. However, I am not sure if they would be able to *eventually* get the second dose so they can have the ""fully vaccinated"" status.",1620113498.0,2021-05-04 00:31:38

4/30 second dose:  shot stung noticeably more than the first.  I took Tylenol beforehand.  I know they say not to, but I really don‚Äôt care.  I think it helped a lot.  Nothing really happened until close to 12 hours when sore arm set in.  Took more Tylenol.  Body ached very mildly. Woke up feeling pretty good.  Took preventative Tylenol.  Around the 20 hour mark, I had some more body aches for about an hour and a half.  Took more Tylenol.  Arm pain mild.  Arm pit on arm that received the shot is slightly swollen.  Same thing happened with first shot.  That‚Äôs about it.  I was able to be out and about, normal, without issues.  I was horribly anxious about this second shot, and it was all for nothing.

I read a lot of posts over the last 24 hours and I was pretty frightened but happy to share I've had a decent go with the Moderna vax. 

To start, I had my first dose about 4 weeks ago. My arm was extremely sore and I was pretty tired. I got the vaccine around 2PM and went to bed at like 7PM (super early for me) and was fine the next day.

I received my second dose yesterday at 5:45 PM and I was bracing for the worst. I've read the second dose is rough on healthy, younger folks. I am a fairly avid runner (approx. 50 miles / week) and eat healthy/clean - I am a vegetarian. I am 26 hours out from the second dose and I feel 100% fine. My stomach felt a little bit funny in the morning, but I'm honestly not sure if that was just in my head. My energy levels have felt great and I haven't experienced any of the body ache/flu symptoms that I have read about.

I'm kind of floored the experience has been this easy and I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. But for now, I feel great. I am knocking on wood this continues. 

I wanted to share because I've read that Moderna will knock you on your ass if you are healthy and I feel like I fit the mold of that description. And I haven't had that experience at all. I'm very curious for studies to be published on reactions to the vaccine to better understand why some folks get crushed by this, while others do not.

Saturday I felt some fatigue and then nausea, followed by muscle aches and a metallic taste in my mouth. That afternoon I began having issues breathing and had to use my (asthma) inhaler more than a few times. I also had some hives around my left elbow. The pollen count was really high so could have been pollen allergies. 

Saturday evening I noticed my sense of taste was dulled and muscle aches worsened. Temperature stayed around 101, cold sweats, flushed face. Fatigue and muscle aches persisted, felt like the flu. 

Symptoms began to improve today (Sunday). Temperature is around 100 with fever reducers. I think I'll mostly be back to normal tomorrow. Side effects sucked more than expected, but still glad I got it. 2nd dose scheduled for 5/28.

I took this hour by hour, stayed in bed when I didn't feel good, and made sure I had someone around to take care of me. I also hydrated well afterwards.

4/30 @ 5pm - 2nd vaccine 


10pm - Normal, feeling very very slight (almost not noticeable) ache in head. Overall very tired from work - nothing out of the ordinary here. Arm is a little sore. 


5/1 @ 8am - Slept average, woke up now feeling more tired than usual. Arm is very sore - more so than the first shot. Very slight sinus headache. No other symptoms. Can kind of tell my body is getting ready to fight something.


9:30 am - Fell back to sleep and woke up now, definitely feeling tired and off. Left side of head has sinus type headache. About to get up and get some water and pedialyte, take temp, eat, and chill downstairs until my next nap. No fever at this point but definitely feeling off. 


11:00 am - No fever. Cold, tired, minor headache. Went back to bed. Don't feel like I need Advil yet. Generally just feeling down.


1pm - headache worsening, feels like a bad sinus headache, still holding off on pain killers. Trying to nap but can't. Cold but face is hot!
Crying?!! Why am I crying? I'm blaming my period. 


2:45pm - 99.3 temp. Headache a little worse but that's expected. Super hungry, eating lunch but one peanut butter sandwich is more than enough. Appetite definitely reduced but no nausea or gastrointestinal issues. 


5pm - Exactly 24 hours post vaccine, just woke up from a nap after lunch. 99.3. Headache still persists but I do not have chills anymore. Arm is noticeably less sore than 2 hours ago?


6pm - 101 temp and feeling hot, teeth start to hurt, finally take Advil. Since chills are gone I come out from the covers and woah baby - HOT!


7:30pm - Temp still around 100, hot and sweaty. Advil knocked the headache out! Teeth still hurt. Hungry but no appetite, snacked on some cheese and pretzels from lunch. Kind of want ice cream :P


11pm - 98.1 no fever as of now, slight headache, tired and ready for bed 


5/2 @ 4:30am - woke up from tossing and turning, tired but can't get comfortable and back hurts from laying so much. No headache! I feel fairly normal; not going to check temp. Teeth still hurt a little. 


11am - 97.7; back to normal! Still a little tired though.",1620000948.0,2021-05-02 17:15:48

But- to start: My friends come from all political walks, and some are excited about taking the vaccine and others are the opposite. 

In this past December and January, I was hesitant about taking any new vaccine which was rushed to market etc etc. we all were unsure about what was coming. I‚Äôm not on socials, but I noticed a trend developing, where my friends who weren‚Äôt taking the vaccine- judged those who did. And my friends who took the vaccine, judged those who didn‚Äôt. And both groups feel no awkwardness asking you (and everyone) point blank about their vaccine status. 

Brief backstory of myself- shitty immune system. Have taken vitamins religiously, had strep all the time as a kid and surprisingly many times as an adult. If I didn‚Äôt get the flu shot, I‚Äôd be in bed 3 weeks every winter, without fail. During the entire Covid situation, I got very sick- plenty of times‚Ä¶ but tested negative for Covid over and over again.  And my idea of adding another vaccine in my body was not appealing to me, because I was very worried about the side effects. 

Fast forward. I got the moderna vaccine a few weeks ago. I didn‚Äôt really tell anyone, I didn‚Äôt make it a think, I just did it. I felt a little weird but mainly it felt like someone took a hacksaw to my left shoulder for 1.5 days. I couldn‚Äôt even sleep on that side. 

But fast forward to today, and I KNOW this is too early to tell anything substantive. But, I feel better than ever. Like my immune system feels better than I‚Äôve ever remembered it feeling. Usually, if I miss sleep, or vape a lot- I can notice the usual pains and aches associated with an oncoming fever and feeling like shit a day or two. But this is different, I can vape more than I‚Äôve ever vaped, not get a lot of sleep and I feel fucking outstanding. Granted, I‚Äôm not trying to live this way- but this past week has been stressful. I have more energy, am more excited to just get things done and am eating markedly less. Since the vaccine I‚Äôve lost 8 lbs because I‚Äôve also decided to start running everyday, because I feel so good. 

I want to tell everyone to get this shot, but I will be looked at as some shill who is paid or full of shit. I don‚Äôt know. Just my two cents- I get my second shot in a few weeks. But whatever was in that first shot- my immunity has never felt this ironclad in 35 years. Thanks!!!",1619927816.0,2021-05-01 20:56:56

First thing we felt was serious relief! 

My symptoms 
2:30pm - shot

~10:30pm- felt off, can't really describe it. Skin felt sensitive to the touch (I always get like this with the flu and colds) and I felt cold but was warm to the touch.

~12:30am- woke up feeling TERRIBLE. Horrible body aches, mild nausea, mostly I had what must have been brain fog, but it was unlike anything I've experienced. I had vertigo, I felt paranoid and like I was going crazy. I chalked it up to being a panic attack and fatigue and finally fell back to sleep after an hour or so. I think I took a Tylenol at this point (pre-sleep) but can't remember.

Next day I had severe body aches, I couldn't stop shaking, I felt like I was burning up (but had no fever). I took 3 extra strength Tylenol throughout the entire day to make things more bearable. I had to work but fortunately was just messing around on my laptop, only had one 30 minute meeting.

The following day I felt physically tired but otherwise fine, and that was the last of my symptoms. I had Moderna arm after my first shot but not this time (already over 2 weeks out). 


My wife's symptoms
2:30pm - shot

6:30pm - started feeling really tired. She slept through the night except when I woke up.

The following day she was physically exhausted and didn't have much of an appetite. 

That night, leading into the 2nd day post-shot, she got very nauseous and felt moderately to severely nauseous for about 12 hours and then queasy for about 12 more hours. She was really gassy and having diarrhea as well.

Day 3 post shot for her was back to not much appetite + a little queasy. She had no body aches, headache, chills, or fever at any point.

Lymph node pain--help!,4,n2q4mq,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n2q4mq/lymph_node_painhelp/,3,"(30 f)
First off, I have a ridiculously sensitive/reactive body. A flu shot put me out for a whole day with high fever and flu-like symptoms and lymph node pain on the side of the injection for like a week.

The first dose of Moderna gave me body aches for a day and led me to discover the location of a bunch of lymph nodes that I didn't know about because they hurt. This didn't fully go away. My doctor didn't find anything wrong, just an unpleasant, albeit not terribly concerning reaction to the vaccine.

I'm now four days out from my second dose. I have to keep my elbows glued to my sides or I get fiery, stabbing pains that seemed to originate in the lymph nodes nearest my armpits and breasts. My breasts hurt. My nipples hurt. I didn't know my nipples could feel like this. 

I've tried OTC pain relievers and anti-inflammatories, but nothing seems to be helping. This is greatly interfering with my ability to live and work. 

I've seen plenty of posts about lymph node swelling, but I haven't found any that speak to pain and pain management. Any tips? Please and thank you!",1619928022.0,2021-05-01 21:00:22

nothing, literally nothing just arm pain. it even worries me a little not feeling anything because i‚Äôve heard that is actually a good sign to get those side effects but everyone is different i guess.

Only side effects from the first shot were a very painful arm, waves of intense fatigue for about a week but that would occur a few times over the following 3 weeks, and a general loss of appetite and aversion to certain foods for about 2 weeks. When i got the actual shot i couldn‚Äôt feel it at all.

2nd shot: I got it at 7 PM on Thursday 4/29. I didn‚Äôt eat much that day but did have some drinks before and after the shot (about 3 total). The shot hurt going in, but just felt like a normal shot.

3 hours post shot: both arms start hurting with shooting aches. I take 3 ibuprofen and go to bed.

8 hours post shot: I wake up at 3 AM mostly just feeling hungover. Cannot go back to sleep. The ‚Äúhangover‚Äù gets worse over the next few hours with mild body aches setting in.

12 hours post shot: it‚Äôs 7 AM and the fever and body aches have completely set in and really ramped up pretty quickly. i run usually at about 96.5 and i have a 99.3 fever. cannot get comfortable, just end up writhing around.

13 hours post shot: i feel extremely sick and nauseous. I eat a banana to take more ibuprofen. i throw it up about 45 minutes later. 

14 hours post shot: the vomiting didn‚Äôt seem to evacuate the ibuprofen because i feel a LOT better and order some soup, which makes me feel better but not for long. it‚Äôs about 9 am at this point and i try to go back to sleep.

Hours 15-22: i feel pretty much sicker than i have ever felt in my life. i cannot sleep. i throw up 2 more times (like in sessions, probably about 10 individual times over the whole day), and fever gets up to 100. i can‚Äôt even look at my phone or watch tv. i lay in silence until i can force down a banana at 3 and take tylenol. i finally fall asleep and sleep until 5. 

Hours 16-27: i wake up feeling slightly better. i order some pho but can‚Äôt really eat it. i lay back down and start to feel sicker. my fever reaches its highest point of 100.5 at around hour 24/25 (7/8 PM) and lasts until i take 3 ibuprofen at 9:30PM. This is the turning point. 

Hours 27-31: I sleep from about 10 till 2 AM, when i wake up feeling MUCH better. fever down to 97.7. 

Hours 31-39: I somehow sleep again until 10 AM. i wake up feeling a lot better! Can‚Äôt even believe how badly i felt yesterday. I have a headache and feel fatigued but it feels very manageable.

The vomiting and long lasting fever definitely freaked me out and were symptoms I was completely unprepared for. I feel that if I didn‚Äôt cycle with the ibuprofen and tylenol I would not have been able to deal and might‚Äôve gone to the hospital because I think I would‚Äôve kept throwing up and not sleeping. I was warned that symptoms peak at hour 12; for me, that‚Äôs when they started, and everything really peaked from hours 15-27. Then the ‚Äúflu‚Äù basically went away as quickly as it came on.

Update 5/18 (menstrual stuff) - currently have my period, have been bleeding for 10 days. 5 days in it got ‚Äúreal‚Äù with bad cramps and heavy heavy bleeding. before then i was having spotting and cramps that would turn into diarrhea. appetite is fine but have not gone a day without loose stool since the shot (it‚Äôs not so bad that i‚Äôm losing weight). it seems like the experience really messed with my hormones, which messed with my period and intestines.",1619908821.0,2021-05-01 15:40:21

Shot #2 - Apr 29th:

 - 3pm - Felt the poke this time. Arm tingled again for a few minutes. Arm started getting sore about two hours after vax. Been drinking a lot of Gatorade.

 - 9pm - 6 hours post vax and it feels like somebody stabbed me in the arm with a butter knife. Took two Advil for the soreness.

 - 2am - 11 hours post #2 and no noticeable symptoms yet other than being tired, but I work 3rd shift and I don't get good enough sleep anyway. Just sittin around being nervous. Should probably just go lay down.

 - 6am - wake up with a light headache and my skin feels irritated. Fall back to sleep

 - 10am - wake up to make the kids breakfast. Headache is much worse. Arm obviously still sore. Fever at 99.5 ( I'm never over 98.3). Skin still feels raw. Feel a lot more fatigued than usual. Take 1 tylenol. I'm hungry but nervous to eat. Drink a glass of watered down gatorade. Lay back down at 11am. Kids start arguing about Luigi's Mansion 3, get up to handle it......back to bed.

 - 2pm - woke up, fever is gone but headache is still pretty brutal and it's right behind my eyes. A little light- sensitive. Skin doesn't feel as raw. Still fatigued, but nothing some food and caffeine wouldn't fix. Haven't eaten in 24 hours. Was afraid of throwing up, but no nausea so far. I'd go about my regular day if I could snuff out this headache.

 - 5pm - 26 hours after 2nd dose, headache still lingers but not nearly as bad. Feel good enough to get some things done around the house. Need to eat.

 - 8pm - worked outside for a bit then had dinner. Feel decent. Still a very mild lingering headache and I feel like I could just sit on the couch and be lazy. No more fever. Skin no longer feels irritated.

 - midnight - 33 hours post vax....I feel as normal as usual. Still a slight ache behind my right eye. Off to bed.

 - next morning (May 1st) woke feeling refreshed and back to normal, no headache....only to find out on facebook that a friend of mine, un-vaccinated, same age, is in the hospital with Covid. Damn.

First Dose of Moderna (5 months after having Covid-19),1,n2p14w,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n2p14w/first_dose_of_moderna_5_months_after_having/,5,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to provide an update on my experience with the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, yesterday 4/31/21, and was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, differences, etc? As I mentioned, I had Covid over Thanksgiving, so late November. It was miserable. It is obviously considered a mild case because I did not require supplemental oxygen, nor was I hospitalized, but nonetheless, it was awful. However, I feel it is disrespectful to complain about it, given the fact that 3.18 million people around the world have died from Covid/Covid related complications.  I got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine and have felt sooooo shitty since 8 pm last night. Got shot at 11:30 am. Fever, chills, body aches, sore arm, G.I. distress, fatigue, and some. My question is if anyone has also had a bad reaction after the first shot after having had covid previously, and was also wondering if it's likely I'll feel much worse after the second shot a month from now. I have done some reading and it makes sense as to why I'm having nasty side effects after the first shot because my body recognizes the virus and is doing its job building more antibodies, etc. Anyway, I figured I would just share my experience. I will certainly be getting the second shot because I do want to have full immunity to not only protect myself but be less likely to transmit it to others. I hope everyone is doing as well as one can be during these trying times, though I do indeed see light at the end of the tunnel.",1619924868.0,2021-05-01 20:07:48
Moderna Shot (1 &2 completed). - Did anyone else get hit hard two week after 2nd shot?,50,n23y84,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n23y84/moderna_shot_1_2_completed_did_anyone_else_get/,24,"I was lucky to get the Moderna vaccine in early March and my second almost a month later.   After the second shot I had all the feelings most people do. Like a rolling storm taking over your body for 12 hours - chills, fever, fatigue, dry mouth, headache, etc.  A unique experience, but one that most had talked about in those early days.  After that window of time, I was back to normal, and super excited to be fully vax'd.

Just over two weeks later I woke up last Friday morning unable to get out of bed.  At first I thought I had mild depression, which in itself is unusual but couldn't figure out what the flat energy was. As the day progressed I felt worse, making me realize it was progressing and was likely a form of fatigue.

Long story short my symptoms became worse over the next 48 hours (fatigue, body pain, chills  that came and went, stomach churn, tigher breathing (like end of day at beach when you breath in and it kind of hurts) etc.., but no headache, thankfully).  Like the worse flu I had ever had.  On Sunday afternoon I went to urgent care at a friend's suggestion. They thought maybe I had Covid and didn't realize it.  After all, I had zero reference for symptoms this far removed from those first 24 hours after the 2nd shot.

Urgent care was fantastic.  They did the rapid and the two day test.  Fortunately, both came back negative.    The attending Doctor said that I likely had a further reaction to the 2nd shot as they are still collecting data given how new this all is.  He had other come in with similar experiences, which was super helpful to know.   I felt much better (mentally) after going to Urgent Care and speaking to someone who wasn't alarmed by my situation.  I still felt horrible thru Monday, but I had a better sense of what the cause likely was and that put my mind to rest.  The doctor told me I wasn't contagious so didn't need to isolate.  Just rest up, drink liquids and know that it's a sign that your immunity is building itself up.

It's now the following Friday (Monday was my last rough day) and I'm completely fine.  In fact, I'm feeling so thankful to be well and clear-headed once again.  That's why I'm writing this.  I had felt very alone and a bit scared those first 2.5 days.   Don't want anyone to feel that way.

Just in case you find yourself in the same situation, it's possible to have further reactions to the Moderna shot beyond that initial 24 hour period.  Don't be scared and do go to urgent care on the 2nd or 3rd day should you need to (and do ask for the covid test, just to be sure).

Happy to answer questions as time permits.

Wishing everyone health, wellness and happiness.",1619847100.0,2021-04-30 22:31:40

I had been told that because I've had food allergy reactions before (on occasion bananas and eggs make my mouth itch) I had to be monitored for 30 minutes - and my reaction to the vaccine had made it so I would sit closer to the hospital workers so I could be monitored a bit more closely.

I felt okay enough at the thirty minute mark to go home.

It has been approximately 17 hours since my vaccine, and my symptoms are as follows:

‚Ä¢ extreme body aches (though I do have fibromyalgia but this feels more like a flare.)
‚Ä¢ itchiness (my face! so weird....)
‚Ä¢ upset stomach
‚Ä¢ tiredness (I slept like crud last night so that's probably why.)
‚Ä¢ sore arm (of course.)

I was also a tad dizzy and disoriented when I woke up but it has improved as time went on.

I am also on Day 2 of my menstrual cycle so I wonder if a lot of what I am feeling is contributed to that as well as the vaccine.

My second dose is the end of May. . .and I wonder if the side effects will be greater than this üò¨ Not looking forward to it, if so.

I had my second shot yesterday (4/29) around 5PM and my arm hurts worse than any pain I‚Äôve felt before including childbirth, labor, appendicitis, kidney stones, broken bones. My body aches are TERRIBLE even when my fever breaks... Every single movement today brought me to tears which is very unlike me. 
I started drinking about 2 gallons of water a day three days before my shot since I felt pretty bad after my first one. Ive been rotating Tylenol and Advil since I started feeling the pain but haven‚Äôt felt any relief except for my fever breaking.

Background: I am 26, male, healthy, & in shape. I had covid in March 2020 (worked in medical field) and had a week of moderate symptoms. Mainly extreme fatigue, low fever (only first 2 days), headache, back pain, leg numbness, & loss of taste and smell. 

First dose: Tired. The next day I slept off and on all day; I had no energy to focus on work. Overall, I didn‚Äôt feel bad, just fatigued. 

Second dose: I received the injection at 12pm, by 9pm I began feeling warm. Long night of no sleep, feeling hot, yet having chills, and waking up multiple times to chug water. During the day, I felt like the first day I had covid (which wasn‚Äôt the worst day for me); I felt extremely tired and had a dull yet consistent headache. Again, I slept most of the day, but this time I generally did not feel well. Thankfully, the symptoms resolved by the end of the day and I am doing well!

For our first shots we were both fatigued and of course had arm soreness around the injection site.

Before the appointment, both of us drank one packet of liquid IV hydration.  This is a name brand but I'm sure other electrolyte brands do the same job.  It was recommended by a friend to us and so we bought a box to share.

We both did these exercises right after the shot, per someone else here's recommendation: [https://www.shelteringarms.com/arm-soreness-after-covid-19-vaccination/](https://www.shelteringarms.com/arm-soreness-after-covid-19-vaccination/) We did them right there in the pharmacy while waiting that grace period after the shot. The arm pain we experienced this time around was definitely less than with the first shot.  I have almost no pain at all there today.

We went home and I drank another two packets of that stuff with plenty of water in between them.  My husband had three packets.  We both drank lots of water overnight also (I measured 4 cups for myself), and I still felt pretty dehydrated by morning.

The next day (Wednesday) my husband woke up with a 100.4 fever which went down shortly after getting out of bed and popping a Tylenol.  I had a headache and nausea throughout the day.  No fever for me.  We drank another four packets (this time CVS brand because my mom couldn't find the liquid IV stuff there), plus lots of water.  My husband had some muscle soreness and headache also, and he fell right to sleep at bedtime (not unusual).

The next day (Thursday) we both felt 99% better.  I had a slight headache near my right temple most of the day which kind of came and went.  We both went to work.

Today (Friday) we are 100%.  Both of us worked out this morning, no issues.  We both think the hydration saved us.  My husband wants to start making hydration packets/tabs a thing in his life because he says he feels better than ever with all this hydration.

I got my period the morning of our second shot and it stopped it by the next day.  The second day of my period is usually the heaviest and most painful - I had nothing.  It came back slightly the next day but not enough to need a sanitary product.  Same thing today.

I feel it was worth it, because now I can get back to my life and livelihood, which relies on me leaving the house.

First moderna received Saturday, 3/27, left arm:

- approx 4hrs after my shot, I felt a little lightheaded and was hit with a big feeling of fatigue. Slept like a log for an hour and felt better. Carried on with my day. Arm was sore, but not awful.

- 8 days post vaxx #1, woke up with a giant red rash around the vaccination site. Didn‚Äôt make any connection! That evening- noticed it was much bigger. (Ever notice when something is wrong with you, you suddenly become an the worlds best online researcher? Well, that‚Äôs when I discovered I had the ‚ÄúCovid arm‚Äù rash. It was super red and large with a slight itch. Day 3, lighter pink/no itch. Fully gone by day 5.)

Second Moderna shot, Saturday 4/24, (given that I had the rash with the fist shot, opted to get my right arm done this time):

- A few hours after receiving the shot, I had a pretty intense headache and felt very spaced out. Later that evening, I started feeling chilly and ‚Äúoff‚Äù. My arm- HOLY TOLEDO!! The pain was like I got punched in the arm!! It was crazy sore! 
- I was very achy with chills most of the evening and overnight. I woke to a fever of 100.4¬∞F. Fortunately it was a Sunday so I rested the entire day‚Äî but I felt absolutely lousy. Fever broke early afternoon. 
- around 7 PM I was feeling better! Yay!

Day 2 post #2 vaccination:
- still was not feeling 100%. Felt feverish with chills in the morning. Managed to get through my workday (fortunately working from home) but had to take a couple of naps.
- more concerning, I had an extreme dizzy spell around 11 AM seemingly out of nowhere! Took meclizine to help combat the feeling. I had another intense near-fainting spell that evening around 6 PM. Guess the meclizine didn‚Äôt do its thing :-/   Slowly sipped cool water, ate dinner and felt better.
- I also had developed another rash- no pain or itch, but it was quite large! And all around the vaccination area.

Day 3 post #2 vaccination:
- felt markedly better! Still had the rash, and it spread to the inside of my arm but didn‚Äôt bother me. Not itchy, not raised just kind of ‚Ä¶ there.

I‚Äôm now almost one week into being nearly fully vaccinated. And even though I felt lousy, it beats getting the virus. My rash has now faded. I‚Äôm really happy to have received both shots! 

The only other thing I wanted to note is that since receiving my first vaccine, I‚Äôve noticed that many of my joints often ache. I‚Äôm active and healthy, but have noticed more pains in my joints since receiving my vaccinations. Related? I can‚Äôt be sure.

That day, and the following, I felt relatively fine, just a little tired and agitated. On Wednesday is when I started to feel like crap. I had diarrhea in the morning, followed by strange waves of feeling totally fine and then out of nowhere, I'd suddenly feel awful. Hands and feet sweating, heart racing, shaking, dilated pupils all day, and a very odd sensation inside and outside my nose which caused shortness of breath, and my veins seemed to pop out more, plus my fingers would have a blueish tinge to them while this 'wave' was happening. Yesterday, I still had the swollen/numb nostril sensation after I woke up, but it mysteriously went away a few hours later and hasn't come back since.

The nose sensation is the thing causing me a lot of anxiety. It isn't listed as a side effect at all and I can't describe exactly why it was so weird. It felt like nothing I've felt before. Like I was congested inside/my passages were swollen, but no runny nose, and the outsides just felt... numb? Swollen? It was so weird.

1st Dose | 28 Male,5,n1ydea,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n1ydea/1st_dose_28_male/,0,"I received my first dose on the 28th and initially on the drive home I started to get real tired . After about 30 minutes my injection arm starts to get a little sore but nothing crazy . Almost a hour after my shot little things like walking around the house or just standing up made my head feel even more tired . It was almost as if I could feel my body working so hard to try and adjust to what I was just given . Most of my family members received Pfizer ( no side effects ) but it wasn‚Äôt available for me .    Once hour 3 hit I was so tired and groggy during the middle of the day.  My arm was completely sore by that point but barely any visible redness . 

The next day I felt barely any energy for work or the gym. There was zero ‚Äúreal pain‚Äù for me during these last two days . Only the feeling of being constantly drowsy and want to go back to sleep.

I will update on ‚ÄúDose 2‚Äù soon",1619831161.0,2021-04-30 18:06:01

* 3-4 hours after, I started to feel fatigued. I took some Tylenol and and eventually went to sleep
* Didn't sleep well at all, kept waking up every few hours (no fever); noticed my arm pain setting in, but not as bad as the first shot
* Woke up feeling very tired and my muscles, esp. my upper back, were achy; temp was 99.4
* By mid-morning (19 hours after my shot), I developed a fever of 100.1 so I took some Tylenol and napped for about 2 hours
* The rest of the day I just felt tired and achy, with my fever going away and coming back periodically. Didn't experience any chills, which was nice
* When I went to bed, I got another horrible night's sleep

Today, 2 days after, I feel generally fine. Arm is still slightly sore. My temp rose to 99.5 around 12pm and I have a swollen lymph node in my armpit on the same side I got the shot. Going to grab dinner with a friend tonight, so I'm essentially back to normal. 

Some things I believe helped:

* Drank lots of water the day of, especially 1 hour before my shot. Stayed hydrated afterwards and the next day
* Did some arm exercises for the first hour after. I saw someone in the waiting area doing this, so I did it too
* Preemptively took off work the next day. I'm glad I was able to do this, even though I didn't feel super sick I wouldn't have been able to stare at my computer all day
* Had some meals prepped ahead of time",1619830504.0,2021-04-30 17:55:04

This is my experience (so far) with the moderna vaccine. I got it about 24 hours ago and the side effects started hitting me around an hour post shot, with the growing headache being the only side effect then. I got ridiculously exhausted about 2 hours after, fortunately I was home and done driving so I passed the hell out. Woke up no more than 2 hours later feeling all out of whack, I felt feverish (but didn't take my temp), what was a slight headache was now pretty prominent pain in my temples, couldn't stop shivering and felt very cold. I took a Tylenol and ate some fish and chips (debatably a bad call) and drank about 40 oz of water. About 45 mins to an hour after that the headache subsided, energy returned to me and the only side effect left was my sore arm, which was a little uncomfortable for sleeping but today the pain is a 1-2 out of 10 in my arm. 
Right after getting the shot I started reading some other peoples experiences with the moderna vax and a few of them were somewhat anxiety inducing, so after my experience I decided to post one that wasn't so eventful to reassure anyone who hasn't gotten the first shot yet that there's a chance you'll be aok.

Itchy swollen veins in the opposite arm,2,n1g129,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n1g129/itchy_swollen_veins_in_the_opposite_arm/,4,"I had kind of a weird reaction to my Moderna shot yesterday. I had an issue about 4 hours after my second shot. Shot was in the right arm, but the veins in my left wrist started feeling itchy and suddenly they were protruding like I'd broken or bruised one. The itchy feeling progressed to visably large swollen and itchy veins throughout my entire left forearm. 

It's like my firearm was hulking out for lack of a better description. 

The itchiness and swelling went away in a couple of hours, but I was beginning to feel anxious about having a possible blood clot in my wrist or something. I'm fine today, just really tired and lacking energy and my shot site is a bit sore. 

10/10 I'd still do it all over again to be 95% immunized and not ever get full blown Coronavirus and possibly die from it.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I put an icy hot patch on my arm and my body is just sore. I took 2 naproxen and 2 acetaminophen with my coffee.

I've been awake about 2 hours and the meds have kicked in. I only have the slightest headache.

Let me be clear though, you guys. I don't take such good care of myself so I almost always wake up feeling shitty, so who know how much of today's shityness are because of the vaccine lol

We got our first doses March 25 and the second dose the 22nd. The first dose was just a sore arm for about 2 days. No biggie. I was prepared for the second dose to be hell, especially after reading most people's reactions to it. It was fine for the first few hours, then the arm started hurting. On that first night I got the chills for a bit, low fever, some hot flashes here and there, slight headache, a few minutes of dizziness. It sounds worse than it actually was, it was all pretty minimal. I just relaxed and took some Tylenol. I accidentally slept on my shot arm and it magically didn't hurt much after I woke up, except the spot of the shot was tender to touch for a few days. Second day I was pretty much ok, I've felt worse from sinus infections.

My husband had it bad. He had the same symptoms as I did just heightened. He was sweating most of the night but shivering, his fever lasted much longer than mine, he couldn't stay awake for more than 30 minutes at a time, nauseous, dizzy, migraine. His symptoms lasted two days. I kept him on Tylenol the whole time. Thankfully he's ok now. I attribute it to having a better immune system than he does, he was pretty sickly as a kid. Regardless, he says he doesn't regret it and neither do I. Just the peace of mind we have now that we are vaccinated was worth a few days discomfort.",1619734878.0,2021-04-29 15:21:18

Props to CVS as they were very organized. Even got an e-mail within five minutes noting I have had two doses, lot #s, dates, who did the injection, and other info like that.  I downloaded it and will keep a copy and provide a copy to my PCP.

Developed a slightly sore around about six hours later but not like the first shot.  Woke up around 4:30 and the arm was much more sore.  Got up, had a bite to eat and took two Advil and within an hour the soreness was much better.  Able to get back asleep  (with the usual weird dreams).

Now almost 18 hours later, slightly sore arm but (so far!), that's it.  I'll take it easy today with a few more Advil and drink water.

I really drank a lot of water yesterday; did it help?  Don't have any idea but what could it hurt.

Second shot was way less unpleasant than I expected,28,n0vhuw,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/n0vhuw/second_shot_was_way_less_unpleasant_than_i/,6,"28M, got second shot Sunday afternoon around 4:30. Drank about a gallon of water, did some free weights to try to reduce arm soreness, went for a run, had dinner, did some other chores. Around 10 or 11 I started feeling a little tired and feverish. I went to bed and was definitely running a fever overnight, and as a result felt kind of restless and slept very poorly.
  
Woke up Monday morning feeling lethargic and still somewhat feverish. I took my dog for a walk around the block and that felt pretty taxing. Ate breakfast, took some Advil, and went back to bed. My fever went away in a couple of hours and I started feeling generally better, just tired. I watched a movie and took a nap, and then took my dog for a longer walk, about an hour, which felt fine. I felt a little more energetic in the evening and made a nice dinner even though I had prepped a bunch of soup. At one point I thought I might be getting a headache but I took more Advil and that kept it at bay. I went to bed early, took a Nyquil just to be safe, and slept easily.  

Tuesday I felt fine, just a sore arm. Wednesday (today) I feel great, and my arm isn't even sore any more.

I feel like a lot of people are saying ""the second shot may suck but it's not as bad as COVID"". That's true, but in my experience it wasn't even as bad as, like, a regular cold. I know some people have a harder time of it and I don't want to diminish their experiences, but I want people to be aware that there's a wide range and many cases go pretty smoothly.

If you're worried about side effects and hoping to get an outcome like mine, I'd advise doing pushups or pullups or weights rather than just windmills to reduce arm soreness, drinking as much water as you can, and using OTC medication liberally to control symptoms. In particular, I think if I had taken some meds on Sunday night when I first felt the fever coming on, I might have slept better and had an even milder experience the next day.

Good luck!",1619694456.0,2021-04-29 04:07:36

I'm mid-40s, female, non-smoker, runner.

Shot 1, left arm: sore arm for four days, a week later visible and painful swollen lymph nodes in the armpit and some mild diarrhea

Shot 2, right arm: Slow onset of arm soreness and moderate swelling of lymph nodes, but now my face itched too (especially my eyelids). Within nine hours I started getting chills, fever, and body aches and so I went to bed. Very manageable, but I awoke in the middle of the night gasping for air and noticed I was wheezing (mild allergic reaction?), so I slept sitting up for the next hour. By mid-morning, fever had broken and only returned intermittently over the next 24 hours, body aches lasted through the day, and I had shortness of breath. The next day I was just tired, but otherwise felt fine.

So this is where it takes a turn, on the third day after getting my shot my energy was good and I decided to take a 5k run.  During the run, my muscles felt fine but I just could not get my lungs to open enough for deep breathing, and the shallow breathing pushed by heart rate too high. I ended up barely eking out 2.5 torturous miles before I felt like I would either vomit or faint. Walked the rest of the way. That night, I had the worst allergy attack I've had in years (ever?), almost like the vaccine sent my immune system into overdrive. It wasn't a particularly bad day for pollen (3/5) and I was well hydrated.

It's been a month now, and I still can't run a 5k without walking parts of it to bring my heart rate back down, still shallow breathing despite doing yogic breathing before heading out to prep my lungs. Still having allergy attacks once or twice per week. And still wheezing at some point near daily.

I don't at all regret getting the vaccine, though I will have to consult with a doctor about boosters. I just wonder if the vaccine is making my seasonal allergies (which are usually mild) way worse than usual, in turn causing the breathing and heart rate issues?

Update 5/3: Just over four weeks since my second dose and things are settling back to normal. Allergies have calmed down to normal levels and I had my first full 5k run with normal breathing this weekend.  Just needed to be patient.

I just got vaccinated with the 1st shot a few days ago and so far, I haven't really suffered. The side effects I experienced were only felt on the day of the vaccination and a little on the second day. The only lingering thing is the tiny injection pain that is pretty much negligible. I was fortunate enough to have never been infected by the coronavirus, I had a coronavirus test done a few months ago and it was negative for everyone of us here at home.

Since it seems like my 1st shot is not horrible and I didn't suffer, do you think I will have a more horrible experience for the 2nd shot? If so, how much more horrible will it be? 

I'm trying to keep a detailed record every day of my 1st shot experience so I'll share with you what I have so far. I wonder if other people experienced the same thing.

Age: Late 30s

Sex: Male

Weight: 200, probably 20 to 30 pounds overweight.

Pre-existing Conditions:

- High Blood Pressure

- Hypothyroidism

- Lower Back Pain

- Side Body Pain

- Left and Right Knee Pain

- Feet Pain 

- Tinnitus? (I hear a high frequency sound when there's no other noise around, but I don't even notice it during normal situations because everything else make sounds.) I've had this since childhood but I never bothered to ask anyone about it because I thought it's normal.

Doctor: Never seen a doctor since 2004, stopped taking heart high blood pressure medicine, don't have the money for that, I just powered through whatever pain or sickness came my way. Only time I took pain reliever was for toothache and that was long ago.

Night Before Appointment:

- 3 hours of sleep, couldn't sleep at all and got woken up too early. Spent so much time reading and preparing for potential horrible side effects.

- Ate only canned pineapples and mandarin. Sucked the juice out of canned sweet corn, spat out the rest. I needed to time my poo before 1pm vaccine appointment. Pineapples and mandarin sure did it for me. Last thing I wanted to happen was poo at CVS, I don't like public restrooms and they're probably closed anyway!

- I'm a heavy drinker of juice and water so even before I got signed up for vaccination, I was already always hydrated.

---------------------------


April 25, 2021

1:15pm - arrived at CVS, kept massaging and moving left arm to prepared it for injection. I read somewhere that this is a good way to lessen the left arm pain.

1:30pm - Moderna Shot 1, was told to stay in the store for 15 minutes.

1:45pm - 2:00pm - heavy, stinging sensation on left arm injection site. Kept moving it around in an attempt to make the pain go away just like what people online said. It seemed I succeeded. Bought Tylenol PM just in case some kind of unbearable pain occurs. Heart rate seems to have jumped while I was moving around in the CVS store, but I performed an inhale/exhale move to make it go down. It seemed to work as well.

2:00pm - 2:30pm - heavy, almost numb feeling on left arm injection site down to elbow, as if you slept on it. Continued left arm movement just to make sure the stinging pain stays gone. I hope it stays that way.

2:30pm - 3:15pm - weakened left hand grip with slightly numb sensation as if you slept on it. Laying tummy down on bed while typing this on computer.  Left hand grip seems to have strenghtened a bit near to full power. Most numbness gone, injection site of course still feels weird but possible to move around. No other weird feelings yet, but I'm expecting them to show up in a few hours, just like what happened to other people.

3:30pm - I have an extremely relaxed feeling, heart rate seems to be at the normal range of non-highblood people, which is weird because I have highblood pressure and my heart is supposed to be always a little faster than the average person's.

5:00pm - Chills, cold fingers, cold feet. I'm used to these as I always feel them at night, nothing new. I like cold so it doesn't bother me. I feel there is a fever, the hot but cold type. Nothing unusual, I also feel this way mostly at night. I fell asleep while playing GTA V.

7:00pm - woke up. Headache, not bad. Less worse than headache from not eating for a day. This headache is more comparable to a whole day of working in front of a computer and just wanting to eat. Nothing horrible yet.

7:20pm - No more weird arm feeling, easy to move for now. Hot and cold feverish feeling is still there.

11:00pm - ate Dominos Extravaganza pizza, 4 large slices, spat out remaining 4 since it's gonna be too much but I still wanted to taste it while watching stuff online.

--------------------------

April 26, 2021

2:40am - no more chills, seems like no more fever, no real pain on injection site. Watching shows online and playing games.

4:00am - went to sleep.

8:30am - woke up, sweaty legs. Went back to sleep. Injection site feels bruised. 

11:30am - woke up, sweaty legs. Went back to sleep. Injection site still feels bruised.

4:30pm - woke up, no more sweaty legs. Injection site still feels bruised so I forced to move it around. Bruised feeling diminished. Refreshed feeling. Strangely, my pre-existing joint and muscle pain seem to be not present. Maybe it's because of the good chopped up sleep.

5:30pm - ate tempura shrimps.

9:00pm - injection site feeling less bruised.


---------------------------------------------

April 27, 2021

12:00am - ate teriyaki chicken.

5:30am - went to sleep

2:30pm - woke up, slightly sweaty legs, injection site pain is almost all gone.

4:30pm - ate Dinty Moore stew with spaghetti, spat out most since there's too many and I don't want to be full but still wanted to taste it.

April 28, 2021

4:30am - ate canned pineapples.

5:00am - injection site pain is barely noticeable even if you bump it on objects. 

8:30am - went to sleep.

1:30pm - woke up, nothing strange so far.

3:30pm -  ate more Dinty Moore stew, plain, no spaghetti. Also ate canned pineapples.",1619693326.0,2021-04-29 03:48:46

No prescriptions, no drug use, just the occasional glass of wine or two. No underlying health conditions. She eats a healthy diet and takes good care of herself. Prior to the 2nd vaccine dose she was engaging in light to moderate exercise a few times a week. 

&#x200B;

March 1: After the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, she had a headache, chills, fatigue and most of the common symptoms that everyone gets. Within 24 hours, she was good to go and she resumed her normal activities with no issues.

April 1: Went and got the second Moderna vaccine around 11AM EST. Went through the day just fine, we went out to lunch, shopped around town, etc. Came home for the afternoon and just hung out on the couch watching TV. She wanted to go to bed a little earlier than usual, which is understandable because we both knew the vaccine was going to make us tired, etc. We end up getting in bed around 10pm EST. At 1AM EST, she wakes up feeling nauseous and she needs to use the bathroom. She gets out of bed and immediately passes out. She manages to regain some consciousness to call out to me. I rush to her and she's sitting against the wall and asks for water. I grab here some water and as she's drinking she starts blacking out. Her pupils got enlarged and as she was tipping over she became unresponsive. I immediately start smacking her trying to get her to wake her. Out of panic, I go to the fridge and grab water and managed to splash her. Somehow that woke her up. I called the ambulance and they noticed her heart rate was very low. I believe under 40BPM. Her blood pressure was also dropping, so they had to escort her to the hospital. The paramedics mentioned that they've had other people have similar episodes.

After undergoing several tests, they concluded that she was dehydrated and they gave her some IV fluids, and sent her on her way. She came back home, slept it off and felt somewhat normal the following day. 

Exactly 1 week after her ER episode, she calls me from the hair salon and she's beginning to feel like she's going to blackout again. After returning home, she drinks, eats and rests and the sensation goes away.

A couple of days later, she took a turn for the worst. She's having episodes of feeling like she's going to blackout, extreme weakness that comes out of no where. It got to the point where I had to take her to the ER again. After running multiple tests, they referred her to the cardiologist. The cardiologist is claiming that the vaccine may have caused inflammation in her stomach and it's causing her to lose salt which is throwing her off. The gave her some anti-nausea medicine and recommended that she keeps her salt intake high for a while. 

We are exactly two weeks from the cardiologist appointment and my wife is still having these issues, it's to the point where she can't get out of bed. She feels extremely lethargic with on/off nausea. She's also having episodes of feeling like she's going to blackout. 

I'm at a loss and can't figure out what's going on with her. Is anyone having similar side effects after their second Moderna vaccine?",1619573610.0,2021-04-27 18:33:30

1st dose: Had some fatigue and a hell of a sore arm. Iced my arm to help with the soreness and it went away after about 24 hours. Fatigue was gone by the next day.

2nd dose: One hour after the shot, my arm was cold. About 2-3 hours after, the rest of my body started getting cold. I bundled up and started drinking lots of water. I took my temperature and my body temp was actually lower than normal, so I continued to stay bundled up. That evening I was very tired and started to experience some body aches. I took some Tylenol and that seemed to help with the aches. I woke up in the middle of the night, shivering and achy. Still no fever, I never ended up having a fever. 

Those aches and fatigue lasted into the next day. By the 48 hour post shot mark, I was  completely fine.

**First dose** went okay, arm was sore, had a slight fever that wasn't debilitating or anything just needed to lay down and rest more frequently

**Second dose** \- in for a ride

**Day 1:**

4pm - got my 2nd shot.

First 9 hours was okay, didn't feel a thing, went to bed pretty relaxed. Normal day for me.

**Day 2**

7AM - Woke up early at fully delirious, in a very trancelike state. Very sore all over. Occasional stabbing pain in the outer part of my head. Occasional stabbing pain in arm. Very much a flu state.

7-10AM - ""Slept"" in a semi-awake state, didn't really seem to do much, so I wake up and have my coffee and at least dont feel so depressed laying in bed all day.

10-5pm - Tried to work on my computer but ended up taking various naps instead with 3 blankets stacked on top of me.

5-6pm: napped. Woke up feeling refreshed and felt like I was over some flu hump, so I decided to get up and eat. Oh boy that good feeling did not last. I was dizzy, sore, and wanting to lay down again. Thank god my mom had food prepared already as I was NOT feeling the cooking.

6-9:30pm: just laid down watching stuff on my phone. Drank and peed a lot

9:30pm - ok much much better now. I still feel sore but it feels like I'm past some sort of big hump. I ran up the stairs with energy and gonna take a shower.

Gonna go to bed now will update how I feel after.

Day 3 - 10AM: Ok I feel perfectly fine now. No symptoms at all.

**tl;dr advice for 2nd shot:** Flu will come around 16 hours later. Have some sort of flu-friendly dinner for the next day  (buy some chicken soup or hearthy stew). Be prepared with a big jug of water, phone charger, nintendo ds, everything and anything you need to lay in bed for the whole day",1619519404.0,2021-04-27 03:30:04

Before the pandemic I was in great shape , going to the gym 5 days a week . 
Since the pandemic my only exercise is daily walks and running after a toddler. 

I am diabetic , but have it under control WITHOUT medication and I  try to keep a keto lifestyle . I‚Äôm not always perfect with it , but less carbs and sugar means less inflammation to the body and better sugar levels . 

My first shot was easy peasy. In fact I even felt extra energized the day that I got the shot. Strange , but hey I‚Äôll take it over not feeling well. 
I had some soreness in my arm for a few days , but same type of soreness I get from any vaccine that I have had. 

Second dose I got today at 9:00 am . After one hour my arm was a bit sore , no biggie . 
Went back to work . ( I nanny a 2 year old and a 6 year old ) 
3 hours later I‚Äôm on my daily walk with the toddler ( been walking for about an hour )  I start to feel fatigue, really sore in the arm and have a headache ( I never have headaches) 
By the time I get back to the house , I have some chills , loss of appetite and just feel like - I just want to be in bed and sleep. 

My employer totally understood and let me take the rest of the day off. 
By the time I get into bed my lower back is also hurting. 
I laid down on a heating pad , drank water with Ultima Replenisher ( it‚Äôs an electrolyte drink mix with no carbs or sugars and it taste really good ) and took 2 doses of CBD oil . 
I fell right to sleep ( which usually I don‚Äôt , but the fatigue was real ) 

Woke up after 4 hours feeling much better. The fatigue,  chills and headache are gone . 
Back and arm much less sore.  

Since I was feeling better I went to unload and load the dishwasher....... big mistake my arm and back started to hurt again. Headache started to come back . 

So I‚Äôm probably not out of the woods yet. I have a feeling that pushing ones self to do things cause they are feeling better may make things worst . 
It‚Äôs probably best to take it easy for a few days after the second dose .
I think that can help the process of having less side effects from the second dose . 

I‚Äôm going to take it easy for the rest of the day and we shall see how it goes .

After the first shot, I was exhausted for 12 straight days. I was sleeping more and deeper than I usually do, but still needed multiple naps during the day. That, a sore arm and perhaps a little brain fog was it for the first 2 weeks. About 3 dozen bruises showed up on both my thighs for no reason between 2-3 weeks post (the shot was in my arm). I looked like someone opened fire on me with BBs. 3 days later, gone. Nothing I did could have caused them.

Shot 2 about 58 hrs ago (4/24). A couple hours in, the sore arm and the headache started. I went to bed about 12 hrs after and I didn't sleep at all. With the first one I couldn't get enough sleep, but there was no way I was sleeping that night. I was alternating between hot and cold minute to minute. Felt so-so the next morning, just sleep deprived. But then, my lower lip swelled to 5x it's normal size (I have had issues with angioedema in the past). Got steroids to make that go down. Then today, the on again off again low-grade fever started. My temp would go up for a few hours, go down for a while, then back up. That hasn't stopped.

I've regularly felt tired, but this is not the same. It's a drowsy, constantly sleepy, no concentration and neck aching kind of exhaustion. And it won't let up. I've had it for 4 days straight with plenty of sleep. It's taking a toll on my mental health quite severely now. After doing some brief research it sound very similar to the symptoms of CFS.

The problem is, I can barely find any information regarding delayed vaccine side effects. I can't say for sure the cause is the vaccine. I have a very anxious personality, I regularly over work and tend towards depression. I could have burned out and given myself CFS - still very scary - but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this with the vaccine and if it passes or persists? At the moment I am quite worried.

Otherwise, I keep myself in very good health. I work out everyday, eat healthy and get a lot of sleep.

5 minutes in it hit me in a sudden wave of heat what felt like all throughout my body. I got up and dropped my phone on the ground. Vision blurred and dimmed. I waved the nurse over and she had me lay down on a bench nearby and elevate my legs. Laid there for 15 minutes. Became less clammy. Nurse checked heart rate which was at 140. Laid there for another 10 minutes. Felt better. Vision normalized. 

Nurse came over again and sat me up. Took heart rate again. At 130 now. Feeling better, mostly normal since 45 minutes later. Nurse set me on my way shortly after. 
 
It's been 4 hours or so and feel mostly normal. Slightly clammy and chilled but nothing worrying. I'll update if anything changes.

1am crazy shivering, can't get warm in scalding hot shower (don't usually take hot showers)
4am woke up struggling to breathe
Itchy, hot skin with red blotches everywhere
Probable fever
Stuffy nose
Wheezing and gagging cough
Slight sore throat

So here I sit, wide awake, freaking out and calling every hotline in the middle of the night.

UPDATE: 
5 hours later, I wake up again and short of some burned skin from my shower, a few itchy spots, and a slight headache, I'm fine. So weird...  If it wasn't a delayed reaction OR my body fighting off the actual virus, MAYBE the coughing was some pollen? I'm genuinely so confused.

26 [M] 2nd vaccine experience/effects,4,mzamke,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/mzamke/26_m_2nd_vaccine_experienceeffects/,2,"Hey everyone. Got my 2nd Moderna vaccine yesterday \[3:48pm\] and wanted to share my experience so far. I'm about 26 hours in, so I'll post updates if needed.

Got the shot at 3:48pm, no noticeable side effects for about \~12 hours besides a small head ache. The injection site pain wasn't as bad as the first one. First vaccine felt like I had been punched over and over, where as this one (even 26 hours in) hasn't been bad at all. I recommend getting Salonpas to put over the injection site, seemed to work out for me.

I'm a night owl, so I was up around 3am when I started feeling hot and uncomfortable. No temp at this time, still only a light head ache, and I took a Tylenol just in case more symptoms appeared.

Fast forward to 5am. Tried going to bed around this time but couldn't get comfortable to save my life. Highest temp recorded was about 99.2, and I suspect that if I didn't take Tylenol I would have had a low grade fever. One thing I noticed was that I had to pee EVERY 15 MINUTES. It was absurd.

7am - Was getting stomach cramps and my body kept switching from hot to cold constantly. Checked my temp and it was 98.9 and I was shocked it wasn't higher. At this point I was also going through bouts where my whole body would start shaking for 15 minutes at a time, and my joints were pulsating with pain that lasted about an hour. Not sure if it was mental or not, but it was impossible to sleep until around 9am.

Woke up at 12p feeling disoriented and light brain fog. Still shaking quite a bit, but it didn't feel like chills. Very strange sensation to say the least. I made myself some chicken broth because at this point I was pretty nauseous and felt close to throwing up. THANKFULLY after drinking the chicken broth I was out until 5pm. Woke up, felt incredible. It was like day and night. Still have a light headache but that could be from lack of caffeine. Otherwise no other symptoms right now!

Overall it wasn't too bad. The body shakes were probably the worst part because it was so hard to sleep. Hopefully this is all I experience! I was definitely more nervous about this shot than the 1st, but it was 100% worth it and I'm feeling safer than I have in a year :) Cheers to everyone who's getting there vaccines!  


EDIT: No side effects from 1st vaccine besides the sore arm. Maybe a bit of fatigue but nothing unusual. ",1619507176.0,2021-04-27 00:06:16

I have never had Covid, I have asthma so I‚Äôve been living and working in my house for a year to keep myself and my son safe since he is asthmatic as well. I knew from reading all of your posts that there may be some symptoms but didn‚Äôt think I would feel like I had a bad flu.
Tylenol doesn‚Äôt do anything for me so I am taking Advil every 6 hours or so. Slept for 9 hours last night (normal is 7). Had to go ship a Reddit gifts present and get food but that completely wore me out and I was out of the house for a total of maybe 30 minutes.

39F both doses experience,9,mz20yr,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/mz20yr/39f_both_doses_experience/,8,"I received my first dose 3/23, second 4/20. I‚Äôm overweight but an active jogger, healthy overall with no issues (just had a physical and blood work!) After my first dose I was a bit run down and tired for three days -this was also during the week leading up to my period, so PMS could also be to blame.

I had my second dose in the late afternoon Tuesday and woke up the next day at 8 AM feeling slightly run down. I took off of work that Wednesday as a precaution, and was glad I did because I felt like I‚Äôd been hit by a truck by 11 AM. To make matters worse, my period had also started.

I alternated between ibuprofen and acetaminophen every few hours to feel better. It felt like a regular sick people body ache -I checked my temperature and it stayed around 98.8¬∞ over two days. I took the next day (Thursday) off as well, but felt well enough by noon.

I went back to work Friday and woke up with a headache. I‚Äôm not a person who normally gets headaches, so this stands out to me. Friday night I had 3 alcoholic drinks which is normal for me, then woke up Saturday with a full-blown migraine, despite staying hydrated. I actually had to put ice packs on the base of my neck to alleviate the pain in addition to taking acetaminophen. 

I had a normal Saturday with no drinking or anything, but had some nausea and dizziness around dinner time. Unfortunately had some acid reflux in the late evening, leading to me vomiting. IDK if this is necessarily related to the vaccine, but it happened so I‚Äôm including it. 

Sunday and this morning I woke up with slight headaches again. I really hope this is something that goes away since, like I said, I‚Äôm not someone who normally gets headaches. I‚Äôve read some initial scientific research that the vaccine can impact the menstrual cycle. From my first to second vaccine, my cycle was 24 days, and 24-27 days is normal for me. 

Overall I‚Äôm very glad I got the vaccine as I‚Äôd much rather deal with these annoying side effects right now, than a full blown illness that could impact my health and ability to exercise for the rest of my life. I hope I don‚Äôt put anyone off from getting it, I‚Äôm just trying to be thorough. For the record, I‚Äôm the kind of person who also feels really crummy after the flu and tetanus vaccines, so I guess my body just has a very strong response to inoculation.",1619484333.0,2021-04-26 17:45:33

UPDATE: Not long after this post I noticed my Lymph nodes under my left arm (injection arm) were swollen and tender. Fever lasted till around 7pm and then everything started to go back to normal. Woke up this morning with no problems other than the still swollen Lymph nodes. I looked into it and it appears this is normal after any type of vaccine and they can remain swollen for a few weeks. Mine seem to be calming down as I type this. So basically I‚Äôm about 98% fine now. Drugs wise I took 2 Tylenol before bed last night and 2 today to help with the swollen LN. If you‚Äôre worried about side effects, I recommend taking them if you can, as soon as your symptoms kick in. I wanted to see how long I could go without so I could get a good feel for what was happening. 
Good luck everyone and stay safe",1619411482.0,2021-04-25 21:31:22
2nd Shot Longer term Brain Fog and Dizziness/Vertigo Side Effects,8,myj11e,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/myj11e/2nd_shot_longer_term_brain_fog_and/,22,"Hi all,

Im a 22 year old male and I got my 2nd Moderna shot this past Wednesday (4 days ago). My only side effect from my first shot was a sore arm. In regards to my side effects from the 2nd shot, I initially experienced body aches and a decent headache (nothing too severe), which faded over the course of the next day. That same Thursday evening I began experiencing some very uncomfortable vertigo/dizziness pretty regularly. Shortly after this I also began to develop a fairly intense brain fog in which my thoughts and even memory have seemed scattered and confused. Today, Sunday (4 days after shot) I still am dealing with this dizziness and brain fog. This is all somewhat strange to me as my physical side effects were not too bad, no fever or nausea, but these mental elements are quite alarming and in their own way quite debilitating. 

I'm wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience with their 2nd dose side effects and may have any indication of when this will fade away? I'd greatly appreciate your thoughts! 

Thank you!",1619417687.0,2021-04-25 23:14:47

The next morning I started running 101. Thankfully the fever only lasted that day. I had a severe migraine, body aches, and joint pain. My normal pain medication didn't touch it. It was a rough day. 

Day two and three however were the worst. My entire upper arm swelled up, dark red rash that was hot to the touch and itched. My heart rate swung wildly between 58 and 154. My oxygen was consistently in the low 90's when laying down. But standing or moving around it'd drop as low as 75. 

Day four and five, I only had issues with heart rate while attempting to clean my kitchen. Arm was still swollen and itchy. 

Day six, feeling most normal just a little weak. Arm better but covered in hives. 

Day seven, mostly back to normal. Rash is mostly cleared, I barely see it but it's still itchy.

The Fastest Fever in the West - My Second Round Story,14,my9mdx,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/my9mdx/the_fastest_fever_in_the_west_my_second_round/,18,"‚ÄúAmerica is all about speed. Hot, nasty, bad ass speed."" 

-Eleanor Roosevelt, 1936

24 M. I don‚Äôt know how many of you had extremely accelerated symptoms after the second round, but I was astonished by how quick ‚Äúthe worst‚Äù was. 

Yesterday I got the dose. Unlike the first, the nurse did not jab it that hard into my arm, so I felt no pain going in. Like the first, I experienced muscle soreness the first day. 

Last night was unpleasant though. ‚ÄúHot, nasty‚Äù speed for sure - I was sweating buckets and had a quick fever and chills for about 2-3 hours. Also had one of the worst headaches in my life. Imagine your head as a drum, being beaten by the overly enthusiastic kid from band class. 

 Around 3:30 AM or so I took two Tylenol. By the time I woke up the headache was gone, I had no fever, there were some remnants of the ‚Äúheadache from hell‚Äù but nothing else, and as I write this, I don‚Äôt feel bad. 

Has anyone else been dragged through the worst symptoms super quick - completely overnight? People I know have had the fever for about a day and felt terrible, but I only had it for a few hours. A fast-tracked version maybe? I hope the worst is over, and I won‚Äôt get on that ride again. (I doubt it). It was unpleasant, to say the least, but all the symptoms were almost... condensed. This has to have been the fastest fever I ever had.


Edit and Update: 4/25 or Sunday evening I had a fever of 101¬∞F throughout the end of the day, but I didn‚Äôt have hot flashes like I did in the night. (And yes men like me can indeed have hot flashes.) I felt weak and achy, but it all died out by Monday morning. I took my temperature and it was 98.",1619390424.0,2021-04-25 15:40:24

Dose 1 & 2 Experience!,9,my1zjb,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/my1zjb/dose_1_2_experience/,0,"I (26 M, healthy) received dose 1 about 4 weeks ago, and dose 2 yesterday. Here was my experience:

Dose 1: Clammy and sweaty about 1 hour after the shot. Felt a little tired but okay until 8 hours after the shot. I took my dog for a walk and came back feeling really tired and out of it. I went to bed early that night and slept 12 hours. I felt feverish all day the next day. My arm was mad sore for days to the point where I couldn‚Äôt move it at all. I started getting back cramps and spasms which lasted a week. It made moving my torso nearly impossible - talked to my doctor and was worried at first, but it began to decrease in intensity around day 4. Mentally felt fine after day 2.

Dose 2: Much more ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù. I made sure to move my left arm every 10 mins doing windmills and all sorts of shoulder stretches and arm movements for a few hours which helped tremendously with soreness. I took the jab at 5 PM, and felt feverish through the night. I woke up the next morning (today) feeling extremely lethargic. It felt like a bad hangover, topped with being sick. I drank water, coconut water, mango lassi, and Gatorade which helped a ton. I was hungry but didn‚Äôt feel like eating all day. I napped for probably 4 hours off and on today. It‚Äôs now night and I feel back to normal, aside from shoulder soreness. 

Overall, shot 2 was easier for me than shot 1, predominately because of the back mobility issues. I‚Äôm hoping this post isn‚Äôt premature as I got my 2nd shot 30 hours ago.

Woke up Friday morning with body aches and a full-on, intense migraine. I normally get migraines but they're always manageable with OTC medicine. But that morning I had a strong sensitivity to smell--just the scent of the bar soap in my bathroom made me nauseous.

I was able to move around a little bit before the nausea really set in. I tried to will it away, but it finally got to a point I knew it was gonna happen. And thus broke my 10-year vomit streak.

Oddly, I felt a better afterward. I was able to eat some cereal (albeit very slowly) and eventually went back to bed. I could only nap for an hour, but woke up feeling A LOT better. My body no longer ached and my arm was hardly sore. Still had a hearty headache that lasted all day and night. But most importantly, the nausea and malaise were gone. I was able to do a little yardwork and even mowed my lawn.

Today, I still have a little headache and a few woozy moments, but was able to get back outside and complete more yardwork.

I wasn't expecting to throw up, but if that was the worst of my side effects, I'm content. It's like my body freaked out for a second and then got it together. This was all just the last 48 hours, so I consider it pretty decent overall.

i get anxious sometimes and was incredibly anxious to even get the vaccine and there has been a lot going on in the world and i have a high stress job. 

it definitely could be a coincidence but i‚Äôve been shaky before from anxiety and it didn‚Äôt feel like this or last this long. it‚Äôs also usually outwards where this time it‚Äôs internal. i‚Äôve also had some heart racing moments which could also be relayed to anxiety.

safe to say i‚Äôm a bit worried to get the second dose and debating on even getting it so wanted to see if anyone felt this way and if they did, when did it go away and do you have any tips to ease it?

thank u so much!",1619307888.0,2021-04-24 16:44:48

By 7pm, all hell broke loose and I had horrible body aches, an outrageous headache, and was running a fever of over 100 degrees F. I had an alarm set on my phone so that I could take ibuprofen or acetaminophen every two hours. Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep. My fever broke 33 hours after the injection, and now, 49 hours later, I feel almost normal again aside from some short hot flashes and very very mild achiness. I also can't lift my arm, but that's to be expected. 

While I had a rough time, everyone is different. My late 50s manager had no side effects whatsoever. My younger coworker only experienced fatigue. Either way, I'd do it all over again so I could be fully vaccinated.",1619305483.0,2021-04-24 16:04:43

And then Friday at 10pm, it just rushed in and took over my body.

I didn't have a chance to record my temperature, but I felt like I was over 100 degrees F. I fell asleep at 10, only to wake up at 1:30am. Thing is, I felt like I slept for over 10 hours. I began to have thoughts that just do not make sense. Like I thought it was already Sunday and I slept through the whole Saturday. When I woke up at 1:30am, I decided I had to take a Tylenol. It helped with the fever immensely. However, I kept on drinking water. Finished 2-3 water bottles in a span of 30 minutes. The thing is, I didn't have to go to the restroom at all. 

I took this as 'my body needs water to fight the damn virus' and kept drinking water. 

I don't know how, but I finally fell asleep at around 3-4am, only to wake up at 7am. Right now my body isn't the crazy feverish temperatures I had at 1:30am. I am just trying to go back to sleep with no success.

Note: I had a pretty significant reaction to the first shot so expected to have the same with the second.

Arm pain - pain radiated from injection site to fingers and fluctuated from uncomfortable to almost unbearable off and on throughout the next 48 hours. Felt better if I slept with pressure on the arm itself, but once I took it off, it throbbed relentlessly. Still have swelling, redness, and tenderness almost 60 hours later. 

Fever - consistent low grade fever; spiked to 103.8 and plateaued between 99 and 101 for some time. Broke after 36 hours, but returned after 48.

Brain fog and confusion - consistent for first 24 hours. 

Nausea/vomiting - was not able to keep most foods down, but alleviated after 24 hours. Returned after 48 hours and continued on to 60 hours.

Swollen foot - unsure if this is direct result of vaccine, but important enough to note. Left foot was very swollen after 48 hours (same side of injection). This was after returning to work and being on my feet.

Kidney pain - experienced pain similar to passing a stone in lower left kidney area a few hours after the shot. Continued until about 24 hours after.

Joint pain - all joints tender for the first 24 hours (all knuckles, elbows, knees, ankles, wrists). I experienced this with the 1st shot as well. 

Itching - whole body, moderate level itching for almost 24 hours. No rash, just sensation. Returned at 60 hour mark.

General flu like symptoms- have carried over past 48 hour mark 60 hour mark.

You're wondering how this is relevant - especially with that weird title.

18 or so hours after my 2nd shot I began experiencing pain at the site of my most recent injury (torn shoulder, surgery) as though I was freshly re-injured. By hour 23 this was the case with almost every severe injury I've ever suffered. Shrapnel still in my body throbbed, previously broken and long-healed bones ached, scars burned and itched. I was in excruciating pain.

It was like a journey back through time with the vaccine playing all my greatest hits (somewhat literally). A temporal ass-beating. It was awful. But by around 0845 the morning of the 22nd all of the pain was gone just as subtly and mysteriously as it had arrived. I ran 3.5 miles and worked out this morning. Feeling great.

I‚Äôll list what has happened so far pending me to add any more side effects that might occur since I just got the vaccine. First side effect was a slight rash on my chest area approximately 1 hour after vaccine. Second side effect again 1 hour after vaccine, I felt a slight dizziness in the bathroom and caught myself. Third side effect is approximately 2 hours after vaccine which hit me pretty hard, I started having shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. My heart rate elevated drastically not sure if this was because of an allergic reaction or just sheer panicking. This was going on for 30 minutes then got very intense to where I called out for a family member and I  could barely speak. My sibling came to me finally and  I was calmed down, still difficulty breathing and shortness of breath but able to manage it. For 2 more hours I laid down in my bed in a still spot just focusing on my heavy breathing and kept my heart rate low and the side effect just disappeared. I hope this is the worst of it so far. 

I guess my question is, was this a non-life threatening allergic reaction or just a turn up of severe side effects my body managed to produce. How rare these side effects to other people if anyone has that analytic data, would be great.

Just wanted to check if anyone has experienced anything similar as I haven't found much information online.  I received my first Moderna vaccine on March 30th, so a little over three weeks ago.  About 10 days ago I noticed a chronic very low magnitude headache that has persisted on and off since then (comes and goes for 3-4 hour periods during the day).  In addition I also have had semi-regular tinnitus events (7 in total, once a day or every other day) where I experience rapid onset right, left, or both ear ringing for a few seconds. It has been both low tones as well as high tones, and they always have subsided about 5 seconds after starting.

I almost NEVER have gotten headaches prior to this and definitely not one that has lasted similarly for a week or so, and the rapidly onset tinnitus has been a bit strange as well.

I'm personally a huge proponent for vaccines and I drove quite a while just to receive mine, and now I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar.  If you have, were these side-effects changed at all (worse, better?) after you received your second shot?

Thanks :)",1619151741.0,2021-04-22 21:22:21

8-9 hours post injection: All of the above, plus chills and muscle twitching. Temp of 98.5 (I run cold, usual temp around 97.7). Heart palpitations and shortness of breath twice upon standing. Drank some Gatorade, took two extra-strength Tylenol, and went to bed.

9-19 hours post injection: Slept terribly‚Äîwas constantly waking up, too hot or too cold, sweaty, uncomfortable, sinus headache, occasionally nauseated. Took an Ibuprofen around 3am, which seemed to help me sleep a little better.

Anyway, now that the day is so near I‚Äôm really psyching myself out & am pretty scared to go get this done tomorrow. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll avoid panicking and thinking I‚Äôm having an adverse reaction.  So any tips on how to avoid this/keep myself calm? Yeah, I know I have anxiety about potential anxiety. But, that‚Äôs my ADHD hyper-fixating on this entire situation. Also, I wanted to ask does anyone know if Adderall & this vaccine would not mix well or one make the other less/more effective? Should I skip my meds tomorrow? One more thing (promise) I‚Äôm scheduled to work tomorrow night 7pm-7am. Will I need to call out? TIA. Just need some reassurance.",1619108314.0,2021-04-22 09:18:34

I woke up and felt exhausted, but got in my car and figured I‚Äôd feel fine by the time I got to work at 5am.

At this point it was just a precaution as my job still needs to get done. 

I got home, sat down, and expected to feel sort of sick but how bad could it be? Famous last words. 

The first thing that hit was the chills. My jaw was chattering, it was so bad. By 10am I had a fever of 101.1. I sat on the couch, turned on Netflix, and expected to just ride it out. I fell asleep and woke up around 2pm, completely exhausted and with a brutal headache. I ate dinner, watched some more TV and went to bed.

The admitting nurse at the urgent care center took her vitals and stated that she did have a low-grade fever, but all of the other symptoms that she described were normal and there shouldnt be any major cause for concern. She was discharged from urgent care with ondansetron to treat the nausea, and ibuprofen for the pain.

In a few days I'm about to get stabbed with the first Moderna shot, then next month will be the second. I am coming into this with a very worried outlook because of the bad side effects that people have experienced on the news, [like the one where the guy got paralyzed and can't speak now](https://nypost.com/2021/04/15/man-partially-paralyzed-unable-to-talk-after-jj-vaccine/). I am being very honest here and if I could escape from getting this, I would, but this is a family affair for me where everyone HAS to get it so I'm just going along. Thankfully all throughout this coronavirus situation, it seems I never got it according to a coronavirus test.

If I could get some insight from those who have managed to prepare before getting their Moderna shots, that would be much appreciated!

What are the preparations that will help make you suffer less before the first Moderna shot?

I'm thinking about fasting a couple of days before that. I wonder if that will help. I read around and saw one story where the guy threw up/had diarrhea a few hours after getting the first shot. Maybe if I don't have anything in my stomach, there will be nothing to throw up or poop out.

Is this Moderna also safe for people with highblood pressure? I've had that ever since I was a kid, still do now. I've stopped taking medicine for it a long time ago, medicine's expensive and I seem to be ok. I'm wondering about those blood clot deaths, does that have something to do with heart problems? 

I also heard people suffer for a couple of days, so I guess that means no driving or doing stressful things after that shot? I guess I better finish up my duties before getting it because I'm the only one people at home can rely on when it comes to physical labor.

Aside from highblood, I don't think I have other health problems. Non-smoker, no drugs, no marijuana/recreational drugs, no alcohol, no vape, no whatever vices. 

I hope if I'm gonna experience bad stuff, it'll just be the headaches since they are usually easy to deal with. Cramps, I hope to never experience those again. Having side/stomach cramps hurt like hell based on my experience. I'd rather have leg cramps than stomach cramps.

Anyway thanks in advance for any advice that might help make my first and second Moderna shots less horrible and terrifying. I'm honestly worried but this is something I cannot escape.",1619051007.0,2021-04-21 17:23:27

I did an antibody test mid-January and came back positive for the antibodies so PHP basically concluded I had a false negative in Dec.

Second Moderna shot knocked me on my ass. I didn't have any issues with the first (received on 3/22) aside from COVID arm but I didn't realize that was what it was until I ended up here. I bruise super easily so I wrote it off as a normal side effect.

I had my first dose on 3/19, I had the sore arm pretty much immediately. About 2 hours after the shot I was a little dizzy and lightheaded, drank some water and had something to eat and that helped. Felt really tired and went to bed early that night. Woke up the next morning feeling fine, arm was very sore for the next 3 days, like so bad the pain extended into my back, armpit and neck. But eventually went away, no other side effects. Second shot was on 4/16 at about 3pm, arm was only sore for a few hours, did not hurt as much as the first one. Went to bed feeling normal, expected to wake up with that second dose sickness that a lot of people have had, but woke up fine. No arm pain, no fever, nothing. Have been fine since. Second shot was more of a breeze than the first. Hoping this information helps anyone out there who may be having any anxiety. :)",1618966095.0,2021-04-20 17:48:15

Sunday, was fine except sore arm, headache, some nausea off and on, mild fatigue. 

Monday felt pretty okay, arm soreness gone, headache still persisting.  Semi fatigued, got hot and cold/chills a couple times through the day. 

Today(Tuesday)- increased nausea, almost constant, sporadic headaches and a terrible taste in my mouth I can‚Äôt describe.  ( I‚Äôm in the dental field, and know it‚Äôs not dental related)  also the fatigue today is intense, haven‚Äôt been able to sleep, been up since 3am.

It‚Äôs Tuesday evening and I‚Äôm still extremely nauseous and tired. Skipped my evening class and left work early.

Dose 2 experience,8,muvye0,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/muvye0/dose_2_experience/,7,"20F. Got my second dose noon yesterday. Windmilled a bunch lol. First dose made me a bit tired but other than that nothing.

6pm: headache, general achiness/fatigue and feeling pretty shitty so I popped a Tylenol. 

7pm: fever of 100F, but around 8:30pm it went down and I was feeling great and back to normal. Took advantage of this to get some fresh air outside and eat some food.

Midnight: took Tylenol and went to bed. Woke up several times during the night to pee and drink water, definitely felt sick but overall nowhere near what I‚Äôve heard about.

This morning: felt OK, a bit sick and achey and arm really sore. Took Tylenol again, drank lots of water and sweated my 99F fever out. 

1pm: still achy and weak/can‚Äôt really lift my arm and don‚Äôt feel like doing anything but lying in bed. Throat lymph nodes swollen. But I feel more normal now and my symptoms have gone away for the most part.

Update: 3pm and 100F fever and chills have returned prob bc tylenol wore off :(

3:30pm - took tylenol and 1hr nap

4:30pm woke up incredibly hot, fever up to 102.4

5:30pm tylenol finally kicked in, feeling a bit better

8:30pm: chills starting again and running 101.5 fever

2am: woke up with fever and took Tylenol. stomach cramping and headache and overall body pain. Could not sleep again until 4am 

9am: woke up with 101 fever and general pains in my body, took Tylenol

3pm: temp down to 97.5 (first time it dropped below 99), mild nausea but otherwise feeling good after 1pm tylenol

6pm headache nausea starting to feel a little cold

Moderna second shot report,6,muwpbz,modernavaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernavaccine/comments/muwpbz/moderna_second_shot_report/,3,"Sharing to encourage people to get the vaccine! 23yo M, never had COVID. 

After first shot my arm was pretty darn sore for about 2 full days, but I think that was mostly because I hadn‚Äôt yet heard about moving it around and sat in a car for two hours immediately after the shot. I had a little brain fog the first night, but that was it. 

Second shot was administered 10:40 am on Monday. I vigorously moved my arm afterwards and went about my day as usual. At around 4:30, I felt a bit of brain fog and wooziness, but was able to dispel it with ease when I had to focus for a rehearsal. Had a mild headache around 7, which was pretty much eliminated after eating. 
More noticeable symptoms set in around 11 ‚Äî I had chills and put on multiple layers to stay warm. Felt too wired for bed until 1:30 am. Lying in bed was bearable, but difficult to fall asleep because of minor nausea. After a couple hours of fitful sleep, I woke up at 3:00 am feeling far too warm, and took off all the extra layers. By the time my body acclimated back to a normal feeling temp, I felt almost 100% fine and slept through the rest of the night without issue, like a switch had been turned off. I guess I sweated out the fever, because it really was a quite binary feeling. 
After waking up on Tuesday, I‚Äôve been feeling a little lethargic and with skin slightly sensitive, but it‚Äôs very minor. My arm never really hurt at all, excepting when I raise it over my head or move it back. 

Good luck to everyone!",1618971467.0,2021-04-20 19:17:47
