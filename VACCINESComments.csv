"Hey there, sorry to hear about your situation. Kudos to you for being brave! Few important things:

1) From the following vaccine finder link, only select the Pfizer vaccines for 12+, type in your zipcode and search. This will bring up a list of places that offer the vaccine. Call them and find out what requirements if any do they have for an accompanying adult with you.  Laws vary from state to state so best to call the pharmacies that offer the vaccine to find out. 

https://www.vaccines.gov/search/

Also, search the minor consent law in your state here: https://www.vaxteen.org/consent-laws-by-state

2) Do you know the phone number of your doctor / pediatrician, assuming you had a WellCare check at some point? They will have your immunization record (if any were ever given). School guidance counselor, school nurse, or teachers can also be a big help. Schools need to have your immunization records (or exemptions) on file unless of course you are homeschooled. Essentially, besides getting the COVID vaccine, best to get a copy of immunization record so you know whether you need a catch-up schedule for important other vaccines. 

3) Look up your local immunization coalition from the link below. It’s good to keep their info handy. You can call or email them for help/direction too. 

https://www.immunizationcoalitions.org/network-members/?listing

4) Here is a very good blog on the COVID-19 teen vaccine if you want to take another run at convincing your parents (in case there is a slim chance). I understand you may have already tried...

https://blog.chocchildrens.org/the-covid-19-vaccine-and-teens-what-parents-should-know/

Here is a link that addresses common vaccine myths in general. 

https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/questions-about-vaccines/video-faqs/

And finally this short pager from the CDC that teens can use to talk to their parents about vaccines. 

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/downloads/prepare-infants-508.pdf

I know I shared a lot of resources :-). Feel free to DM me if you want to chat. I hope it all works out for you! Start with the vaccine finder (first link), call and find out what requirements are there for accompanying adults in your state. Then, you can follow through with other links.",nqm9cq,2021-06-02 18:14:56

"This is not legal or medical advice : but i assume that if one goes to the pharmacy one can get a vaccine. If they refuse by saying that person is too young/ needs an adult signature, one maybe can walk into a (liberal) place of worship, a hospital,  or the department of human services, or youth outreach services, and ask for a confidential meeting with a counselor or social worker -and see if they can confidentially arrange a vaccine or a signature.",nqm9cq,2021-06-02 17:18:01
"that is inaccurate. Appreciate the effort, but I want to be sure we don't take a marginalized group (12-17yr olds) for whom travel, time, etc is much harder, and give them false expectations. Guessing isn't helpful for these groups, it puts them at risk.

very helpful thank you,nqebj9,2021-06-02 07:09:33
On second thought... Looking at the graph in that article... If it's simply a matter of producing the vaccine at the same time as it's being tested... Then why arent the vaccines approved yet???,nqebj9,2021-06-02 14:52:35
Which covid vaccine specifically?,nqebj9,2021-06-02 09:46:58
"EUA is when there's a known health risk so large (like covid) that we need to address and don't have time for all the testing, documentation and routings/approvals. The gov will make a call to release an unapproved product so that people can access it if they need it for their health, the belief being it may reduce the health crisis at hand

 EUA is a tool for addressing health emergencies, products released on EUA are not approved, they are 'authorized for use' for a period of time, that eventually will end regardless of FDA approval or not. This time window of EUA can be extended if the FDA sees fit, but it is not a permanent thing. It is a temporary authorization to address an emergency that won't wait for us to develop a vaccine

FDA approval occurs when a new medical product has passed testing, the data collected allows the FDA to be confident the product being released is safe and effective",nqebj9,2021-06-02 16:04:28

"I got the Moderna vaccine and the next day I felt miserable... But as far as I know this is just your immune system at work... please note that I'm not a doctor. If you feel seriously ill, you should go see one. It was all gone for me by the third day.",nqb231,2021-06-03 01:03:14
I have 6 friends who all got pregnant AFTER vaccination of Pfizer or Moderna in the last 6 months.,npzxk6,2021-06-01 19:27:44
"Anecdotally—yes, I know people who have gotten vaccinated and then gotten pregnant.

Another way to evaluate this is by using animals in specific DART studies. These were done—even in large, repeated doses, no issues in reproduction or fetal abnormality.",npzxk6,2021-06-02 00:55:09
"Personally, I think It seems a little early to conclusively say that the vaccine is making pregnancy difficult. I've seen that concern come up a lot of times on social media, but it always seems like paranoia.",npzxk6,2021-06-01 23:08:25
[removed],nox3db,2021-06-01 05:19:03
"You are always at risk, even with the vaccine.

Humans are not great at objectively judging risk. We have survived this long by over estimating risk in every risky situation.

Vaccines are very protective but exactly how protective depends on the situations your family is in.

When you say "" get together"" what does that mean? A couple hours in doors? An afternoon outside? What about your local transmission levels? The risk goes up dramatically if you have a lot of local community transmission and they don't limit their exposure risk. Same if you are in doors with poor ventilation. There are ways to mitigate done risk if you are worried.

Other poster is right though. Risk would be much less if they were vaccinated.",np14da,2021-05-31 15:00:23
"Concur with everyone else in the thread. The efficacy rate is a mean, it varies person to person based on various factors: age, immunity issues, medications, etc. Also, the vaccines have different efficacy rates based on the variant they're tested against. That's part of the concern, really... 95% sounds great. But you don't even trust 95% for your birth control (I imagine, most BC is like 99% effective). But its only 80% effective against the Indian and UK strains.   
The thing to understand is that this is about shared air. Outside, 100 feet apart, there is next to no risk. As you move closer, the risk increases. Outside there is less risk, although people can absolutely get it from eachother outside, but because the air is moving and constantly being refreshed, the risk is vastly diminished in regular situations. Unusual situations would be yelling, singing, coughing, etc and then the risk elevates again. 

Once inside, the risk greatly increases because there's less fresh air exchange and now you are sharing air, where the virus can linger for a long period of time (so the idea that you're not in the same room doesn't help. If you enter a room someone with COVID was in 20 minutes later.... you could still get it, even if they've left the room). 

If you decide to take this risk, mitigate it. Stay outside, more than 6 feet apart, with masks on. Even if they won't, you could double mask, but you have autonomy to create boundaries around your safety. I wouldn't, and have no plans to be inside with anyone who is unvaccinated (so there go restaurants for the foreseeable future) whether they are masked or not. I will not take that risk.",np14da,2021-05-31 16:28:24
"Your risk is as follows.

RISK = (Vaccine Efficacy X Risk of your Sister's Family Having it right now and not knowing it).  FYI Cases in the wild are nearing time lows also so it is very hard to catch now plus they would have to be sick right now and also not realize or tell you which is also extremely low odds.

Your Risk:

RISK = .05  X Approx .00001

RISK = .0000005  Which is miniscule and not worth worrying about.  You are Vaccinated.  Go enjoy life.",np14da,2021-05-31 17:35:42
"Yes. The vaccines are excellent at protecting people from severe cases of Covid and hospitalization, with those being exceedingly rare. It's unlikely but it's still possible to get a milder case of Covid if vaccinated. I'd check the Covid levels for your sister's community. They can be misleading as not all cases are reported but it will give you a better idea. The CDC has a Pandemic Vulnerability Index by county. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)

You can mitigate your risks by gathering outdoors or with a lot of ventilation.",np14da,2021-05-31 19:10:58
"You're certainly at a higher risk than you would be otherwise. Even for incredibly effective mRNA vaccines with 90 to 95% efficacy, somewhere between 1 in 10 and 1 in 20 vaccinated people will still be at risk of contracting Covid.

Although your vaccine gives you a very high level of protection, there is still a residual risk. If your sister and her family were vaccinated, your odds of contracting Covid from them would decrease by a further factor of 10 to 20. The fact that they are not vaccinated makes the residual risk far greater.",np14da,2021-05-31 13:08:01
"Honestly, if the vaccines protect 9 out of 10 people (90% efficacy) and everyone increases their exposure by 10x, you'll have the same odds of exposure as before vaccination when you were being safe.",np14da,2021-06-01 06:28:07
Great response,np14da,2021-06-01 06:29:45

The one that pfizer recommends and the FDA approved. Why is this a question? When you get dose 1 they automatically schedule your second dose (i think) 3 weeks later.,np55tx,2021-05-31 16:53:18
"There's misinformation in the comments here, so worth nothing:

1 - Manufacturers determine minimum intervals, not maximum (as in, they give a minimum amount of time between doses, but do not set a maximum. They may suggest a maximum range on best assumptions, but in reality maximum time between doses is determined by each government/country based on a variety of factors). This isn't new, this is the case for all vaccines, and this is why timing (and even number of doses) change/are different for things like the HPV vaccine. This is why in Canada, each province has a different HPV vaccine schedule! It's not a one-size fits all thing.

2 - There is some evidence that shows that effectiveness is higher for those who wait longer than 3 weeks... however...

3 - If you have a choice (and have met the minimum time), then get it asap. The best protection is what gets you protected asap. The time spent without protection is a real risk. Everything else is just guessing. Don't make health decisions based on reddit comments. :)",np55tx,2021-05-31 20:43:05

Definitely get an earlier appointment. Like I said, I think Pfizer recommends 3 weeks.",np55tx,2021-05-31 17:09:16
You're not fully protected until 2 weeks after your final dose so don't put it off.,np55tx,2021-05-31 17:09:47
It’s not an option in Canada right now. They are doing something similar to what the UK did which is give everyone one dose then go back for the second dose. I think they are allowed to wait up to 4 months in Canada. People in the 18-25 age category are not expected to get there second dose till mid august (this is for Ontario),np55tx,2021-05-31 17:46:08
"I mean, the vaccine roll out in many places in the US was a mess and flawed. But whatever the UK and Canada are doing is freaking insane! Where I live, any person 16+ who wants to be fully vaccinated is already. Now we're working on 12-15 year olds.",np55tx,2021-05-31 18:56:43
"I'm assuming you mean hep (hepatitis) B instead of heb B.

Regarding your father, I’m very sorry to hear that. A heart attack isn’t the same thing as myocarditis but maybe they meant the heart tissue was a little inflamed afterwards? It may be a stretch to attribute that to the vaccine.",nnqo4y,2021-05-29 19:57:08
"I had covid super bad for 6 weeks super sick back in Dec til mid January.

"Thank you for sharing your experience. I am pretty confident that if I did take the vaccine, odds are I will be fine too. Experts are saying the risk of myocarditis is less than 1%. My dad’s heart attack and subsequent inflammation and arrhythmia is likely a coincidence too. I’m just hesitant to risk the small chance without knowing the data. I still plan to take the vaccine after the myocarditis investigation.",nnqo4y,2021-05-29 20:01:47

"I don't have data at my finger tips, but I wanted to add my voice to that of your loved ones: ""You'll be fine!""

"In my county,  we have a HUGE drive through vaccination site. I'm talking 2,000+ pfizer vaccines given a day. When I went for my 2nd shot on May 8, I asked them if anyone had a severe allergic reaction (they monitor you for 20-30 minutes after your shot just in case). Mind you, that's 6 - 7 months into them giving the shots at this location. The RN told me no. 

Out of every person I know who's been vaccinated, the worst one with side effects has been body aches, diarrhea, and fatigue. My mother in law did get a fever from j & j but that lasted about 8 hours. 

I understand it is new and such a scary time... but the risk for something like that is so low, its unbelievable.",nngdkt,2021-05-29 07:43:09
"If you have never had any reactions to previous vaccines, that’s a good start. Have you ever had a serious reaction to anything else in your life? If not, also a good start. 

I was anxious too. Like really anxious. I ended up have a really mild second dose and am glad I went through with it. Everyone I know has been fine too, no life threatening or weird/scary side effects. The worst of it for someone was they were way more fatigued than usual for 3 days and pretty much slept for two days straight, but they are completely normal now. 

I know there are subreddits where people come to talk about their awful side effects, but seriously... half those people probably aren’t even having reactions to the vaccine (yeah, I know that’s a bit of a “hot” take, but if you take millions of people out of the population, a select few were already going to have some weird things happen to them anyway, vaccine or no vaccine). 

Obviously we can’t know for sure that you won’t be won’t of those super rare cases where something bad happens, but your chances of something bad happening from the virus itself are greater than the vaccines. 

Hope you have the next day off after your second dose. Have the pain killers/fever reducers ready, stick up on pedialyte, make some soup. drink a lot of water, and just plan to chill the next day! I did that and ended up being totally fine lol",nngdkt,2021-05-29 07:59:27
"Do not worry, even an anaphylactic shock, which is extremely rare, is manageable at the site.",nngdkt,2021-05-29 14:05:37
"The odds are less risky then getting in a car. Walking outside in a rainstorm without getting hit by lightning. Interacting with a dog without being bit. Its completely normal to be anxious about the unknown, but the reality is that a lot of people don't experience ANY side effects. Since we related side effects to efficacy of the vaccines, you don't hear much about it. In my experience as a vaccine volunteer, people generally only have a reaction to the first OR second vaccine, and the overwhelming vast majority experience what you're talking about- flu like symptoms starting about 12 hours after the dose, lasting 24 hours. 

We've all had a very long, traumatic year, and lets not underestimate the power of psychosomaticism.Meaning.... we keep telling people they'll feel like crap after the vaccine, and that its a good thing, and then.... they feel like crap:) Some of that is probably self manifesting. 

After the vaccination, drink a lot of water. Move your arm around a lot. While you shouldn't take anything BEFORE the vaccination, afterwards you can take tylenol (not advil, NSAIDS) to alleviate anything you feel. And the flu is a good way to describe what most people experience- chills, fever, tiredness. If you have the privilege of spending the day on the couch, plan for it, because even if you don't experience side effects, its been a long year. Take the chance. 

If you DO experience any side effects, don't jump to conclusions. Log it into VAERS [https://vaers.hhs.gov/](https://vaers.hhs.gov/) and if it persists, talk to your doctor about it.",nngdkt,2021-05-30 17:06:48

"There are many anecdotes out there (how extreme your side effects from the vaccine will be are related to how bad your COVID symptoms would have been, if you have side effects from the first shot, it means you had COVID before).

"They can be very different. However, that doesn’t mean strategies are inherently worse.

Some countries started vaccinating the elderly first, others started with healthcare workers. Indonesia actually started vaccinating young people, because they are more mobile and spread the disease.

In various countries the most important political persons are among the first to get the vaccine. Often they are vaccinated on camera, to encourage their people to get the vaccine as well. Also in the US, congressmen were a priority group I believe to ensure “continuity of governance”.  In many other countries, including mine, politicians are not a priority group. People would probably find it unfair that the elites will get it first.

Some countries also have other priority groups: military, police, teachers, obese people, people in mental care facilities, people with Down’s syndrome etc.

And this way, any country has its own strategy and priority groups. I guess any strategy is valid, as long as it can be explained.",nmqs0j,2021-05-28 08:37:46

Example: Nurse tells me to lift my sleeve and wipes my arm, my brain says ""remember that one scene from that movie you really like, that was really cool"" (or something along those lines). Boom. It's over",nltfti,2021-05-29 05:39:47
"If you're able to contact a doctor yourself or can convince your parents of the need, I highly recommend talking to one. Like others have said, some doctors will prescribe an anti-anxiety med for the event itself. Fear of needles is a common fear, and starting to recieve treatment for it now, to whatever degree, is likely to help in the long run. It can also be really helpful to practice self-soothing techniques to figure out what works for you before you are exposed to this anxiety trigger. 

I'll tell you what helps me with generalized anxiety and needle anxiety. The easiest one is [Box Breathing](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing). It's a breathing technique that is easy to remember even if you are really freaking out. I use it anytime I start hyperventilating or start becoming hyper aware of my breathing or heartrate and can't remember how to think normal thoughts anymore. I do suggest practicing it before you need it though, and during minor anxieties and big ones alike. It'll make it easier to remember to do it. 
I bring distractions. I have some earplug/headphones that help me keep my own internal monologue on track. I make lists in my head of pokemon or whatever or play puzzle games on my phone that actually require some brain power.  I pretend the needle-time is hypothetical, pretend, or that I am helping someone else who is doing it. I imagine music videos with fictional characters or whatever takes a lot of my brain's processing power. Have someone with you to make sure you're safe if you get woozy. Reduce sugar and fast carbs beforehand, try to have a protein snack of some sort. A read once that a panic attack can use as much blood glucose as a marathon. I'm not sure if that's true, but since then I've definitely noticed that a blood sugar drop usually makes the anxiety worse. I try to include fiber, healthy fats, and protein in meals to make sure my bloodsugar remains more stable.

"HI. My name is Amanda, and I'm a vaccine fairy. i help people get vaccinated, which sometimes means driving them, holding their hands if they're scared of needles, etc. Infact, I'm petrified of needles (like, legendarily scared). I totally understand your anxiety, and I may have some solutions for you.   
Honestly, it doesn't sound like the other concerns like FDA approval are really the issue, so lets ignore those for now. What I find really helps with people who are experiencing this anxiety is the following: 

1. Did you know (I did not) that your physician can script xanax for extreme cases of needle phobic people for things like essential blood draws? I DID NOT KNOW THIS AND IT IS LIFE ALTERING. tldr: talk to your doctor about it. Sounds like they may already be aware. 
2. waiting is the hardest part. You are in control of your vaccination experience. Have an advocate (this is what I do, but I'm not in Florida, unfortunately) to get you through it. This person will take care of all the bs with the registration, filling things out, etc. They will talk to everyone so you do not need to do ANYTHING until the moment you get vaccinated. This eliminates a lot of ""waiting"". Also, this person can tell the vaccinator what you need. This can range (""please do not speak to the person getting vaccinated, do not explain what is happening, they have anxiety and just want it done""). 
3. Knowing precisely what will happen is helpful. ""We are going to enter the vaccination site, and weave through a bunch of cones in the parking lot. We will arrive at the first tent, where a volunteer will ask for your ID and insurance card, and will ask some qualifying questions, and then place a M or P on the windshield wiper and waive us on to the second tent. In between will be volunteers showing us where to go. When we get to the second tent, another volunteer will ask for your vaccination card"" etc).
4. Find the RIGHT vaccination situation. For anxious people, i find drive thrus very effective. Sit in the back seat. Have headphones and a movie. Zone out. Let the person in front handle everything for you. When its time for the actual vaccination, have them turn around (or bring someone who sits next to you) and have them hold your hand. 
5. The needle is infact, very small. its only .5-1"" long, and only hold 1ml. The circumference of the needle is tiny. From the moment you feel the shot, its already over. That's how fast it is. I've taken about 12 needle anxious people through the process, many of whom have previously fainted after shots, and none have. They have all... EVERY SINGLE ONE, said they couldn't get over how small/painless it was. If you count to ""one"" it will already be over. 

I'm here to help. If you want to talk more about it, if you want help finding the right situation, I'm happy to do so, even in Florida! I bet I can find someone to go with you (sometimes a stranger is the best). Point is... you can get through this. I know you can. I believe in you, and we just have to find the right situation!!!",nltfti,2021-05-30 17:21:34
"You have 2, different issues. Problem 1, your phobia of needles. I too have a rediculous fear of needles I wish I could get over, had a bad experience as a kid and it's made me spooked of needles throughout adulthood. 

Separate this fear and anxiety from your second problem, your concern that the vaccine isn't approved. Do your research and make your own judgement on this, it's your body, do what you think is best for your body and your health/wellbeing. 

If you do your research and decide you want the vaccine, here's what I do to get over my fear of needles. 

1st, ask the doctor to go into your arm when they are ready, not when you are ready. You being ready will only escalate your stress. 

2nd, look away, at the wall or your parents or something. Distract yourself and do not fucking look back.

3rd, wait a minute while the doc does their thing. Before you know it you'll be out of there and will have made a major step in conquering your fear!

Edit: needles really don't hurt that much, there's more discomfort from having to take a wild dump than getting a needle, that being said I still fear needles to this day

Edit #2, the FDA approval will likely come in time, it's just too soon for them to give it the green light right now. it's not not-approved because it's dangerous, if that were the case they'd pull it off the shelves. That being said we're still learning the risks and benefits. The known benefits outweigh the known risks for the mRNA vaccines, although this may change as we continue to learn the side effects and benefits!",nltfti,2021-06-02 03:23:40
"yes, it's safe. It depends on your state laws for if you don't need your parents' permission. Every state is a little different.",nlsnjj,2021-05-26 23:10:56
"[VaxTeen](https://www.vaxteen.org/) has information on the consent laws for vaccines in the various US states including [Washington](https://www.vaxteen.org/washington).  Minors can be vaccinated under the ""Mature Minor Rule"" if they meet various criteria to show that they have sufficient maturity to understand the consequences of their care.  It does seem like that would be a bit of judgement call on the part of the medical provider.  I don't have much experience on that so I can't really comment on how easy it would be to find a medical provider that would be willing to give you.

Vaccines are very safe.  It is not unusual for teenagers and adults to get vaccinated for school, work, or immigrating to other countries.  The CDC does have a [catch-up schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/catchup.html) showing which vaccines you should get and the minimum time period between doses.",nlsnjj,2021-05-27 04:00:53
"Hey there! You are an awesome and brave teen! I can relate to how hard it really can be to find the right. I will break it down for you with links.

1) First off, since you have never been vaccinated, you need to get what is called a ""catch-up schedule.""  Only a doctor will be able to advise which vaccinations can be given together and which need to be spaced out. A complete listing of the 14 diseases that teens should be aware of (aside from COVID) can be found below, headers link back to CDC. Given we are in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that the doctor may advise getting the COVID shot, in which case they will also advise on how to space out the other vaccines you need (Tdap, measles, HPV, etc.)

[https://teensforvaccines.org/vaccine-preventable-diseases](https://teensforvaccines.org/vaccine-preventable-diseases)

2) Mature minor consent law exists in your state which means you need to talk to a doctor first to see whether they will allow. If you have access to a school nurse, it is usually the best place to start so you have privacy in your conversations. 

3) Email the immunization coalition in Washington. I have already searched the links for you. Depending on which county you live in, you can contact the nearest or you can contact the statewide. They are very supportive and can point you to local resources. 

Coalitions have a lot of parents too, so if you think there is a slim chance (if at all) that talking to an adult may convince your parents, they can help with that too.

"My parents both had COVID and received the vaccines. The adverse effects are the same as everyone else but they can sometimes be a little more intense since you have some antibodies in your system still.

"It’s been shown that people who tested positive for COVID and have symptoms can sometimes have fading immune responses that allow for re infection. Many patients will have a long lasting immune response but there’s no way to know for sure if you’ll have a sustained or short lived immune response. People who had milder infections were shown to be at a higher risk of. It having a long lasting immune response. 
Clinically, it’s more favorable to get vaccinated since you’ll have a more predictable response to infections and it’s been studied against other variants of COVID.

"I never said vaccines don’t have any documented side effects. I’m talking about antibody response so you’re not even paying attention. 
The adverse effects form the vaccines are during the short term (within about a month or so but typically always within the first 48-72 hours). 
Overall, the safety profile for the mRNA vaccines are excellent and have no long term side effects. It’s important to note that clinically, the effects of a drug are limited to how long the drug is in your system. If you understand pharmacology it makes sense why we don’t expect long term effects from any vaccine. Long term side effects come from taking medications for the long term: 

Also, the goal of becoming vaccinated is to stop severe illness and spreading the virus which can cause mutations and newer variants. You ultimately want the pandemic to stop and the vaccines are an incredibly safe and effective way to accomplish that",nkfdm3,2021-05-28 14:52:05

"No, it's not enough for a vaccine to be approved by the WHO for emergency use. Under current proposals, it would have to be approved by the EMA (European Medicines Agency). Right now there are [four](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines/covid-19-vaccines) vaccines approved by the EMA: Pfizer-Biontech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson.

However, at the moment, every EU country has a different policy about this, and it is likely there will continue to be some differences. Some EU countries (e.g. Germany) are only recognising those 4 vaccines for entry purposes. Some EU countries (e.g. Bulgaria) are also recognising others, including both Sputnik and Sinopharm. This is partly because several Eastern European countries have themselves been using those vaccines, even though they are not approved by the EMA. So, one strategy you might have is to take a vaccine like Sputnik and then enter the EU through an Eastern European country that recognises it. However, you have to be a bit careful, because, for example, Bulgaria is not yet in Schengen.

Your best bet may be to apply for a Schengen visa from a country like Slovenia, which does recognise these vaccines. Then you may have to spend a couple of weeks there before you can move on to whichever country you want to be in. But be prepared for sudden rule changes and for things to be much more complicated than they usually are.

As for choice of vaccines -- locally produced brands of Sinopharm are still considered to be Sinopharm. I don't think there's any political difference between Sinopharm and Sputnik in terms of likelihood they'll be approved in future. So you might as well choose based on efficacy/which one you trust more.",nkkgjg,2021-05-25 14:07:57
"EU will open up to travelers from countries outside of it around june. They said that travelers who are fully vaccinated form a vaccine approved by EMA, have a negative PCR test, or have had covid in the past 6 months will be able to enter without quarantining. They also said that vaccines approved by WHO may also be used for entering, but will let every member decide for itself whether it will allow tourists with those vaccines to enter. At the moment, Greece, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Austria and maybe some others, haven’t researched enough, allow you to enter with vaccines approved by WHO and even sputnik. In my opinion most EU members will allow you to enter with a WHO approved vaccine, so if traveling is your biggest priority and you can’t get an EMA approved one, get at least a WHO approved vaccine. If covid protection is a bigger concern to you, then get an EMA approved one or sputnik. Sinopharm is also better than nothing but it takes 2 weeks after the second dose to have a good protection against covid and it doesn’t work as well as others in people above 60, but should be fine for younger people. I took Sinopharm because it was the only one available at the moment. All of the vaccines give almost 100% protection from hospitalization due to covid.

Also sputnik has applied to be approved in EU and is being reviewed at the moment and Germany is pushing for it to be approved. Sinopharm still hasn’t applied, Sinovac has applied.

"That's like asking what the importance of the second layer of paint over your primer is.  

You do it because it's necessary to achieve the goal you want.

As for why?  It's dependent upon the specific vaccine.  Sometimes it's because the paint is see-through after only one application, sometimes it's because it looks uneven after only one application, sometimes it's because it doesn't look shiny enough. 

And each one of these might be caused by different chemical reactions.

So... to answer your question of ""Why do you get booster doses""... the answer is the same as why you apply multiple layers of paint: because doing so achieves the end result you want.

"There are ongoing studies investigating the effects of doing this. Thus far there's no reason to think there would be any safety problems with it. But of course, this is still uncharted territory.",nh4bth,2021-05-20 17:38:42
"I'm in the UK Novavax trial study and have definitely had both doses of the vaccine. I'm still blinded, but in a crossover study where they gave me two shots of the vaccine and two shots of the placebo. Novavax is still not licensed here either, but I have been given a certificate to say I have been vaccinated, which I'm hoping will be enough to ensure I can leave the country should I need proof of vaccination - I have a trip booked to Ibiza in October, so have a bit of time to check it out. I wasn't planning on having another vaccine.

I think I have seen another post on here where someone was in a similar situation and their Dr said they couldn't recommend having another vaccine, as mixing isn't yet fully studied, but they obviously couldn't stop you if you wanted to. Sorry that's not much help really.",nh4bth,2021-05-20 20:44:28

"Likely yes I will have to drop out of the study. I did complete the crossover and I know for a fact my first series of injections (back in January) were the real thing/the crossover was the placebo, so I hope my data might be of some use, but I couldn't logically carry on participating with muddied immunity.",nh4bth,2021-05-20 21:20:21
That's what I've been thinking too. Thank you!,nh4bth,2021-05-20 21:21:21
"Ugh, and you guys started the trial sooner than we did in the US, too. I also received a card after completing the crossover, but the place mandating the proof is only accepting one of the currently approved vaccines (Moderna, J&J, etc). 

I called the trial and they're thinking they won't have EUA until later in the summer. Sigh. :(

Hope you have better luck with your plans!",nh4bth,2021-05-20 21:18:31
"Such a timely topic as I am in the same boat as you. I completed the crossover and will be attending a two week follow-up for blood draw in the coming week. While up to this point I've been content to stay enrolled in the trial study, my state's upcoming ""reopening"" necessitates I be vaccinated with an EUA vaccine.  Given the Washington Post's recent article detailing the company's stumbles and general consensus that the FDA will approve the trial vaccine in late-july, I'll be going with J&J because it adequately meets my needs (FDA vaccine card) and it provides full vaccination after two weeks with minimal downsides (chiefly its shortcomings against certain variants that are not widespread in my state).

It's all very frustrating thinking about, though.",nh4bth,2021-05-21 05:52:26

"The blood draw is an opt-in procedure two weeks after last cross over appointment.  I haven't and won't discuss my decision to withdraw from the study until after I receive an EUA vaccine.  I don't need the hassle of feeling the need to justify myself nor do I want them to attempt to keep me in the study.

Remember, the vaccine won't be approved until July at the earliest. How many weeks do you think it'll take for your vaccine site to produce and distribute document? It won't be quick.",nh4bth,2021-05-21 21:58:57
"I braced to feel like a boulder was dropped on me, but ended up only having a very mildly sore arm and jet-lag-like fatigue for a day.

[Except for Sore Arm, 3 Out of 4 People Didn't Report COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/except-for-sore-arm-3-out-of-4-people-didnt-report-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects)

I've had a severe needle phobia my entire life and once fainted after a blood test and knocked out a front tooth, so I also was battling with anxiety. But I literally didn't feel the shot. I am not kidding. I thought he was joking when he said it was finished, but he wasn't. 

Though you've been very lucky to avoid contracting Covid your luck could run out. This summer there won't be as many people taking precautions, even if they're not vaccinated. Even if they've traveled. Young people haven't been as brutalized by Covid in the sense of hospitalizations but it can still be intense and more have experienced long-haul effects of it. My friend who had Covid in March of 2020 is also 29 and is *still* coping with extreme lethargy that has zapped her, difficulty breathing, mental ""fuzziness"" as she calls it, unexplained back pain and aches, stomach issues, and constant anxiety. She's not alone. She's in Canada and hasn't been eligible to get vaccinated yet but plans to because it's supposed to help alleviate the symptoms. 

So if you get the vaccine, then at worst you'll have a rough time for a few days. It's not 100% effective but it's nearly 100% effective at keeping people out of the hospital or from having an otherwise serious case. A year from now you won't be like my friend and so many others who are still coping with having Covid. You'll be free. So do this for yourself. 

Tip: After the shot try to move your arm you got it around to help minimize soreness. I did yoga and painted and it helped. Have Tylenol on hand in case you need it, but be sure to not overdo taking it.",ngsonf,2021-05-20 07:57:26
You can take tylenol after the shot of you need to which should bring any fever down.,ngsonf,2021-05-20 09:20:45
"Hey friend!
I can understand your worry.
But what I want to mention is you'll be fine. Just like you've accomplished so many hurdles till now, you'll get through this as well.
And I agree, ""man don't feel the pain"" things are ridiculous. You're a human being. Your fear, anxiety, happiness, sadness all of the emotions make you more of a human. Get your vaccine and post your experience soon to let us know how you conquer over your fear :)",ngsonf,2021-05-20 12:08:00
"For me when I get a fever, my forehead feels warm, and if I take a drink of something from a glass cup, my exhaled breath will heavily fog up the inside of the glass but the fog will linger longer than a typical exhaled breath fog on glass stays, if this makes any sense whatsoever. I also feel like my energy is being sapped from me and I tend to get chills. Honestly, keep some Advil on hand and take a day or two off if you can. I got my first Pfizer dose today and so far, things are turning out pretty good.

Keep a few comfort things like favourite clothes, blankets, food on hand just in case. “Manning up” is bullshit anyway. You are a man regardless of how you react or handle this and having anxiety doesn’t make you “less of a man”. It means you’re human and you’re alive.

Now then, deep breaths, break down if you need to, go get your shot, then immediately go get yourself a little treat once you’ve gotten the ok to leave. Positive reenforcement helps with anxiety I find.

I’m cheering for you!❤️",ngsonf,2021-05-20 08:16:46
"I'm not going to gaslight your anxiety, because it is yours and it's real to you.

What I will tell you is, though, is when you're anxious about something, it's typical to focus and dwell on the negatives.  And considering people that have experienced adverse reactions are more vocal than those who haven't, it's easy to do that.  After all, a social media post or article about fevers and body aches gets more views and likes than the millions of people who experienced none.

Let me tell you, my son (16) and I are now fully vaccinated with Pfizer and neither of us experienced so much as a fever on either dose.  We had pain at the injection site for a day after, and that's it.  This is what's typical.

My son was also quite anxious leading up to his appointment, and what helped him (aisde from asking me how I felt after mine) was focusing on keeping an ice pack on his arm until right before the shot.

I'm sure all will be well.  Congratulations on conquering  your anxiety in order to protect yourself and others from what's truly dangerous: SARS-COV-2.",ngsonf,2021-05-20 13:12:59
"My entire family got vaccinated and none of us had a fever. If you get a fever, tylenol and a semi cold wash cloth on your forehead should help! 

Also, I didnt feel either shots.",ngsonf,2021-05-20 16:49:16
"So I had my Pfizer 1st dose today at 11:20 (7 hours ago now) 

I so far feel completely normal, I was waiting for the “sharp scratch” of the needle but I did not feel anything at all, I have had countless blood tests in the past so was just waiting for that “sharp scratch” but this was the first ever time I have never felt a needle haha.

I promise to report tomorrow morning how I feel too, so it has been more time since having the vaccine.

Take care everyone.",ngsonf,2021-05-21 18:25:44
"The first shot was ezpz for me.

The second gave me a pretty hellish, sleepless night. I don't believe I had a fever but I did have hardcore chills, fatigue, body aches, and I couldn't sleep all night. It was rough. That being said, the next day was about 50% better. By night time I was putting together Ikea furniture with my girlfriend and I slept like a rock. And the day after that I was 85%. The next day 100%, which I've been ever since. And I just passed my two weeks from the second shot which means I'm fully vaxxed. Feels fucking amazing! You will likely regret getting the shot during the second one (although some don't have any problems at all with it).

It will pass and you will be grateful. Just get it over with!",ngsonf,2021-05-20 10:46:51

"Everyone has written such thoughtful replies; all I can add is that both my parents and I got vaccinated and we are all doing great. I remember mom being a bit anxious about me getting a fever since my spring term finals are coming up soon. But similar to what she used to do before getting a flu shot, she made sure to call the nurse and bought Tylenol just in case I need after (no medications before) and made a hot bowl of soup :-) and my favorite foods! Turns out I didn’t develop a fever and neither did they. I had a sore arm the next day for a couple of hours and that was it. As others have said, you are SUPER BRAVE to share your anxiety with us. Hope my family’s experience helps you somewhat. I wish you all the best and in a few mins, will give you the silver award I have :-)!!! Would have given a gold if I had one! Take care!",ngsonf,2021-05-20 20:56:09
"I totally get what you’re saying- I was very nervous leading up to it and got my first dose yesterday (Pfizer at Walgreens). Was nervous sitting there afterwards as well. Pretty much just had a low grade headache all day afterwards that came and went slightly and was pretty constant. Sore arm. Didnt love it and don’t like the idea of getting another, but I did it and only did it for the reasons you listed. Hope you are feeling well after your jab!",ngsonf,2021-05-22 02:32:33
"Hello everyone, I hope you are all well, it has now been 34 hours since I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and I can honestly say that I am hugely relieved and happy to not feel like I dreaded to feel.

I have had zero symptoms apart from feeling tired, absolutely no other symptom, no fever, no headache etc, I have just felt tired. 

As you all have said, it has been 100% worth it and now I am definitely not worried about when I have my second (and possibly third as it’s being trialed at the moment) doses. I know there are more reports of getting symptoms from the second dose but I still will 100% be having it when it is my time.

Truly am relieved as well as surprised that my first dose has been pretty much unremarkable.

All the best to you all.",ngsonf,2021-05-22 21:12:50
"So sorry to hear how much and long your friend has been suffering. It’s very alarming how you mention the mental fuzziness and constant anxiety because well I have had social anxiety my entire life but for 2 years, I would say 6 months before COVID was confirmed present in the UK my anxiety turned completely physical. I 100% remember having the worst cough of my entire life back in December 2019, sorry I do apologise that I mentioned I haven’t been sick in 10 years, I had the terrible cough December 2019 and I couldn’t even get to the top of my road without feeling like I was suffocating. Cough lasted around 2 days but for literally 3 months I had this unusual out of breath feeling, it was just like I had been running all the time.

Anytime I go to emergency department because of my anxiety I always tell them how worried I am over my fast heart rate but when the breathless started I for once never complained about my fast heart rate, I kept telling them I have this really new weird thing where my breathing doesn’t feel right. Each time a doctor listened to my lungs I was told they were completely normal, I can even remember getting out of bed at night and being out of breath just walking to the bathroom, something definitely wasn’t right back then, but my breathing for me personally is back to normal it just took ages. Cough was extremely productive as we know not characteristic of the “dry cough” with COVID but I just don’t know. Some reports say COVID has been in the UK long before other professions are saying from like December 31st.

I’ve been to emergency department I am not exaggerating I would say 70 times over the last 2 years, I have had every test under the sun and they can’t find nothing wrong with me, but my body has never felt the same as it did 2 years ago.

I don’t know if I had it or not sorry but yes definitely I will continue to avoid mixing people etc etc, it is very sad and bad what has happened with the world, I keep wishing it will be over, one day we have good news, the next day we have bad, I just hope the vaccines protect everyone. 

The worst thing for me to deal with are selfish people who are in complete denial, ones who think it doesn’t exist, others just saying it’s a minor flu, then ones who care more to go get drunk in a pub. Can’t forget the nutcases who think the vaccines are made by Bill Gates to track us or something lmao, and that it is “5G”

"No doubt you can do this. Most US states are vaccinating people no questions asked, so you should be able just to walk in and get your second dose.

The only problem I foresee is with record keeping. If at some point provincial/state/national vaccine databases start to be linked up and standardised, which may be necessary in the long term to enable 'vaccine passports' for travel, then having one dose in one country and a second dose in another country may create a bureaucratic problem. You're likely to have two different certificates, linked to two different databases, and that could potentially be a bit of a headache one day.

Nevertheless, the most important thing is to be physically protected, so I'd certainly recommend going ahead with it. When you return to Canada you may be able to persuade the health service to update your records to include the 2nd dose you received in the US.",ng6j25,2021-05-19 15:15:20
Yes you should be able to do there is lots of booking availability @ pharmacies/ vaccine centers. You can book in advance too. I just took my insurance details and proof of address for the US state. They give you a vaccine card for your records too.,ng6j25,2021-05-19 19:21:48
"I have the same question. Record keeping seems really important though, as various freedoms become available only to the fully vaccinated. Does anyone know if we can convince the American vaccinators to validate that they are giving you your second dose?",ng6j25,2021-05-20 09:45:36
"Thank you for this, I was stressing so much. I think like you said the bureaucracy is the main issue but being vaccinated seems more important now.

"Yes, they were able to get it earlier, and many did. There is definitely not a shortage of vaccines. There were 12 sites near me all with same day appointments when I got my shot yesterday. Anyone 12+ who wants the vaccine in my state, 110% has the ability to get it. I think the main different is you guys are relying on outside shipments, but America is producing large quantities of the vaccine right here so we get it faster.",nfvx4y,2021-05-19 08:39:37
"The states that did it by age did a much better job reaching those communities. My state had a big focus on equity and it really confused people and kept them away. The most vulnerable were also the most likely afraid to show up and get turned away. Also, less likely to have proof of their eligibility.

The states that did it by age did a much better job reaching those communities quickly. Vaccines sat in storage in a lot of areas because the qualifying criteria seemed simple on its surface, but was anything but. Like, they said disabled people could get it. What does that mean? I knew a lot of people who I would consider disabled who stayed away because they didn't feel disabled enough. Even when the state clarified it, it still didn't list every disability out there, so people stayed home.

Setting up pop up vaccine clinics in churches and community centers in my state made a big difference. Counties were driving the vaccine out to orchards to vaccinate migrant workers.",nfvx4y,2021-05-19 19:11:27
"In California, the elderly and immunocompromised people were the only ones eligible to get it at first. Then it became a younger age group, and then again, another younger age group. So our state made sure to have all the vaccines available for the elderly and immunocompromised first before anyone else was eligible.",nfvx4y,2021-05-20 16:51:17
"We are starting to make it here too. But yes, mostly relying on shipments.

Interesting,nfvx4y,2021-05-20 01:57:02
"The shots are free regardless of insurance. We've used a tier/priority system starting with front line medical workers and first responders and those most at risk for serious disease sick as the elderly, those living in congregate settings, etc. Currently there is enough vaccine for anyone who wants it so it's open to all (except children under the age the vaccine is approved for).

There is still disparity in vaccination rates in different communities but there has been an emphasis on making vaccine available to everyone, in every neighborhood and community. We have mobile vaccination, community popup clinics, mass vaccination sites, pharmacies giving the vaccine, etc. Most on a walk in basis now.",nfvx4y,2021-05-19 13:29:34
"So can’t speak for all the US but when I went to get my jabs there was no need to show my face insurance information at all. Walked in, gave my name, got my jab, sat for 20 minutes and left. ( note the only “problem” I see with this is that my immunization is not tied to my medical record requiring me to not lose my vaccination prep card ) 

The biggest problem for poor and disadvantaged in this case is access - time off work to get immunized, ability to get to the drug store/ hospital/ clinic to get immunized. 

My state (PA) is opening clinics in Multiple popular locations. And the local hospital is holding a clinic at the local high school before school pit for summer so they are trying to get everybody. 

And in some places Ride shares are giving free rides to clinics 

I think we’re trying to get everyone access",nfvx4y,2021-05-19 13:26:11
"Federal government pays the cost for the vaccine, so it is free to anyone receiving it. If you have health insurance, they may bill it to cover the cost of the vaccine administration labor, but none of those fees are paid by the patient.",nfvx4y,2021-05-19 13:41:19
"It was. People bragged about waiting until everyone was eligible even though they could have technically gotten it earlier. They felt like they saved it for the truly disabled people, when all it did was sit on a shelf as case rates went higher and higher.",nfvx4y,2021-05-20 02:54:01

In and out pretty quick. You'll feel the prick of the needle but it's maybe 5 sec max. It's all in your head. I'm the same way. Getting blood tests (not finger prick but actual vials) makes me light headed/faint. Maybe just let the person administering know that you are anxious about it.

Yes, it's in the shoulder, not the forearm.

No, there is no possibility you'd need to get pricked twice.

You won't need numbing cream, as the injection itself is essentially painless. Some people experience soreness at the injection site, but this usually starts several hours later, and it's in the muscle, not on the skin, so numbing cream wouldn't really help.

Well done for plucking up the courage to do this. Just remember not to look at the needle, and to look away when they're giving you the jab. Drink plenty of water beforehand and afterward, and you'll be fine.",nfg6hz,2021-05-18 19:14:56

"when comparing the three vaccines to one another, Fauci says it cannot be done because there has been no research comparing the vaccines ""head-to-head.""

""So, be careful when you try to parse these, this percent versus that. The only way you know one versus the other, if you compare them head-to-head, and they were not compared head-to-head,"" Fauci said

"My husband felt a little nauseous and warm for a 3-4 hours but nothing too terrible. It knocked me on my ass for about 8 hours with a fever, chills and body aches, but then I felt fine. I’m guessing if I reacted like that to the shot I would have had a very unpleasant case if I got COVID...so in my view better to get it over with in 8 hours! It was tolerable, but I would have been pretty miserable if I had to be at work during that time. I’m glad I got it and would totally get it again!",newbgy,2021-05-18 13:49:47
"Also the j and j was tested after the others, and after the variants appeared, so it’s like comparing apples to oranges.

But you can still compare them.",newbgy,2021-05-18 13:53:09
Right but j and j was tested once there were variants and the others were tested against the one strain. So it’s not really an equal comparison. If you retested the others now in the same way we’d likely get different results.,newbgy,2021-05-18 13:55:13
"When I had the virus I was sick for a day or two, and when I got the Pfizer vaccine the first one was just a sore arm for a few days and the second dose I had barely a sore arm I didn't notice it was sore unless I actively poked at the injection site, I know not every ones like this but that was my experience",neyxzu,2021-05-18 13:59:00
This happened to a family member of mine. He had covid last summer. He had pretty harsh side effects with both shots. He said it was 100% worth it. The vaccine side effects were 2 days long vs his 4 weeks covid stint which resulted in hospitalization.,neyxzu,2021-05-18 16:30:47
"They don't say that they 'definitely can't' have these effects. What they say (from the link you posted) is:

> There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems. However, data are limited about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people who are pregnant. 

In science, we don't say anything is 'definitely' true or not true. What we say is that we currently have evidence for or against something. Right now, there is no evidence to suggest any harm to pregnant women. There is abundant evidence showing the harm that Covid does to pregnant women. So on the balance of the current evidence, you should get a Covid vaccine. However, as the CDC says, we are constantly trying to gather more evidence, and if evidence to the contrary does surface, the science will have to be revised.",nedshd,2021-05-17 13:55:30

"Monitoring is ongoing for all vaccines—the monitoring is increased for COVID because of the situation, but monitoring for events does not mean anyone thinks it is a risk. 

They have used VSAFE and VAERS to show that the risks of any of these outcomes are NOT increased in those who receive the vaccine during pregnancy—or, put another way, that there is no evidence of increased risk.

"Thanks for the paper that was informative. 

Seems to me there are saying you are better off receiving the vaccine in third trimester to be sure as they couldn’t determine whether the vaccine was the cause of the miscarriages in the first trimester as the number to pre COVID miscarriages in first trimester were ‘similar’. They did however link a paper that was studying miscarriages caused by the vaccine in first trimester during the 2009 flu outbreak... to me that would suggest they were indicating that it would be better off to wait until you are closer to the 3rd trimester to get the vaccine? 

Maybe I’ve understood that wrong but that’s what I got from it.",nedshd,2021-05-17 21:50:57
Excellent 😂,nedshd,2021-05-18 00:55:21
"Given the rates of miscarriage were similar (ie, there was not a statistically significant difference), no relationship between a vaccine and miscarriage has been noted. This was also examined for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, but I don’t think a relationship was shown there either.

The risk of waiting is that a pregnant woman gets COVID in the meantime—which does have significant risks, and pregnancy increases those risks. 

But for an individual situation, this is also a discussion for an OBGYN—the data shows no relationship between the vaccine and any adverse health outcome for mom or baby.",nedshd,2021-05-17 22:04:35
"And yet many doctors have made the exact opposite decision, including my sister and several friends of mine (if we're going by anecdotal evidence). The decision they made was that their job exposes them to a high risk of Covid on a daily basis, which is a far higher risk to them and the baby than any unknown risk from vaccines.

My sister has just given birth to a very healthy and happy baby boy, by the way.",nedshd,2021-05-18 02:33:44

If there’s still a legal requirement to wear masks outdoors where you are then yeah, do that. All states should be re-evaluating their orders in light of the new guidance but it’s going to take some time for people to get comfortable with the idea.

"1. No. Evidence suggests that the vaccine reduces your chance of catching covid by around 85%.

Source: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399

Moreover, people who have had one dose of the vaccine but catch covid anyway are approximately 50% less likely to transmit the virus to other people, compared to people who haven’t had any vaccine.

2. I’m sure that you will always be free to politely decline the vaccine. However, I think it’s likely that being unvaccinated would prevent you from doing certain things. For example, pub/restaurant owners could refuse unvaccinated people. The government could ban unvaccinated people from attending gatherings such as concerts, festivals and events. Foreign governments could ban unvaccinated people from visiting their country.

3. It’s not mandatory. I don’t think that you can “become exempt”, but you could just ignore invitations offering you the vaccine if you felt that way inclined.

"The 95% figure comes from the initial Pfizer trials. In those studies, individuals who were vaccinated were 95% less likely to test positive for covid, compared to unvaccinated individuals. 

Just because they were 95% less likely to test positive, it doesn’t necessary mean that they were 95% less likely to get infected. It could have been the case that some of the study participants caught covid but didn’t get tested because they were asymptomatic.",ndk1u8,2021-05-16 10:27:26

In particular they did a [study of US healthcare workers](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w) where they did PCR tests weekly and found the mRNA vaccines were 90% effective at preventing people from testing positive.

"Whether is a therapeutic effect of the drug or an adverse effect, the effects of the drug are limited by how long it stays in the body. The vaccine and the inactive ingredients that preserve it and allow it to be an injection are out of your system within a short period of time. You can’t have long term effects if the drug isn’t in the system anymore. 
The only thing that persists is the immune reaction. If you’re going to have a reaction to the vaccine it can only be in the short term. 
Not to mention you’ve most likely had multiple vaccines in the past and were totally fine. At this point the data behind the vaccines is very solid.

"You sound thoroughly misinformed lol. The trials for this vaccine were just as long as any other vaccine. It was the paperwork between each trial that was moved forward to complete the process quicker. Masks are highly effective and do help. You’re just lucky lol. I mean you can choose to get information from doctors pushing pseudo-science if you want. But I think it’s important you follow reliable sources such as CDC, NIH, WHO. Here are a few sources >

Also MRNA vaccines have been studied for years, but we’ve never had the funding to implement this technology in humans before, nor have we had a demand. 

“mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.” —CDC 

There has been a global effort to pool resources in order to accelerate the development and production of vaccines 

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/accelerating-a-safe-and-effective-covid-19-vaccine

Also what you’re referring to when you say it won’t end until 2023 is the safety and monitoring stage of the phase III trial. This is standard practice for ANY vaccine. They monitor it heavily for any safety issues with it. 

“This means that “all trial participants will continue to be monitored to assess long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose” -Duke University.

Where I came from, there is a saying, ""There is no shame in avoiding a charging, angry, big elephant.""  For you, I advise you to treat the Covid as a charging, angry, big elephant.

That’s why they tell you to stay 30 minutes not 15 if you say you have reacted to anything in the past.  Both Pfizer and Moderna use PEG as one of the four lipids in their lipidnanoparticle.

"That's not all. In many countries, the standard every 10 years is not TDaP, but TDP (tetanus, diphtheria and polio). And on top of that, you can get TDPP (tetanus, diphtheria, polio and pertussis). There's no particular reason not to get as many as you can at once, apart from cost, availability, and perhaps allergic reactions in a small number of individuals.",naviey,2021-05-12 19:44:34
"Ugh this makes me want to get the TDPP now, but it looks like it's not available in the US.  Haha it's probably unnecessary since there hasn't been a case of polio here since 1979.  

Thank you for this: I'll make sure I get the TDAP today and not just the TD booster.  I'm worried because the option when I was scheduling my appointment with the Kroger pharmacy said 'TD/TDAP,' not letting me specify, so I hope it won't just be whatever they have on hand.",naviey,2021-05-12 20:00:26
"The primary purpose for the TDaP in adults is to protect infants who have not completed their primary sequence of pertussis vaccination.   Babies are not going to get Pertussis from other children, it going to be from adults whose immunity wained years if not decades ago.   Pertussis infections are much more common in adults than realized.  In adults it is not serious at all and is an annoying cough (quite nondescript) often not prompting a visit to a doctor and often misdiagnosed if you do go, but you get better anyway.  Not so for a newborn to 5 month old baby who may have had no vaccine or at the most 2 shots which is less than half the primary sequence number of shots for this.  These babies get a harsh whooping cough with gasping respirations often needing pediatric icu care. So if your around babies a lot probably not a bad idea to get a TDaP every 7-10.  If your not just get DT",naviey,2021-05-12 22:38:42
"Edit: misspoke and confused brand names - I take back this statement about Td. 

And TDPP is available in the US for kids ( as are a few penta and hexa valent pediatric products )

Most adults don’t need boosters of polio, HiB etc so the combos don’t exist cause they don’t sell a lot ( it sucks to make a million doses of something that only 1000 people a year need, that’s a lot of product loss for relatively small profit in a group that aren’t majorly impacted by multiple jabs - I know there’s a lot of qualifiers in that sentence) but also licensing combo vaccines is hard",naviey,2021-05-12 21:47:35
"Haha when I hear about getting extra immunity, it's tempting, but I have to remind myself that nobody's gotten polio in the US for 40 years. I guess they decided protection against it wasn't worth the extra cost and slightly increased risk of reactions for adults.",naviey,2021-05-12 22:05:07

"The idea of a vaccine is to elicit a strong immune response to cultivate antibodies for when you are exposed to the virus at full strength. Some people have a more extreme response to vaccines than others. The severity of your reaction is not a correlation with how your body would handle a full infection though. Every immune response we have is to a degree unique, and a vaccine is done with a controlled effect. It's like asking someone to paint a picture with brand new tools versus their bare hands. You're gonna get different paintings in the end, but the tools are likely to get a much more desired result. If you were to repeat this a hundred times, you'll get a hundred different results each time. It's not the greatest example, but just like there are hundreds of variables that can affect a painting, there are many more variables on how an immune response will be felt by you. What you ate, how much sleep you got, what viruses you've been exposed too recently, what vitamins you take, all of these things and many many more can change the way your body will respond. I used to always have a mild reaction to the flu vaccine, but as I've gotten older my reactions have become less common. I did have a strong reaction to the J&J vaccine, but it was over within a day, which I expected based on my prior reactions, but I wasn't sure if I would because the flu vaccine hasn't given me trouble in a long time. So to circle back and answer your q's directly, no, neither a lack of or presence of a response gives an accurate indication of whether you've been exposed or what severity the actual disease would cause you. It's just the way your body reacted to the presence of the weakened viral introduction combined with other factors that may have impacted you prior to the vaccine.",naiomf,2021-05-12 15:25:09
"Side effects are just your body's response to the shot and building up immunity. Everyone that I've talked to that had covid and got the vaccine, seems to have had stronger side effects to the vaccine.",naiomf,2021-05-13 15:28:38

"Even in longer vaccine development tracks, it’s not like there is more time spent on monitoring long term side effects. Because history shows that these are extremely rare for vaccines. Any possible serious side effects usually show up in a matter of weeks, rather than a couple of years or decades (rare J&J blood clotting for instance). The vaccine itself trains your immune system, and after a few weeks no traces of the vaccine are left in your body anymore. This is why any long term side effects are extremely unlikely. The complete truth is, can it be entirely ruled out? Perhaps not. But then again, there is no reason to assume it will occur.

"Pharmacodynamics, which is the study of what compounds do the body, essentially relies entirely on effects occurring within the initial period of introduction to the host, or in the immediate period following. 

As discussed in the article, well over 95% of adverse reactions to compounds of any sort occur within the first 72 hours post administration. After such a time it’s very difficult to gather any reliable data to suggest the compound in question was causative in nature. 

Two months following the administration of a vaccine the compounds are all long cleared from the system. At that time you have also statistically surpassed the majority of events likely to be caused by a vaccine. Once the constituents of a vaccine are cleared from the body, there can be no new reactions to those compounds and so the likelihood of any affect, long or short term is reduced significantly.",n8y42d,2021-05-10 15:32:18
"There’s no evidence immunity to one strain of covid would make you unable to fight off future variants. In fact the opposite is true, immunity to one covid variant provides protection against others but at reduced levels.

"At nine days, he is essentially unprotected or very slightly protected. Strong protection starts a few days later. If he was infected a few days ago, that's worse. But given about a week from now, he'll have much stronger defences. Sufficient protection to avoid the most drastic outcomes (hospitalization, death) should start within the next five days.

In studies on the topic (which aren't as numerous or detailed as we'd like atm, but getting there) essentially no strong protection of any kind has been noted prior to 11 days after the first dose. Between 11 and 14 days, some studies noted protection was detectable, while others didn't look closely enough to be able to discern much. At least one has not detected anything on day 11 in any patients. But essentially all have found strong protection starts at least at day 14, and increases steadily the following days, peaking about two weeks later (after the second dose, if one is administered, or about a week earlier if only one dose is received).",n8lny3,2021-05-10 05:23:56
"They say two weeks following the second shot is when immunity peaks. Most of the research says that the first shot offers about 80% immunity, but every person is different.",n8lny3,2021-05-09 21:14:07
"He would have some protection - not a lot, but some. We don’t know the actual numbers yet because we are quite literally in the middle of things still. At 2 weeks post 2nd dose it’s looking like he would have at least 95% immunity based on the research we have available.

To give an example of another vaccination that is 2 doses that we do have better numbers on that I’ve done work on: the first dose of the Hepatitis A vaccine gives you immunity up for at least a decade of a good 75%-95% protection whereas adding that second dose will cover the rest of that 76%-99.999% for at least another 15 years, hopefully life. 

However, it is possible that vaccines do not take to everyone nor do they stick around in your system forever - essentially your body forgets the code, because your cells replace every on average every 7 years. I’m one of those people, I get to go through the whole set of vaccines every decade now, once we discovered that.

As an Epidemiologist I would say isolate yourself as best you can within your house, wipe down any surfaces you touch especially in the bathroom, wear masks when you are in the same room, and wait at least a week from your symptoms starting for him to get PCR tested. It should not come up positive just because he has the vaccine, but the antibody test would show a positive.

Almost certainly not.  Vaccine reactions occur within 6-8 weeks,n8dzfk,2021-05-09 15:22:06
"Thanks for commenting, but can you clarify your comment?

Do you mean:

1. Vaccine reactions occur between the time of injection and ~7 weeks, or

2. Vaccine reactions occur between weeks 6 and 8 after the time of injection

?",n8dzfk,2021-05-09 15:58:01
"They don’t occur after 6-8 weeks.  They can occur any time from a few minutes after the injection to a few weeks out.  3mo is too long.  By then, the immune response has long since matured and the inflammation will have died down.  The ingredients of the injection would have been eliminated from the body after a few weeks at most.

Moreover, the tetanus vaccine is one of the oldest vaccines in use, introduced in 1924.  Almost every human who has lived in the last century has received multiple doses. I think that this kind of reaction would have been described by now if it were caused by the vaccine.

There are many causes of joint pain and crepitus that have nothing to do with vaccines.  I’d suggest getting a professional medical opinion.",n8dzfk,2021-05-09 16:43:11

The Moderna/Pfizer vaccine dose not give you a part of the virus.,n7xhgm,2021-05-09 16:16:19
"That guy you know doesn’t understand Covid at all. They call it the “novel coronavirus” because there isn’t *anything* like it that our immune systems would have been exposed to in order to prepare for it. That guy with the great immune system has no defenses built up to withstand the effects of the virus. If he had some other underlying health condition, say high blood pressure, he could go splat during the treatment, but that’s not even why he should get the vaccine. He should get the vaccine so he doesn’t catch it and pass it on—the more times this virus changes hands, transfers to a new person, the more opportunities it has to mutate into something else that could be even worse.",n7xhgm,2021-05-12 00:42:27
"Exactly what Eli said. The vaccines do NOT have any part of a live virus in it. Do a lot of people recover? Sure. Can he be 100% sure it wont be him who gets a severe case? Nope. I know people, perfectly healthy, who got Covid and almost died and some did die. No thank you. 

My father in law has this same mind set. My father in law has sleep apnea and is slightly overweight. I just dont understand but it's not my body so it's not my choice.",n7xhgm,2021-05-09 16:45:31

There are risks with all medical interventions. That's why countries have organizations like the FDA, to through a rigorous, lengthy and clearly bureaucratic process establish the safety of new drugs.

So let’s say that one of you does get infected, anyway.  And let’s just say that the vaccines don’t reduce your risk of transmitting once you are infected (they do), then all your band mates have a 95% reduced chance of being infected.  So what’s 5% of 5%?  0.25%.  So the risk that you will bring COVID into your band practice *AND* give it to a band mate is now 0.25% of what it was before you were all ~~infected~~ vaccinated.  Even with five band mates the risk only rises to 1% of what it was before you were vaccinated.

This is a pretty low risk.

(And I’m not a statistician so if I got it wrong, please educate me).

"The simplified idea is this: when a virus gets in your body it needs to replicate many, many times. If your body has never seen the virus, the virus can replicate before getting ""caught"" by your immune system. If it can replicate, there's now enough virus in your body that when you cough/sneeze/breath/speak/sing/etc, it can travel out into the world around you. When that virus finds another person, it gets into *their* body and the process repeats. 

Vaccination means that your body recognizes the virus pretty quickly. As soon as some of the virus gets in your body, your immune system will get rid of it and it can't replicate very much. So you just don't have enough virus floating around to really jump to another person.

That's why 2 vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask. If one of you happens to be carrying the virus, they *probably* don't have enough virus in them to pass it on. And even if they're one of the unlucky ones and are still contagious (since the vaccine isn't 100% perfect, it can happen), it's likely that the person they're hanging out with has some immunity and won't get sick/contagious.",n4d1gv,2021-05-04 06:34:53

"If everyone is vaccinated then go for it. Look, we can’t live in fear forever. Once I, my family, and my SO get our second shot and wait 2 weeks, I’m living my normal life. I’ll still wear a mask in Walmart just so I don’t look like an asshole, but other than that I’m returning to normal. If you’re all vaccinated what’s the point of a mask? Your odds go down to like .2% of someone getting sick from you if you’re both vaccinated. And even if they get sick it’ll be the same as getting a cold. Almost 0% chance of getting hospitalized. 

So at some point we have to move on. We can’t wear a mask forever being afraid of the flu basically (not saying covid is the flu. Saying covid with the vaccine is comparable to that at worst). 

So yes. Get your second shot, wait 2 weeks, and then enjoy the company of your friends",n4d1gv,2021-05-05 01:08:48
Honestly I haven't wore a mask in doors with family because we've all been tested and vaccinated. I wear a mask in doors only if i am at a store or am with random people. I still have to do that unless told otherwise. I have to follow store policies. Nothing really changed. Yesterday I got questioned as to why I wasn't wearing a mask outside as well and I had to explain to the person that I didn't have to because I was vaccinated.

"23 Male - Moderna 

Got my shot yesterday, fine afterwards. After the 12th hour I felt like the feeling you get right before a cold is about to hit you hard. So I went to bed, and woke up around 1 AM shaking a bit with chills, body aches, and a fever of 99.7. Other than that, it feels pretty mild and it feels like it’s already calming down right now. it’s 2 AM and I can’t sleep, but I will say I am very glad I got the shot. I’m wondering if symptoms continue much into the 2nd day. 

One thing I find interesting, is that I could actually gauge how hard it was going to hit me, as the symptoms increased. 

Tip: I drank lots and lots of water, maybe 100 oz and ate a very clean diet. Almonds, oranges, blueberries, eggs. (Most anti-inflammatory foods.) I hear this really helps, but I couldn’t say if it actually minimizes symptoms.",n44ljd,2021-05-06 07:42:06

Had my first dose Saturday-super sore arm for two days (like I did a really good arm workout).  Initially I felt ‘jacked’ like I had a B12 shot—I don’t know if it was psychosomatic, or whether I was just SO HAPPY to get the vaccine started?  I have never had the flu shot, so this process was all new.

I worked out Saturday and Sunday  (asked nurse about that, and movement was recommended).  I could feel some tenderness, but kept going...today lifting was no issue.  

I felt a bit foggy in my brain on Monday, but other than that it has been ok. 

I joined the Moderna sub because I am interested in the 2nd shot reactions (I am scheduled for August...Canada...sigh).

Hope all is well with everyone who is getting the Moderna vaccine—let’s get this done, and get going!",n0j5jp,2021-04-28 20:44:55
"My aunt and I both got the Moderna vaccine. Both of us had no reaction to the first shot except a sore arm. The second shot for her was no big deal, just a massive headache. 

For me, the second shot was horrendous. Got the shot at 0900. Felt fine all day, left work at 1300 because they warned me side effects could show up between 5-8 hours and I did NOT want to be stuck at work. Grab some Tylenol on the way home, feeling fine, just tired. By 1700 a headache started coming on and I was exhausted. By 1800 it felt like I got hit by a truck and I started getting a fever/chills. Took my ass to bed, probably didn’t get more than three hours a sleep and not cumulatively. Fever and chills almost all through the night as well as some weird skin sensitivity, like the blanket actually hurt resting on my skin. My muscles were very sore and my body overall just felt like I was recovering from some horrible illness. I took the Tylenol every 4-6 hours and it helped the headache (which is fine because I can deal with the rest). By the next morning I was completely fine, though the body fatigue didn’t go away until maybe 3-4 days after. It’s been three weeks and I’m not gonna lie, my body is still feeling fatigued but I’m getting through it. 

Long story short, you just can’t predict it and it’s better than being seriously ill with COVID and infecting people with it. Also, stock up on Tylenol 8 hour for Muscle Aches and Pain.",n0j5jp,2021-04-29 10:52:44

"***The rollout has picked up speed significantly in recent weeks.*** Official figures show *23.4% of the population had received at least one dose of vaccine by Sunday and about 7.2% of Germany’s 83 million inhabitants had received both shots*.

After supply problems and concerns over efficacy and rare blood clots involving the AstraZeneca vaccine, Germany has relied heavily on the shots made by local company BioNTech and its U.S. partner Pfizer. About 50 million doses of that vaccine are expected to be delivered in the second quarter, Merkel said.

She and the governors also discussed whether people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should be exempt from restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the virus, though no decision was made.

The issue of special privileges for vaccinated people has been hotly debated in Germany, as in other countries. Some in Germany have argued it's unfair on those who haven't been able to get the shot yet. Others say restrictions on civil liberties are justified while people pose a risk to others.

Merkel cited a recent report from Germany's disease control agency, which concluded that people pose “no relevant risk” to others 14 days after they've received a second dose of vaccine. This would mean that they could be treated like people who test negative for the coronavirus or who have recovered from infection.",n0ex0c,2021-04-28 14:41:41

"Based on vaccine dose volume, I would say that Pfizer is the least painful. It has 0.3 mL of fluid per injection, while Moderna and JnJ both have 0.5mL of fluid per injection. Thus, less substance is being pumped into your arm and the needle needs less time to administer the dose. 

I don’t know if that actually makes it less painful, but that makes sense to me as a biology student.

"Hi ! 

1.My video is not aimed at children or I don't understand what you mean by that :)) 

The vaccines are not approved for child use. I read that Pfizer will be for kids 12-15 years old in the near future, we don't know for sure. I didn't read the studies that enrolled children.

&#x200B;

2. You are currently trying to have a baby - does she/you take any medicine to help you with the conceiving ? I am not a gynecologist to give you a correct answer, from what I read, from the results of the studies, the vaccines don't have enough data for pregnant women and the opinion of the doctors are 50%-50%, no one knows for sure. 

From my personal point of view, one of the reasons I vaccinated was because in the near future I want to have a baby and I don't want to get infected during pregnancy (9 whole months of risk). Here we have enough data to tell that this situation could be tragic. 

&#x200B;

3. I personally don't think they are related. Unfortunately, the rate of placental abruption overall is 0.4-1% and miscarriages 10% to 20% (higher - 30-50% if you have fertilisation) and depend on several number of factors. It could happen with or without the vaccine. I hope I don't sound like I don't care, I do care and I am scared myself of this percentage in the general population. 

&#x200B;

4. I have bigger concerns about the long term effects of getting infected than the long term effects of the vaccine. I personally think the mRNA vaccines will be used more in the future (I don't yet have an opinion about the viral vector ones). Unfortunately, I see many cases nowadays, at younger age, much more severe and deadly than last year. I have friends, young and no comorbidities with plenty of sequelae after the disease, although they didn't need hospitalization for the disease. Search about the groups - long hauler covid/ long haulers etc 

&#x200B;

5. I don't have the answer about vaccination of the children and this is a problem you will have a better answer when your child will be born. First of all, you have to vaccinate the baby against measles, mumps, diphtheria etc , then think about vaccinating against covid. 

&#x200B;

6. I cannot compare vaccines because the trials were made in different periods, with different circulating variants, with different number of people and different areas of the world. I don't think one vaccine is better that the other, I cannot compare them. 

&#x200B;

7. The overall rate of SIDS reported by CDC is 35.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018. CDC says the other vaccines were investigated and don't cause SIDS. [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/sids.html#rel](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/sids.html#rel) here you will find the studies. 

The reality is that vaccines - any kind of vaccine - induce an immune response that is far less aggressive than the disease itself. Our bodies react in different ways and to know for sure how, we all would have to do genetic typing and immunological studies - to find out exactly how our body will react. 

But keep in mind that many many drugs we take have side effects that can be lethal at normal doses. 

&#x200B;

I personally have faith in this vaccines. The decision is personal, based on the balance risk - benefit both on being infected and on vaccinating.

Stay safe!",mznge9,2021-04-28 15:50:21

"Polio is spread via feces, usually through contaminated water or soil and hand-to-mouth contact. Children aren't great at avoiding getting dirty or putting their fingers in their mouths.

Also, most cases of polio -- iirc, 95% -- have no or few symptoms. You can get polio and not even know you've had it. Before the vaccine, most people contracted polio before age 5 and were thereafter immune. Some of the people who contracted it, however, had serious symptoms like paralysis. Over age 5, most people had already had polio.

Okay, this part I'm not sure I'm remembering/describing correctly:

The polio epidemic in the US started in the early 1900s and peaked in the 1950s, around the same time that water sanitation improved. This meant that children were contracting polio later than they had in previous generations. Previous generations contracted polio when they were babies and still had some immunity from their moms. Also during these decades, doctors were starting to discourage women from breastfeeding. Babies used to get some immunity from their mothers' milk, so breastfeeding helped make infant cases of polio more mild.",mzilb3,2021-04-27 08:40:04

If she believes the ingredients in the covid vaccines can cause infertility, warn her to avoid all of these because they contain the same ingredients:

Potassium chloride – To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Never use or handle fertilizer or eat root vegetables grown in fertilizer like potatoes or carrots – the majority of this salt produced is used to make fertilizer. Don’t take it by mouth – they give tablets of it people to treat low potassium. Check all ingredients lists on processed foods, where it’s used as a preservative or low-sodium alternative to regular table salt. Check all ingredients lists on bath products, cleansing products, eye makeup, skin care products, personal cleanliness products, and shampoo or hair care products, where it’s also used as a preservative.

Monobasic potassium phosphate – To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Never use or handle fertilizer or eat root vegetables grown in fertilizer like potatoes or carrots – it’s used in fertilizer. Don’t take itby mouth – they give it to people to reduce calcium kidney stones, treat high-ammonia urine, and improve the efficacy of antibiotics for bladder infections or UTIs. It’s also used as a food additive and fungicide.

Sodium chloride (the table salt you keep in your kitchen)

Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate – To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Never drink or bake with condensed milk (it’s used to prevent coagulation). Don’t use powdered or granular food products (it’s used as an anti-caking agent). Don’t eat Cream of Wheat or instant pudding (it’s used as a thickener). Check your detergents and cleaning products for this ingredient. Don’t take it when you’re constipated or preparing for a colonscopy (it’s given as a laxative).

Sucrose (the sugar, actually made from sugar cane, that you keep in your kitchen)

Tromethamine and Tromethamine hydrochloride – To avoid these 2 ingredients, you’d have to: Never take one if it’s ever offered to you as a treatment for metabolic acidosis caused by something like gastroenteritis or kidney failure or after having heart bypass surgery or cardiac arrest.

Acetic acid (undiluted vinegar) -- To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Never work in or go to any place like a hospital where surfaces need sanitized – it’s used as an antiseptic. Don’t let them use it if you ever need to get screened for cervical cancer. Don’t eat condiments like mayonnaise, mustard, or ketchup, any seasoned food, or pickled food – it’s used in all of the above. Don’t eat or make fluffy baked goods – the puffiness comes from a reaction between baking soda and diluted acetic acid. Don’t use any of the numerous inks, dyes, rubbers, plastics, or perfumes where this is used as an ingredient. Don’t use vinegar to clean your house or laundry (a popular lifehack) or buy any commercial cleaning products that contain it.

Sodium acetate -- To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Never eat any seasoned food, especially salt and vinegar potato chips – this is what gives them that flavor. Don’t eat processed foods – it’s a widely used as a preservative to extend foods’ shelf life. Don’t use baking soda and vinegar together while baking, buy baked foods that contain them, or clean with baking soda and vinegar together (a common green cleaning strategy) – baking soda and vinegar (sodium bicarbonate and acetic acid) mixed together make sodium acetate.

Polysorbate-80 -- To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Carefully read the list of ingredients in any whipped cream, gelatin, shortening, condiments, sauces, gravy, ice cream, or any processed food, all of which it’s commonly found in. Make sure it’s not on the ingredients list of any soap, cosmetics, eyedrops, or mouthwash you use.

Citric acid monohydrate (the form you get when citric acid, the molecule that gives citrus fruits that citrusy flavor, is crystallized from cold water) – To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Never eat citrus fruits. Check that it’s not in your juice, soft drink, or sauce, where it’s widely added. Check that it’s not in your shampoo or facial mask, where it’s widely used.

Trisodium citrate dihydrate -- To avoid this ingredient, you’d have to: Never eat processed foods or beverages that use it as a popular emulsifier and preservative.

"I don't know about articles. But there's a really great podcast called ""Oh No Ross and Carrie"" that does a recent episode about vaccine hesitancy. They have a guest who has never had a vaccine before and is nervous talk to a doctor and ask all the same kinds of questions it looks like your looking to answer. If you're ok spending an hour and half listening to the podcast they do a really good job of giving information in a unbiased and non-judging way",my9egq,2021-04-25 15:36:01
"I’m just going to address the hesitancies your friend has outlined so that you have some responses for those for now.

Vaccines don’t “fiddle with your immune system”. They do exactly the same thing that getting any infection does to your immune system but with the added bonus of not having the dangerous bits of a virus or bacteria. All a vaccine is doing, is introducing a part of a virus or bacteria to your body so that it can build a response to it. 

I have no idea where he is getting any idea that you can get terribly sick from a common cold after vaccination and I have a suspicion that if you asked him to back that point up he would be entirely unable to do so. 

You’re looking at this point the wrong way around. How would it even be possible for anyone to get cancer from this particular vaccine? There are no plausible mechanisms by which this could occur. The vaccine is cleared from the system by the two month mark so anything after that is just your bodies immune response to the vaccine. Do we have data beyond two months worth? Yes absolutely. We also have millions of people now vaccinated and perfectly fine.",my9egq,2021-04-25 17:32:53
"It's difficult to persuade people that vaccinations are better than the virus. If you manage to convince them one thing, they'd come up with another. For example, blood clots - yes, some vaccines can cause them by one in a million, but covid-19 causes the same thing much more frequently. Just as you thought you've won the argument, they say ""but can you prove that vaccine doesn't cause sterility?"". I don't know - can you prove that it does?! But, it just goes on and on. 

I've still to find a way to talk to people effectively about this, because the target is always moving and I'm getting a feeling like we're talking about the wrong thing. It's not that they're concerned about specific thing, it's more that they're concerned in general - anxiety, stress from work, previous trauma in the family, feeling of being let down etc. This just reflects in vaccinations. 

It's a tedious process, but I feel everyone should take part because it's a responsible thing to do. Good luck with your friend!",my9egq,2021-04-25 20:22:28

Recognition of the PAMP is still the overriding mechanisms by which the antigen is encountered in the first case. There’s just a little more tagged into the initial stages following administration of the vaccine, the allow the transcript to enter host cells.

“RabAvert Rabies Vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline GmbH is a sterile, freeze-dried vaccine obtained by growing the fixed-virus strain Flury Low Egg Passage (LEP) in primary cultures of chicken fibroblasts. The strain Flury LEP was obtained from American Type Culture Collection as the 59th egg passage. The growth medium for propagation of the virus is a synthetic cell culture medium with the addition of human albumin, polygeline (processed bovine gelatin), and antibiotics. The virus is inactivated with β-propiolactone and further processed by zonal centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. The vaccine is lyophilized after addition of a stabilizer solution that consists of buffered polygeline and potassium glutamate. One dose of reconstituted vaccine contains ≤12 mg polygeline (processed bovine gelatin), ≤0.3 mg human serum albumin, 1 mg potassium glutamate, and 0.3 mg sodium EDTA. Small quantities of bovine serum are used in the cell culture process”

"Certain viruses mutate a lot. Influenza is one. Each year, with the flu vaccine, scientists analyze recent trends in flu infections and decide which flu strains go into that year's ""cocktail"" for the flu shot. Some years they guess very well, some years, not so much. 

There's a lot unknown still about covid-19 because it's such a new virus. Based on trends seen with other previous coronaviruses, and what we've seen so far from covid-19, it does appear to be a virus that will mutate a lot. People who are fully vaccinated against the original strain may or may not be protected fully against variants- it currently seems that the vaccine will still protect against very serious illness/hospitalization/death from the newer strains, though. 

I do think that we will see a scenario in which we'll need yearly boosters, same as we do with flu. Covid-19 will mutate, they'll come up with a booster for that mutation, then it'll mutate again, etc. I don't think this indicates a failure in the vaccines- it's just how this type of virus works. However, there's a lot of discussion about various scenarios simply because covid-19 is still so new that scientists just don't know for sure what to expect.",msqcyt,2021-04-17 14:27:31
I'm not sure I understand what everyone is up in arms about here. I fully expected to have to get a yearly covid shot like the flu shot for a while till we see how things fare. Is it the people afraid of needles that are both upset and shocked about this?,msqcyt,2021-04-17 23:34:28
"Yes, it will become a yearly thing like the flu shot, tweaked to target the strains likely to be circulating at the time.

I hope it doesn't cause the same fever and other symptoms every year like it did for me this time, but my symptoms were such I'll still consider it worth it, just annoying.",msqcyt,2021-04-17 23:51:25
Viruses mutate. It’s what they do. This is why it was so important to minimize it early. The US flubbed bigtime.,msqcyt,2021-04-17 20:12:09
I mean there is a huge difference between asking someone to get one or two vaccines and asking them to get one every year for the foreseeable future. Compliance will not be near as high as it is initially,msqcyt,2021-04-18 03:29:20
"I'm finding it hard to understand others on this one. I went to the doctor last year and basically asked for every vaccine I should have at my age and I kinda felt disappointed I only needed 1. I don't have polio, small pox, measels, mumps, etc. and there is a reason for this. 

If I have to get another yearly one then NBD.",msqcyt,2021-04-18 03:42:48
Maybe not on this sub but in general I feel like you’re definitely in the minority.,msqcyt,2021-04-18 03:47:13
"I hope you're wrong and it's just a vocal minority, but I may be wrong. As someone that has researched genealogy of my own family it's frightening how many people use die way before their time. We are so lucky to be where we are medically as a society and I don't want to go backwards.",msqcyt,2021-04-18 04:26:16
I don’t know what portion of people get flu vaccines yearly but I would guess it can’t be higher than 50%. The fear of COVID might convince a few more people but highly doubt it would be a large majority. I mean right now there is pretty much no issue getting an appointment where I am.,msqcyt,2021-04-18 14:07:31
It’s usually around 40-50%. In 2017 it was 37%. I’d be shocked if people got the covid vaccine yearly as much as they do the flu vaccine.,msqcyt,2021-04-19 18:16:48
I would actually think it would be a similar percentage as flu maybe even a little higher since people are more scared of COVID in general. But I also think some would only opt for one not both. Regardless I don’t think a meaningful amount will and I think over time that number would continually decrease,msqcyt,2021-04-19 18:34:21
"There really aren’t long term effects from vaccines that don’t show up within the 4-6 weeks after injection. Hundreds of millions of doses have been given and we’ve been able to see nothing unusual after months of tracking. There’s nothing to be worried about.

"There should not be any long term effects.  mRNA is very unstable, after it is used to make spike proteins, it is destroyed.  The spike proteins are cleaned up by your immune system.  People who have problems with the vaccine tend to have them soon after.",mrz47k,2021-04-16 16:01:56
"We know less about the long term effects of Covid than we do about the long term effects of the vaccine. 

I got the Pfizer vaccine, both doses, and my anxiety level had dropped dramatically. 

The vaccine is designed to be safe and has had the world's most brilliant minds testing and testing. Covid is not designed. It is random bits of RNA whose sole purpose is to spread and replicate, killing it's host sometimes. 


I'll stick with the vaccine.",mrz47k,2021-04-16 10:22:53
"Except for the mRNA and the LNPs, if you eat processed food and use mainstream hygiene products, you're being exposed to all the ingredients in the vaccine every day.

Reading about the potential dangers of chemicals anywhere, not just in vaccines (i.e. aluminum, phthalates, MSG, fluoride, non-organic produce), and the unhealthy results they can produce years down the road, instantly triggers the fight or flight response and a desire to Avoid. But there's so much out there, trying to avoid it all drives me crazy. And let's not get into cases like sunlight (It's dangerous! Lack of it is dangerous! Both are true! AAAAAH!).

Imo, protection against a virus known and proven and observed to cause long term effects is worth the risk of additional exposure to ingredients used in the vaccine. We can't avoid all non-100% safe substances 100% of the time, so the vaccine seems a good thing to add to the ""don't bother"" column.",mrz47k,2021-04-16 14:53:31
"As others have noted, there is nothing in the Pfizer vaccine that sticks around. No live or inactivated virus, no vector, nothing. Literally a strand of mRNA surrounded by lipids. Both things that are naturally produced by your body and degrade very quickly. The other (few) ingredients are common and well-characterized. 

There is absolutely no risk of the mRNA changing your genome or interfering with your DNA in any way.

The vaccine induces a natural immune response to the Spike protein.",mrz47k,2021-04-16 16:38:05

"You are right to be concerned.  Much is unknown and the idea that vaccines have no long term consequences is not supported by the best science.  And for a mRNA vaccine?  We are still in a clinical trial that skipped the normal 5-10 years of testing and experimentation.

I’m not a scientist.  But in any other context, the proverbial naive American will defend and justify the FDA’s long and delayed process for approving new vaccines.  They just care so much about safety and all that.

But all they have to do is say “oh, not necessary, pandemic you see”, and poof!  All those essential years of testing are actually just BS, haha, don’t worry your pretty little head.

There are scores of sites, Ivy-league trained scientists and doctors, and analysis out there that question the mainstream Fauci narrative on the dangers of Covid, along with plenty of studies that would cause you to question whether the Covid narrative is all so easily constructed.  Seek it out and come to your own conclusions.

For my part, I’m not a doctor, but when there is no deadly plague for more than 100 years in the World’s most sanitary society and one day it shows up just like Bill Gates and the movies were telling us....yeah I wasn’t born yesterday.  Ventilators were used to increase death counts, and isolation; and useful therapeutics like Ivermectin and Hydroxycloroquine were demonized, ironically due to their longstanding use and safety record.  I’m fit and in my 40’s and eat well.  The virus is not a threat to me—risk of serious injury approaches zero.  I can’t say that for the experimental vaccine. 

As of right now, there are 3000+ deaths and adverse events reported on VAERS.  And no matter what one says, what would you think if your son/mom/wife etc. took the Vax and died of a blood clot or mysteriously within 48 hours?  Was his or her sacrifice “worth it”?  Are we a human sacrifice society now?  Need to kill a few to save the whole?  Is that moral?",mrz47k,2021-04-27 14:57:09

tl;dr: whether or not you've had COVID, there's about a 50-50 chance you'll experience some side effects after the second dose.

>In parallel with antibody response analyses, we also examined post-vaccine symptomology (Supplementary Tables [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01325-6#MOESM1)–[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01325-6#MOESM1) and Extended Data Fig. [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01325-6#Fig5)). **We observed that previously infected individuals experienced significant post-vaccine symptoms (that is, reactogenicity) more frequently than infection-naive individuals after dose 1** (36.8% versus 25.0%, *P* = 0.03). However, there was no between-group difference in significant symptoms after dose 2 (51.3% versus 58.7%, *P* = 0.26). In time-shifted analyses, **infection-naive individuals had higher reactogenicity after dose 2 than previously infected individuals after their first dose** (58.7% versus 36.8%, *P* < 0.001). Fever and chills were more common among previously infected vaccine recipients after the first dose, whereas infection-naive individuals were more likely to experience headache, dizziness or lightheadedness after the second dose. In analyses of changes from dose 1 to dose 2, reactogenicity increased in frequency for infection-naive individuals (25.0% versus 58.7%, *P* < 0.001) and less so in previously infected individuals (36.8% versus 51.3%, *P* = 0.08).",mqw3tu,2021-04-15 18:22:56

"This was a question on the form I filled out before my shot, and I marked that I've fainted from needles before. When they saw, they asked me about it and I was honest: It hasn't happened in a few years, but I've fainted 3 times from needles/medical procedures and come very close a few other times (in addition to needing vaccines for my job, I get blood drawn for thyroid disease, and I donate blood from time to time). 

I'd be honest so they know what to watch out for. You may want to see if you can lay down while getting the shot, although where I went it wasn't an option. Otherwise, make sure to come in with food in your stomach (I usually eat something carb heavy before needles). Sometimes I ask to look at my phone while they do it so I'm somewhat distracted. Lastly, don't stand up too quickly after it's over-- make sure you don't have any dizziness or lightheadedness before standing. 

But it won't be a reason they deny you :)",mr4qtl,2021-04-15 02:50:31

I knocked out my front tooth hitting a door while leaving the doctor's office after a blood test, and ever since then have been very paranoid about needles. I've gotten a lot of vaccines for international travel, plus the flu shot every year, and never fainted from them. I do get anxiety still. 

I had the Pfizer vaccine last week and it was so tiny and painless I thought the guy was joking with me that it was finished. I wasn't faint at all. I drove myself 30 miles to the appointment and back. I got mine at a Walmart pharmacy and spent about an hour in the store after the vaccine just to make sure I was perfectly fine before getting in the car, and I had a snack and coffee in the car before leaving. I also had absolutely no effects from the vaccine, beyond my arm briefly being sore. 

I would recommend having someone else drive you as a precaution. I don't think you'll be denied a vaccine, especially since it was so long ago that you had the reaction, and it was very brief. But it's worth being cautious.",mr4qtl,2021-04-15 08:34:33

"Younger individuals with more robust immune systems have more severe adverse affects from the vaccines.  There is evidence the response is even more dramatic in younger females. There is an upside which is that your immune response if infected later will be much more aggressive in getting rid of the virus than mine or my wife’s response, both in late 60s, neither of us had hardly any systemic response to the vaccine, that could be construed as the vaccine not taking well in us and if later infected we might not fare as well.   We already know that seniors flu vaccine have a lot more antigen in them then those for children and younger adults.

Update: around 6 last night my arm started to get very sore to the point where it hurt to lift it more than a couple inches.

"I booked my shot when appointments were filling up as soon as they opened. The one I was able to snag was Pfizer, but if I'd had a choice, I would have picked Pfizer or Moderna because I cannot resist my human instinct that their higher efficacy is better even though all 3 are so high that the difference doesn't matter!

I feel sorry for J&J because no matter how much they advertise (truthfully) that 66% is still well protected (I believe flu shots aren't even close to that high, and I've never had the flu), when a human looks at 66% vs. 95%, the human instinct will be to pick the 95% every time. I know it doesn't matter, but I'm still glad I was able to get Pfizer and not J&J.

I'm sorry I have no advice as far as allergies go. I had no allergic reaction but no history of vaccine or food allergies. You'll have to look to the widely available lists of ingredients and your doctor for that risk assessment.",mplkj1,2021-04-12 21:11:20

Pfizer - 6 mo RCT data as compared to 3 months for the other two. Israel's widespread Pfizer vaccination seems to be going on OK, although there is some SA variant breakthrough, which was expected, else efficacy on these would be 100%. I don't think we have enough info to make any comparison to J&J. 
J&J - One dose, you can then give zero fucks about COVID at least 3 weeks earlier than Pfizer. 

I don't have a good reason for this decision, but I stuck with my Pfizer appointment on Tuesday even though I could have gotten J&J more conveniently. Probably because most people I know happened to get Pfizer, although some got J&J.",mplkj1,2021-04-12 21:38:00
Of course Pfizer !,mplkj1,2021-04-13 02:57:34

If I had a choice I may have chosen moderna or Pfizer because of the better efficacy rates but honestly I was so happy to be vaccinated I really didn’t care too much which one I got. The one and done aspect was really nice. I’m a sahm but not having to take the chance of feeling icky on two separate occasions while still caring for a toddler was a plus. 

I had no reaction whatsoever, not even a sore arm but I have no history of allergies or side effects.",mplkj1,2021-04-13 01:48:32

My hubby had 1st Pfizer shot and no reaction.

"In the 50s/60s, a drug called thalidomide was given to pregnant woman to ease morning sickness. It caused birth defects. So they stopped giving it. It's not a vaccine preservative. It's not an ingredient in the covid vaccines. As far as I can tell, it isn't even given via injection. But due to logic I can't see, antivaxxers cite it as proof the covid vaccines will harm women's reproductive system. I can only imagine the logic is ""one medicine badly affected pregnancy, so all medicines could badly affect pregnancy or fertility."" Which is ridiculous.

Neither your doctor nor the vaccine manufacturer has anything to gain by harming you. If he clears you, and you have no past bad experience to make you question his judgment, trust it.

I've also read the reports of women's  cycles or flows changing around the time they got the shot. My period ended about a week before I got the 1st Pfizer shot. It did not come early or extra heavy or extra painful afterwards.

Stress and your immune system fighting off an invader can indeed affect your cycle... without causing long term damage. I don't remember how, but estrogen affects our immune system response; that's (theoretically) why women tend to have stronger vaccine reactions than men and a better chance of recovering from the virus itself.

Yes, women respond differently to the vaccine, and we have systems men don't have that are very sensitive to physical and mental stressors. Fortunately, we're also equipped to handle them. I'm not worried. 5 or 6 years ago, I got 2 periods 2 weeks apart - never happened again and test of my hormones showed nothing wrong. Our reproductive system doesn't run like an atomic clock; environmental factors can cause short term changes without causing long term harm. Unlike the virus.",mpl3eb,2021-04-12 20:42:29

With the Moderna vaccine, [1 percentTrusted Source](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) of those ages 18 to 64 reported fever after the first dose, and 17 percent reported getting a fever after the second dose.

"Nope. mRNA has a fairly short half life in mammalian cells, this means it naturally degrades rather quickly. You can only produce the viral protein while the mRNA is undegraded. This makes sense conceptually, if you recognize that all human protein is produced via our own mRNA, and that we're not always producing all of our proteins 100% of the time, because our own mRNA degrades too :).

"Yep, what MrDobbin said in their excellent description 🙂

I wanna start by saying THANK YOU for posting and voicing your concerns. I'm sick of the widespread, ""if you don't wanna get vaccinated you're a dummy"" rhetoric. no! so many folks want answers to reasonable questions such as yours and I applaud you for asking questions 🥰

I'll add a couple minor-ish things:

1) the reason the mRNA doesn't affect our DNA is not because the mRNA is short-lived; rather, DNA resides in the nucleus of the cell and mRNA does not have access to this part of the cell.

2) our cells will only produce tbe spike protein antibodies when needed. that is, when our body's immune system say, ""hey there's some covid garbage in here and we know what to do from here to neutralize the attack."" (yes, I am anthropomorphizing our immune systems 😂)",mowpxu,2021-04-11 21:30:30
"When designing an mRNA vaccine, the dosing etc., can one predict the number of spike protein fragments that will be produced?  I suppose that is hard, and given the different response of different people.  But it should be within some range or order of magnitude limit like will be 10 to 1000 but not 10,000 - that kind of assurity.

I ask because from a quality control perspective, there may be a need to limit the max spike protein fragment load.

Because while people may consider only the infection potential of a vaccine, there is an inflammatory aspect as well.  Too much inflammation and patient needs to be given antiinflammatories to ensure hyperinflammation does not set in (like the 2nd hyperinflammatory (post-day-8) stage of covid19).

Spike protein itself has also potential agglutination potential - as it binds not just to the ACE2 receptor, but is theorized to bind to CD147 on RBCs (red blood cells) - which Dr David Scheim suggested could explain agglutination of blood that has been seen in covid19 from the start.

"Hey, thanks for the praise lol.

Though I will say I'm confused by your 2nd point. Cells won't produce the spike protein after the mRNA is gone. So, they don't produce spike protein ""when needed"" by the immune system, as you say. I think you may be confusing the spike protein production with the upscaled adaptive cellular/antibody response that targets sars-cov-2 infection after vaccination.",mowpxu,2021-04-11 23:40:35
"I appreciate you saying this. I actually posted this question on another sub before coming here and was shocked when it never got approved by the mods. I was worried I would be flagged as some sort of anti vaxxer when I am extremely pro vaccines. I agree that we should openly discuss questions and concerns people have because it helps increase the general public’s knowledge on vaccine safety, as well as lowering vaccine hesitancy.",mowpxu,2021-04-12 01:21:27

"mRNA vaccines can be produced faster than attenuated or inactivated vaccines. For whole virus vaccines, the viruses have to be grown up in large quantities and then packaged into a vaccine formulation. Making mRNA is a lot faster because it doesn't require whole virus particles to be made. mRNA vaccines were being worked on for MERS coronavirus and influenza, so there was already some good safety data, making it easier to switch the platform to a new virus.",moym12,2021-04-11 22:15:55

"I'm no doctor and have done no reasearch obviously but from what I've observed among my own family and friends, those who had COVID at any point over the last year had very strong symptoms in response to their first dose and then less strong but still adverse reactions to their second dose. Conversely, those who have never tested positive for COVID had mild/no symptoms with the first dose and were whammied with the second dose. 

So I think there might be a link between symptoms and having had COVID already but again, just my experience.",moeafj,2021-04-13 13:31:45
"Can somewhat confirm. Just got the Johnson yesterday, after having COVID about two months ago now, and I can safely say that last night was a very miserable experience for me.

"I wish I had insight for you. I know no one who has had such a reaction. I hope she gets better.

I wonder if this is any indication of what the virus itself would have done to her.

I just had a flashback while typing this: An episode of *Mystery Diagnosis* had a woman with undiagnosed porphyria who had a huge flare up of symptoms due to getting a tetanus shot. I shouldn't post that memory, should I...?

"In 2009 there was an increased instance of paresthesia seen in the elderly following the H1N1 flu vaccine.  The symptoms you are describing sound like a mix of paresthesia and hyperesthesia.  Hyperesthesia is when neurons are hyperexcitable , such that even a light touch is painful.  I recommend finding a neurologist at a medical school teaching institution and have her seen.  Other considerations are the use of  TENS, biofeedback and acupuncture.  The neurologist may know of medications which may not cure it but mitigate the pain response.  This reaction has nothing to do with the normal pain response neuroreceptors that’s why the opiates are useless.  I have seen this condition, fortunately transitory in some of my pediatric patients.  From the stand point of a GP, Family Practice, and general Pediatricians there is very little we are able to do.  It is rare and poorly understood.  Definitely report this to VAERS, if she saw any physician they should have already done this!",modayl,2021-04-16 17:13:48

"My wife and I (both aged 70) each have had two doses and are just reaching the 2-week mark after the second, signifying full vax.  My wife felt the side effects a bit more than I, which I read is a common thing with all vaccinations, that the woman reacts a little more strongly. First 24 hours was fine after the first, then we had a couple days of feeling ""off.""  But not enough to be memorable. Our arms were a bit sore.  The second was a little more memorable.  My arm made turning over in bed uncomfortable for several days, and I had a headache and felt overall like I'd had too many margaritas the night before (I hadn't.)  After an afternoon nap about 36 hours post shot I was pretty much back to normal.  My wife felt quite mopey, and hot (not feverish exactly.) She stayed in bed that second day, which is unlike her.  Within three days we were back to normal, and were able to go about our normal duties.  I would say the overall experience was easier (and much much shorter) than getting a cold or flu.  Certainly there was no residual effect (except relief.)

Many of our friends have had the second shots of either Moderna or Pfizer and the worst any of them reported was a night of chills and a low fever on the second day.  Like us, they also said any untoward effects vanished quickly thereafter.  My daughter had Covid a year ago, and more recently had the two shot regimen and felt few ill-effects from them.  

I asked one of the volunteers at our vaxx clinic who watched over recipients if she had seen any serious responses (like anaphylactic reactions) and she said no.  People suffering anxiety attacks were the only negative she had observed.  That suggests anxiety about the shots is much worse than the shots themselves (in the vast majority of cases.)

Second shot, sore arm (I also have covid arm which seems really rare) and then 10 hours post shot I started running a fever. Never got over 102, manageable with Tylenol, a little achy, a bit of a headache, kind of napped off and on the day following the shot.

This time it was there right away but I'm now five days post second dose and it's mostly back to normal.

> In parallel with antibody response analyses, we also examined post-vaccine symptomology (Supplementary Tables [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01325-6#MOESM1)–[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01325-6#MOESM1) and Extended Data Fig. [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01325-6#Fig5)). **We observed that previously infected individuals experienced significant post-vaccine symptoms (that is, reactogenicity) more frequently than infection-naive individuals after dose 1** (36.8% versus 25.0%, *P* = 0.03). However, there was no between-group difference in significant symptoms after dose 2 (51.3% versus 58.7%, *P* = 0.26). In time-shifted analyses, **infection-naive individuals had higher reactogenicity after dose 2 than previously infected individuals after their first dose** (58.7% versus 36.8%, *P* < 0.001). Fever and chills were more common among previously infected vaccine recipients after the first dose, whereas infection-naive individuals were more likely to experience headache, dizziness or lightheadedness after the second dose. In analyses of changes from dose 1 to dose 2, reactogenicity increased in frequency for infection-naive individuals (25.0% versus 58.7%, *P* < 0.001) and less so in previously infected individuals (36.8% versus 51.3%, *P* = 0.08).",mnslnj,2021-04-12 16:07:25
"true. if you've been diagnosed with covid, it can take a bit for antibodies to show up. in particular, if you've had an asymptomatic case of covid, it could take even longer to detect antibodies. it's possible to never detect antibodies depending on your body's response to asymptomatic covid and the detection limit of the antibody test.

my understanding is the antibody detection window is quite different from the covid detection window. the latter is much narrower. iirc, we have folks who are suspected to have covid wait something like 5 days til having them get the PCR test (imo much more reliable than the rapid test, but I digress).

but ya, just wanted to distinguish between the antibody testing time frame and that for testing for the virus. hopefully that wasn't too confusing of a word vomit 😬",mnslnj,2021-04-11 02:28:01

Advise him to ask his doctor about that, and drop off chicken soup, iced tea, and acetaminophen whenever his supply runs low, but avoid contact - it's what he wants, and stressing him by exposing yourself when he doesn't want that wouldn't be good.",mnx5ie,2021-04-10 06:59:39

I’ve been terrified for him ever since the start of the pandemic but by the grace of science he was saved. Moderately ill, recovered at home in 2 weeks. Fine now.

"I'm sorry he's going through this.

We've never had Nyquil in this house (not a moral objection or anything, I just know I've never seen a bottle here), so, no. I only remember everyone taking Tylenol, drinking iced tea, and going through a ton of tissues. My boyfriend and I regularly take ginger capsules and vitamin D, which boost the immune system.

Don't worry, we're fine. I had mild cold symptoms (nowhere near the worst I've ever had in my life) with no fever or loss of senses. My boyfriend was between me and his sister: mild cold symptoms, fever for a day or 2, loss of taste and smell for 10 days. His 88 year old mother with lung cancer was asymptomatic but tested positive. (I only typed all that to let you know we're fine. We're also all Type O.)

That's the perfect Sick Supplies delivery! You guys will get through this fine. He obviously has great support.

I panicked when my test came back positive, made all the ""I love you"" calls to my family, and they and my coworkers were wonderful even though I couldn't be around them.",mnx5ie,2021-04-10 14:48:09
"I think the best answer right now is ""probably but no one is sure"". To really know if the vaccines work against the new variants, we have to see if vaccinated people start getting sick from the variants. While researchers can test this out in the lab, they still don't know for sure until there's real-world/clinical trial evidence. Currently, it's thought that the 3 US vaccines are effective against the UK variant, but data is still coming out on the others. Researchers are looking at early data and giving their best guess, which is why info is conflicting... it's kind of like watching a sports game 3/4 of the way in and saying who you think the winner will be. You're looking at the data that's available and using that to make a prediction, but in 10 minutes you may have new data that will affect your guess.",mnv5li,2021-04-10 05:23:10

Atleast 100+ million people till date would have taken mRNA vaccine. No serious damage documented,mmlsjl,2021-04-08 09:07:25
"That’s exactly what your immune system will do, but you have a trillion cells.  Your cells expressing a foreign protein are *exactly* what happens in a viral infection and so if having some cells express a foreign protein means that your immune system would go after that cell *type,* then the first virus you ever had would have killed you.  

An mRNA vaccine is fundamentally no different from a live attenuated vaccine.  It just takes out some extra steps.

When you get vaccinated against measles, you are being given a measles virus that is really bad at evading the human immune system.  It enters some cells and infects them and then makes viral mRNA, which leads to viral proteins.  Your immune system attacks the infected cells and generates an immune response to measles.

With an mRNA vaccine, we’re cutting out the attenuated virus part and just giving the cells the mRNA we want.  So it’s really no different on a fundamental level.",mmlsjl,2021-04-08 14:14:24
"Autoimmune diseases aren't caused by vaccines. Have you had serious problems with your immune system attacking harmless cells before (meaning, besides non-life threatening allergies)?

Active viruses (I won't say live because they're not alive) are zombies that turn your cells into more zombies driven to make more zombies. The mRNA coding in the vaccines is no more capable of doing what the virus itself does than a sample of your blood is capable of turning into a copy of you. It training your immune system to recognize the virus is no different than what your immune system would do if you caught the virus naturally (except without or with less ability to cause damage).

We now have a choice: we can expose our cells to the mRNA alone, or to the virus itself with its mRNA and all its destructive power (which can harm us and others we encounter).

I don't know how autoimmune diseases affect the sufferer's ability to fight infection, but if they do, I would think a fake training infection using an mRNA dummy would be better than a genuine infection.",mmlsjl,2021-04-08 14:45:38
"The process you are concerned about is called vaccine trafficking.  The vast majority of the vaccine injected into your arm goes to your local lymph system where it was intended and does its innate and adaptive immune things and you are now vaccinated.  A very small portion of the LNP/mRNA makes it into systemic circulation and to other cells.  There are animal studies that show IM injected LNPs over time showing some small level of uptake into the vast majority of cells in the animal(liver, spleen, kidney, etc). This was a different composition of lipids than those in the current vaccines.   Good luck on trying to find trafficking data on Pfizer or Moderna.  I have spent hours going through basic science journals, medical journals, immunology journals etc and cannot find any data specific to these two vaccines.  My concern is not so much with the initial 2 dose series of either vaccine but the response which might occur if a booster is needed say 9-12 months from now.  If the adaptive memory T and B (especially CD8 T cells) fire up in response to a wayward LNP from a booster shot causes a liver or brain cell to start exhibiting spike protein on their surface, this could prove problematic. Unless Pfizer and Moderna release their tissue trafficking data. I don’t see a booster of mRNA vaccine in my future.  (I got the initial 2 dose Pfizer). This is a hot topic in molecular and cellular biology groups online.   There are somewhere in the range of 130+ COVID vaccines either in use or at some stage of preclinical and clinical trials all with their own pros and cons.",mmlsjl,2021-04-17 03:58:47

Your mum might be interested to know that not only is Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin non-toxic, it's even been shown to have [anti-cancer effects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26535909/). So there is nothing to fear about this particular chain of sugars.",mmfk70,2021-04-08 02:22:31

Your immune system then responds, and essentially trains itself to attack the real virus, by attacking the harmless stimulus instead. Of course, when your immune system thinks you're being infected, it sometimes does what it does when you're really infected--so you  might get a fever, chills and so on.

"mRNA vaccines work by instructing your cells to manufacture spike proteins found on the surface of the virus. Your immune system is excellent at recognising anything that doesn't normally belong in your body, and attacking it -- so it will attack these alien proteins as if they were an infection. It doesn't wait around to see if something is a fully-formed virus or bacterium before trying to get rid of it.",mmfk70,2021-04-08 06:38:41

"When your immune system thinks you're infected, it uses a variety of different tools to try to attack the infection, all at once. Some of these tools are not very useful, although they might have been a long time ago (in evolutionary history). For example, fevers are your body's way of trying to kill off infections by overheating them -- although this is not very useful against most pathogens today, it presumably was at some point in history.

This is not a question of any specific effect of using an mRNA vaccine versus another kind of vaccine. It's just your immune system trying to cope with an invader which it doesn't yet understand.",mmfk70,2021-04-08 06:47:32

"I just got my first Pfizer vaccine this afternoon. The pain was so minimal I actually doubted that I'd been given the shot.  I've gotten vaccines before that actually do hurt but this one didn't at all. 

I do understand the concern. I broke my front tooth after having a vasovagal syncope reaction to a blood test and hitting the door on my way out of the office. But the vaccine wasn't comparable to those experiences at all.

Explain to the person giving you the vaccine your history. You'll likely be seated for the vaccine itself and then seated again afterwards. If you need to lie down, just explain that and bring with you something to put on the ground. If you are getting the shot in your car, lie down in the backseat. Obviously try to have someone else drive you.",mlstn6,2021-04-08 01:56:37
"Hi! I(23F) also have had an overactive vasovagal response ever since I was a kid. It usually occurs after sudden pain. I got my J&J vaccine today and the minor pain from the shot caused me to have a little syncope episode. I wasn't nervous going in or receiving it. This was my first time passing out due to a shot so I didn't think to tell anyone before hand. Oops! I sat in the observation area immediately after the vaccine and felt fuzzy. So tell the nurse or pharmacist you are prone to fainting and they will keep a close eye on you and will provide a place for you to sit/lie down with snacks and water. Though yours will be in a parking lot, they will still have chairs and possibly a cot as fainting after vaccines isn't unusual. The whole ordeal for me lasted about 25 minutes starting with receiving the vaccine, immediately feeling an episode, and ended with me feeling mostly fine. I stayed for another 10 minutes after that but was alright. The staff checked in frequently and when I felt ready to leave they asked me if I was sure I was good, I confirmed it, and left. My boyfriend was with me so I didn't have to drive right after though I think I could have.

"Most important thing to remember: Whichever vaccine is most easily available to you and that you can get first is the right one. No question.

But assuming a person can easily get both:

I can tell you I know 3 people, plus myself, who have gotten 1-2 shots of Pfizer and 1 (my 98 year old Pap) who's gotten 1 shot of Moderna. Pap had no side effects but a sore arm. Same with my boyfriend and I (but I haven't gotten my 2nd). My sis and his sis had a day or so of flu like symptoms after 2nd Pfizer. No severe reactions or regrets among any of us.

Sorry, I don't know anyone who's gotten J&J... but I feel sorry for J&J because no matter how much they advertise (truthfully) that 66% is still well protected (I believe flu shots aren't even close to that high, and I've never had the flu), when a human looks at 66% vs. 95%, the human instinct will be to pick the 95% every time. I admit even I'm glad I was able to get Pfizer and not J&J even though medically it doesn't matter!

The fact that the mRNA versions have a reputation for causing worse side effects might even subconsciously work in their favor in the minds of consumers. ""You can handle it, germs can't!""

If you look up the ingredients in the mRNA vaccines, there's nothing new in them except the virus mRNA (which an unvaccinated person would still get in their body if exposed to the virus, just without all its power stripped away).

You feel paralyzed in the face of a choice because so much of your freedom, agency, and choices have been stripped away over the past 13 months. Take it slow.

"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This is a saying for a reason. You’ll definitely get two shots (or one with Johnson and Johnson), but this could be preventing a lifetime of long term side effects. Even with mild cases, people are experiencing “long hauler” symptoms. Blood clots, lung damage, cardiac damage, migraines, etc. These could require treatment that might involve needles. A hospitalization definitely will require needles. Many more than two.

Additionally, you reduce your risk of passing it along to others. Not just your parents, but anyone you interact with. The more people who get the vaccine more quickly, the better, and the more quickly we return to normal.

Finally, the symptoms people are experiencing are better termed “reactogenicity.” Our immune systems haven’t been exposed to this virus yet, and it’s going to react. For example, the proteins in our immune system actually function more efficiently at a slightly higher temp, so a low grade fever is the body’s way of helping it to respond more quickly and also put a pathogen at a disadvantage. I’m guessing (I don’t know for sure) that the novelty of the spike protein is the reason for the more intense reactogenicity of this vaccine versus other vaccines. 

Please reach out if you have any questions! Of course you want to feel confident getting the vaccine, and I’d love to help you along in that process.",mkz927,2021-04-06 02:25:41
"This was the easiest shot I ever got (Moderna). All three major options (US) appear to have very thin and short needles. Process was quicker and less painful than the annual flu shot.

Everyone's body reacts differently to every type of immunization. Get it and protect yourself, your parents and other people. 

Also to note: I hate needles. I hid from nurses under chairs as a kid. I can't look at them. I still get my boosters and other shots.",mkz927,2021-04-06 02:21:54
"Not everybody gets side effects. All my boyfriend and I have had so far were sore arms.

Don't look. Listen to music if you have to. They're used to people who hate needles and will be understanding and supportive. They patiently answered every question my boyfriend had about each shot.

Just get it over with, and it'll be in the past, like getting dental work done is for me - it's miserable, it's unpleasant, it's not fun, but it has to be done for your health.

If you turned out to be someone for whom COVID 19 causes severe effects, you could end up getting TONS of needles and tubes sticking out of you in the hospital. One needle stick you can walk away from after 15 minutes is a lot simpler.

Treat yourself to something nice afterwards as a reward for your courage.",mkz927,2021-04-06 02:28:01
"For side effects: Hydrate. Drink lots of water. I've no idea if that was what did it for me, but after both shots, I felt soreness at the injection site for about 24 hours, which is a very typical vaccine reaction for me, and fatigue for 24-48 hours.",mkz927,2021-04-06 02:21:33
"Hey there,

There are many who have the fear of needles; you aren’t alone. Here is a really good article on coping strategies for fear of needles when getting vaccinated: https://www.okhealthyfamily.org/post/fear-of-needles-three-coping-strategies-you-can-use-at-your-covid-19-vaccination-appointment

As others have mentioned, getting vaccinated will not only protect you but those around you. So proud of you for reaching out with your concerns!!

I wish you all the best! My parents are getting their vaccines next weekend even though my mom hates needles :-). 

Take care!",mkz927,2021-04-06 19:26:27
Do it! You wont feel a thing!!,mkz927,2021-04-06 06:20:36
"I feel the same way.  I am going to wait until September to give myself more time to feel comfortable.  I'll wear my mask and limit socializing to outdoor events only.  There is data to show that the MMR vaccine may offer some degree of protection from severe COVID.  I got a booster last June.  There are also new anti-virals (Molnupiravir) in stage 3 development as well as monoclonal antibody treatments.   There are even studies about mouthwash limiting viral replication.  Maybe send links to your parents to share another perspective?  Your opinion matters too and you shouldn't feel pressured.  

In regard to the needle, pretend your arm is disconnected to your body.  Close your eyes when it is happening and think of something really fun; swimming, dancing, skiing etc.. It takes about 10 seconds and the needle really isn't very long.  Also, maybe go to someone very experienced in giving the vaccine?  Technique is really important and chances are you won't feel a thing.",mkz927,2021-04-06 12:10:04
"Every single vaccine has potential side effects, just not everyone feels them.

I just got my first Pfizer dose.  Shot itself is quick and easy.  Felt it less than a tetanus shot.  I’m currently having fatigue and a low grade fever due to it, but not bad.

And as for the fear of needles - unless you plan to never have kids or ever be hospitalized, might as well start getting used to it now.",mkz927,2021-04-08 00:11:43
I had the shot and no side effects.  Grow up and get the shot.,mkz927,2021-04-06 15:11:05
"You're kidding, right? Fear of needles is stopping you from essentially putting the pandemic behind you? Deal with the needle pain by putting on some numbing gel prior to the shot. As for the side effects, you say you're low risk, so if you do feel anything just sleep it off.",mkz927,2021-04-07 03:34:10
Thank you! I got Pfizer and I definitely thought it hurt but I did survive.,mkz927,2021-04-14 18:02:25
"u/Mkday013 I can confirm. This was the easiest shot I’ve ever had (Pfizer). 

I also hate needles and the anxiety leading up to it was the worse. I psyched myself out from reading all sorts of things and was so nervous that I cried the day before... I wouldn’t recommend doing this. 😞

When it came time for my appointment, the shot was both quick and painless. I didn’t even feel the needle like I usually do with the flu or tetanus shots. It was just a slight pressure and YAY you’re done! 🩹

Side effects are different for everyone. I know people who had no side effects at all to others who had nauseating headaches. But for most people, the side effects from the vaccine tend to go away within 48 hours. To me, this is a very small price compared to getting Covid, which you could have worse symptoms for weeks non-stop or even for the rest of your life... no one really knows what the long term side effects of Covid are. 

Regarding timing, I agree with you that it’s annoying to have your parents pestering you to get the vaccine, but on the bright side, they got it and they’re just thinking about you! I was the one pestering my parents to get it for months. My mom works in a hospital, and she refused to get it up until recently even though it was available to her in since Dec. My dad is high risk due to heart surgery, so you can imagine the frustration. 

Another thing is that some areas are reopening quickly, which means that people are naturally going to be more relaxed on masks, sanitizing, etc. Some places may even revert back to pre-Covid standards. Even if you stay in and continue doing what you’re doing, everyone else is not going to do that. 

I really urge to get the vaccine as soon as it available to you. If not for yourself, for those around you. The only way we’ll all be able to move forward is together!",mkz927,2021-04-11 17:47:28
"Thank you. I got Pfizer this morning and it did hurt more than I was hoping it would, but I made it through.",mkz927,2021-04-14 18:03:26
Will do. Just got the first shot about 3 hours ago and my arm is decently sore. Not awful at this point so hoping this is the worst of it.,mkz927,2021-04-14 18:04:19
"Thank you! Got it this morning, definitely wasn’t fun and hurt more than people led me to believe but I survived. One more then hopefully no more needles for a very long time.",mkz927,2021-04-14 18:05:20
I did get it although I definitely felt it.,mkz927,2021-04-14 18:05:54
"This is what I’d like to do, I thought I’d have more time ie at least mid summer but they have opened it up to everyone in my state. Was not prepared for it this soon. 

With waiting later I was also hoping to be able to go somewhere like an actual doctors office with privacy and someone who has a lot of experience giving shots. I’m even less comfortable in a public scenario like a mass vaccine site or a pharmacy.",mkz927,2021-04-07 12:49:26
"I know most vaccines come with the possibility of soreness maybe a headache etc but this seems like people get full blown sick from it from what I’ve heard. The fact that I’m not familiar with any other vaccines that cause that severe of side effects is what concerns me about them. 

I could be wrong I’m by no means an expert",mkz927,2021-04-08 00:15:49
"Tip: If your goal is to persuade someone to get the shot, know your audience and word your opinion in a way that will accomplish that goal.",mkz927,2021-04-07 17:43:21
Yes fear isn’t always rational and I’m more afraid of needles than my personal risk of covid. Not saying it’s correct risk assessment but it’s what my mind does.,mkz927,2021-04-07 12:46:24
"Thanks, I got it today. I actually did think it hurt more than people led me on to believe. I definitely felt it. My arm is definitely sore now but hoping this is as worse as it gets. Not looking forward to the second one but I’ll be glad to hopefully not need another needle for a very long time.",mkz927,2021-04-14 18:01:32
"Congratulations!

Disclosure: I got my 2nd Pfizer shot 3 days ago. 21 hours later, the battle began. I WFH and texted my boss for the afternoon off. All I wanted to do was lie down. I had sore knees, a headache, and my fever peaked at 101.8. I drank all the water and iced tea in the house. 7 hours later, I felt better but queer. The next morning, I was fine.

Among the people I know personally who got any of the 3 vaccines, my sister and I are the only ones who have had side effects. What differentiates us is that we're the only women of childbearing age.

It was a brutal few hours, but better than being a long hauler like my friend in NJ.",mkz927,2021-04-14 20:50:41
Hey there! You are such a trooper!!! I’m so proud of you! Thanks for sharing!,mkz927,2021-04-14 18:07:06

"The wait is ALWAYS worse than the dreaded event itself, no matter what that event is.",mkz927,2021-04-07 17:41:55
"IMO the longer you wait, the longer you just prolong your anxiety about something you ultimately will do anyway.  Tell the person you don’t want to see the needle.  5-10 seconds and it’s done versus months of needless anxiety over it.  This also is totally fine to be done at a pharmacy or max vacination site rather than a doctors office.  It’s not a difficult shot to administer it literally just goes directly into your shoulder like a tetanus shot.",mkz927,2021-04-08 00:19:16
"ALL vaccines have the possibility of making you sick in some way.  People get full blown sick from the flu shot all the time, but they are the minority.  Many more people have lesser symptoms.  Same with this.  

Lots of people experiencing symptoms and discomfort but very few experiencing as bad as it would be if they actually got COVID.  You also are going to hear about it a lot more because this is the first time in most people’s lifetimes that the entire world is getting vaccinated at once.  But just because everyone is talking about it doesn’t mean it’s actually more severe than any other vaccine in reality.  Most of us too are vaccinated for all the bigger things when we are babies, so we really don’t have a ton to compare it to that we would actually remember.

My husband got the vaccine and had no side effects at all.

And also keep in mind that side effects like fever headache etc are actually a GOOD sign.  It means your body is recognizing and learning to fight something new in your system.

Bottom line is try not to let anxiety about it consume you.  That’s going to be far worse than the shot itself.",mkz927,2021-04-08 00:22:40

Thanks. Not looking forward to the next one but will be very glad to have this behind me!,mkz927,2021-04-15 03:28:46
Yay!  Glad you got it.  I'm assuming you've had a tetanus shot before?  For me it felt about the same and they are injected in the same place.  The reason they are more painful is because it is injected into your muscle.,mkz927,2021-04-14 18:09:54
"I have but it’s been a long time so I don’t really remember it. It has been probably close to 12 or 13 years since I’d had any vaccines or shots so that definitely contributed to my anxiety as well. 

Side note isn’t that where all vaccines are given? I have no idea honestly but the only ones I remember getting were given in the same area of my arm.",mkz927,2021-04-14 18:12:59
"Some are given subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly.  And hate to break it to you, but you are overdue for your tetanus too, lol.  Again, better to get it than get tetanus and have to have 50 million shots and IVs etc.",mkz927,2021-04-14 18:15:42
Yeah I figure I’ll have to do it at some point actually feel like there could be others I need as well since it’s been so long but will deal with that at another time. Wish you could get COVID with others and I could just knock it all out.,mkz927,2021-04-14 18:19:11
"Hard to tell how they would handle it without actually talking to a representative, so if I were you I’d talk directly to Kaiser Permanente.

"When I was searching for a vaccine lots of places asked if it was trying to schedule my 1st or 2nd shot.

This was in VA though and I know we botched the initial rollout in a way where people had to fend for themselves to get the 2nd and they've fixed it since then. Not sure if anywhere still does it that way (only getting 2nd) but it's worth looking around with different pharmacies and the state run places to see.",mktnwq,2021-04-05 23:08:16

Ah thank you for circling back. Yep! I read the same! My nausea lasted majority of the day on day 2 but went away right around the full 48 hour mark from the time I got the vaccine. All in all it took 2.5 days to recover but feeling good now!,mkxncd,2021-04-08 00:08:01

"The official word is that 1 shot of the 2 dose versions is 80% effective. Don't know how long it lasts. Imo, not a good idea for politicians to ignore the scientists' instructions. Better than nothing, definitely, but I'm just not comfortable with the idea of cutting corners to save time; in all other areas, that strategy just makes things worse.",mkyr7z,2021-04-06 02:35:37
"I heard an immunology guy talking about it today on NPR. He said the efficacy is 80% but they don't know how long it will last. They also were unsure about the severe covid.

He highly recommended the second dose as the efficacy goes to 95% and severe covid is greatly minimized.

My second dose is Thursday, hopefully minor side effects. Most people have said headache and such for less than a day.",mkyr7z,2021-04-06 17:18:54
"As the others have suggested, it depends which vaccine you get. Up to now, most people in the UK have been receiving the AstraZeneca jab, which has not been approved in the US (and doesn't seem likely to be any time soon). If you get that, you will just have to get a full two doses of one of the mRNA vaccines (or one dose of Johnson & Johnson) when you arrive in the US. So far, there is no evidence to suggest that it is harmful to mix vaccines in this way, but it's too early to say for sure. Chances are you'd be fine, though you might want to leave at least a few weeks between the doses.

On the other hand, the UK is currently shfiting to using the bulk of its AstraZeneca to give 2nd doses to all the people who have already had 1st doses. That, combined with a bit of a supply hiccup this month, means that it seems likely they will switch to other vaccines for more people. A shipment of Moderna is about to arrive, and they've ordered 17 million doses which are supposed to be part of getting everyone vaccinated by the end of July (along with Novavax and Johnson & Johnson). So, it is not impossible you might get a Moderna jab instead.

If that happens, it should be very easy to schedule yourself a second Moderna jab in the US, because appointment bookings in the US are totally decentralised and seem in most states to be happening in a fairly anarchic way that allows you to shop around.",mk4pd2,2021-04-05 06:36:27

While it is true that people report a more severe immune response to the 2nd shot, that's more severe symptoms caused by the antibody fight mounted against the mRNA. Have there been reports of people going from very mild, very brief allergic reaction on shot 1 to life threatening anaphylaxis on shot 2?

If not, and if it were me, and I speak this with 100% truth, I would take some Allegra beforehand and go get the 2nd shot, being 100% truthful with the pharmacist about the first allergic reaction. If their policy says it's too dangerous to give the 2nd in such a case, that would be a hard No.

Major kudos to you for having a reasonable reaction to this experience and taking a calm, responsible approach.

I did not take anything. I probably should have. Right now I'm just kind of stuck and torn on what to do. I want my second dose. I'm trying to figure out if I should see an allergist to see if it was maybe another thing that caused it or what not or if the vaccine itself caused it. Or should I just hold off and wait for more data and maybe new vaccines down the road. Possibly the johnson and johnson one. I'm quite lost honestly.,miwqcb,2021-04-03 22:24:57
"Actually, I just thought of this, was it actually hives or another kind of rash? There is a unique kind of rash being reported by some people as ""COVID"" arm that does not prevent them from getting a second dose.

They official CDC guidance on the topic is here:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html

They discern the difference between an allergic reaction and a rash.

I guess it showed up within 2 hours and counts as an ""immediate"" reaction though. I can understand your disappointment. They probably want to collect more information on this before telling anyone it is safe. Its possible guidance will change in the future.",miwqcb,2021-04-03 22:37:15
How do you feel now? And did you wind up taking the second dose or not?,miwqcb,2021-05-17 02:58:23
That is true for sure. I read stuff on the 80% effectiveness. I also read I may be able to get the johnson and johnson after I wait a month as a replacement for the 2nd shot.,miwqcb,2021-04-03 01:38:28
"I did do the V safe survey and have heard nothing so far. I'm assuming they just say don't get it because it's not technically approved and that reaction to the vaccine hasn't been studied that throughly.

I'm not too worried about the immune response from the vaccine. I can deal with the temporary aches and pains. I'm concerned about an allergic reaction if I did receive the 2nd dose since the first caused a mild reaction. I want to get the 2nd dose. I've never had any allergic reactions to anything before as far as I know. 

I've read a lot on reactions and I haven't found much data on mild reactions to it. I saw an article where one woman was denied the 2nd after hives from the first. And with the polyethylene glycol which is what they believe is what causes the reactions, I have looked at many of the the things in my home and ingredients list polyethylene glycol. However I have not had any noticeable reactions to said items previously. 

I'm kind of torn on what to do. They want to to consult an allergist first if I chose to go through. But I'm concerned about how much it would cost me. I ended up choosing a high deductible insurance plan because I rarely ever visit a doctor, so I figured it wasn't worth the cost of higher premiums. 

In the end I really want to get my second shot but am concerned with any adverse reactions to it. And if the cost of consulting an allergist is really worth it. Originally the doctor said I am good to go for the second one like it should have been ok. Then later I got a call from the doctor saying she talked to someone at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN saying I should not go through with it without consulting an allergist first.

It could have been a reaction to something totally different but who knows. I didn't do anything or touch anything else out of the ordinary.",miwqcb,2021-04-03 14:27:14
"It was not ""covid arm"" as they call it. About 2 hours after I developed on the underside of my forearm on my vaccinated arm a red spot maybe about the size of a quarter. Then a bump showed up, white colored maybe a little smaller than a pea in the middle. I don't remember what came next but I also got a few rashes on my back by my shoulder, my other arm on the underside, the side of my stomach, and then one more on the top of my forearm on my vaccinated arm. I can't recall 100% but I don't think any of the other had bumps in the middle. I should have took pictures but my anxiety was getting to me to the point I was having a panic attack. I felt my throat feel tighter roughly 15 seconds 2 times and took a sip of water both times and it went away. I belive the throat tightness was due to the panic attack and not reaction I was happening. All in all the spots went away in about 45 minutes by themselves.",miwqcb,2021-04-03 22:45:55

I was reading up on this pseudoallergy thing. So it could potentially be dose dependant? If it is that would mean that I would be ok to take the 2nd dose because it would be the same dose and the same reaction. How would I know what the actual cause of it was.,miwqcb,2021-04-03 22:51:28

So you saying there is a possibility that I may never be able to take it safely? However I have looked at a lot of items around my house and a lot of listed PEG as an ingredient. I have not had a reaction to those. That leads me to believe it is either something else in the vaccine or any of the equipment or PPE used or something totally unrelated caused it.,miwqcb,2021-04-03 22:14:02
"It could also be a coincidental thing, like the people who get a flu vaccine right at the start of seasonal cold and flu season, get a flu like virus (not necessarily influenza but possibly one of many viruses that cause similar symptoms), and forever conclude the flu vaccine gives you the flu.

Did you take an antihistamine to treat it? That would be a way to tell if it's a pseudoallergy of not- diphenhydramine would help a true allergy but not a pseudoallergy. On the rare occasion I get hives (have not figured out what causes it) diphenhydramine will put a stop to it pretty quickly.

I think the PEG is the only substance that has been flagged in the vaccine itself that people are having reactions to. The vaccine otherwise is composed of lipids and mRNA and a few other things essential to sustaining life you can't be allergic to.",miwqcb,2021-04-03 22:20:33
"The short answer is that we don’t have enough information from either vaccine as to the precise mechanism of how this may be occurring. The best information we have on the likely presupposing events is a paper published on the 30th of March which I will link [here](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/a-1469-7481.pdf). Basically, the authors are claiming that the vaccine induced anti-platelet antibodies which can activate the clotting cascade and result in this sort of thrombosis. That being said, multiple reviews have found no significant link between the vaccine and the thrombotic events.

To add a little clarity in terms of risk factors, it’s currently sitting at 1 in 600,000. The contraceptive pill for females has a thrombosis risk of 1 in 10,000 which as you can see is significantly higher than the AZ vaccine. 

Ultimately we wouldn’t be able to know if the J&J vaccine induced the same sort of issue unless it was specifically investigated. That wouldn’t be the case unless there are reports of thrombosis following administration of the vaccine. The fact that it’s an adenovirus vector doesn’t mean that it will behave the same way and produce the same responses as the AZ vaccine so we shall simply have to wait and see.",mispcj,2021-04-03 00:07:13
"There really hasn't been enough of the J&J vaccine administered yet to know, it took many tens of millions of doses of the AZ vaccine to even notice there is a trend because it's still rare.

I do know that J&J is using a different, stabilized, spike. While it's using an adenovirus vector it's a human adenovirus vector that spreads naturally in human populations. The AZ vector is a Chimpanzee adenovirus and if the immune system has a rare adverse reaction to it, we would have to deliberately expose humans to it on a large scale as we have now to even notice it",mispcj,2021-04-03 22:14:38
"There is a prognosticated risk with all of them, especially if you've previously had covid. 

But there is a different reason to avoid this vaccine. 


To understand why Johnson & Johnson's clinical trial actually was the least impressive against protection against all CV-19 infection, on needs to understand about their primary endpoint. 

Only Johnson & Johnson set its primary efficacy objective as the prevention of moderate or severe COVID-19. (Not mild or asymptomatic.) So if you really want to protect against infection of any severity only Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have a primary efficacy objective of preventing any COVID-19, no matter the severity.

"I've had both doses of the Moderna vaccine. I got it because it was the one my workplace had--I would have been perfectly content with Pfizer also (J&J was not available when I was vaccinated, but also would have been fine to get it.) I was happy with any of them because all have been shown to be very safe and quite effective at preventing infection with COVID. I continue to be happy with my choice as more data emerges on the vaccines' impact on transmission, as well--this isn't surprising, but makes me happy anyway.   


I recommend that anyone who is not contra-indicated for a vaccine get vaccinated as soon as a vaccine is available to them. Specific contra-indications should be discussed with a doctor and/or the vaccine clinic.   


Side effects are fairly common--I had a very sore arm with both for a couple days, aches and a fever for a day after the second. This is in line with data from these vaccines and others, and pretty typical for how I personally react to vaccines.   


Some resources on side effects, with extra links to relevant info: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html)",mhe02x,2021-03-31 21:05:29

I've had both doses of Pfizer. Sore arms both times, second dose gave me a low grade fever the second day that broke quickly and I felt fine. Always felt fine immediately after the shot, as did my partner and the friend with no side effects.",mhe02x,2021-03-31 23:15:19

With the second shot my arm was sore enough to make turning over in bed uncomfortable for several nights.  Meanwhile my wife felt lousy enough to spend the 2nd day in and out of bed, kind of mopey.  In contrast I just felt tired and dull.  That was the extent of it... nothing like catching a bad flu or cold.  And it passed quickly with no residual effects except great happiness and relief.",mhe02x,2021-04-04 20:23:50
"Just got my first dose today! When I signed up at this particular clinic, they weren't able to tell me which one I was getting right away. However, it turned out to be Moderna. I guess I was hoping for Moderna or Pfizer because those two are proven to be the most effective.

As for side effects, I pretty much immediately developed a mild headache after leaving the clinic with some pressure by my temples. Went home and drank a lot of gatorade which helped. I'm also dealing with a pretty sore arm and fatigue. But other than that, good. 

If I remember, I'll update again when I get my second dose!",mhe02x,2021-04-09 23:59:59

"I got my first job of pfizer yesterday, I did not have a sore arm but today I've been very tired and I felt like I had to hang over this morning that I took Tylenol to get rid of the neck and face headache. they say that infection started to curb down during the trials after day 10 after your first shot so I'm guessing that's about when antibody production should begin for me.",mhe02x,2021-04-01 01:31:55
"Good for you! Vaccines are very safe--I tend to get mild side effects (low-grade fever for a day, sometimes soreness at the site), but they go away within a day. If there are specific concerns you have, the [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center) has some awesome pages on just about every rumor, written for laypeople, with sources. CDC also has a lot of resources.   


The vaccines you need will depend a little on where you live (I assume American since you mentioned insurance) and what illnesses you've had, but this is a good place to start: [https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4030.pdf](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4030.pdf)  


It may be good to start with a doctor and check with your health insurance, but they should be covered, according to this: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/pay-for-vaccines.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/pay-for-vaccines.html).   


If not, check with your local health department.",mhe4om,2021-04-01 16:20:38
"Congrats on registering for the Pfizer! The COVID vaccines are free, and you won't need insurance for that one.

Unfortunately other vaccines are not free, and you would need to pay to see a doctor and pay for the vaccines given to you. Health insurance would cover a lot of them, but if you can't afford insurance, you may want to look around for affordable clinics that can help get you on the right track.

I will say that you'll (probably) find doctors to be pretty understanding of your situation and happy to help out, rather than shaming you. We can't control what our parents did for us medically as children, and seeking out care now is a good thing!

As for pain and side effects:  I'd rather get a vaccine than stub my toe. Vaccines don't really hurt, but they aren't totally painless. While getting the shot it's a pretty quick poke with a bit of discomfort for about 2-5 seconds. Some will make your arm a little sore the next day. Not all vaccines give side effects, but the COVID vaccines make a lot of people feel a bit run-down for a few hours or a day. I felt like I had a mild cold for the day, but I woke up feeling totally normal and healthy. In this case, it just means your immune response is working! 

You may want to mention you haven't been vaccinated before. It's very rare, but a small number of people have allergic reactions to vaccines. You'll want to hang out at the pharmacy for 10-15 minutes to make sure you don't have reactions. Again, *very rare*, but a good thing to watch out for on your first vaccine.",mhe4om,2021-04-01 02:32:46
"Congratulations! My 3 sibs and I got all our childhood vaccines except chickenpox (that was after our time). They never caused any side effects for us. I get my flu shot every year and have never had  single side effect from that. I got my 1st Pfizer covid shot and had a sore arm for 3 days.

Don't be afraid of side effects. I'm not exaggerating when I say: none of the horror stories you've heard about vaccines are true. The only genuine threat is an allergic reaction to ingredients, which A) are rare, and B) they will screen for with questions before administering. No modern vaccine has side effects worse than the disease imho.

You can get them at a doctor's office or at a pharmacy. With no PCP to ask what they recommend, maybe you could call or email a pharmacy, explain, and ask what they recommend. They could also give you their prices without insurance.

At the right time of year, some places offer free flu shots.

A tetanus shot is a must have. If you're under 26 and sexually active, they recommend a ""catch up"" HPV vaccine.

If you had any stereotypical childhood illnesses like chickenpox or measles, you won't need that vaccine. If you didn't, you should definitely get the chickenpox and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccines, at minimum.",mhe4om,2021-04-02 01:13:56

Thanks for the heads up about allergies too. I'll mention that it will be my first vaccine at my appointment, just incase. I'm nervous, but excited to take the step to keep everyone safer!",mhe4om,2021-04-01 20:37:15

"1) your body attacks the spike protein, which is attached to the entire complex that is the covid virus, hence neutralizing the virus

2) spike proteins differ even within the coronaviruses (the mutations you've been hearing about... UK, south africa, etc). the antibodies your body produces to attack the mutants have varying efficacy, depending on which mutation we're talking about. this is the subject of ongoing research.

my understanding is that it comes down to this: how well do the antibodies your body produces post-vaccination do at binding to covid variants. by variants I mean there's been some mutation that changes the structure of the spike.",mhb05z,2021-04-01 02:59:18
"Here's a very in-depth overview looking at the vaccine from a programmer's mindset. https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/
There are also posts about the other covid vaccines on that site.

In a nutshell, after vaccination, the mRNA enters cells at the vaccination site and instructs them to build spike protein.

As a function of the immune system, every cell presents snippets of all the proteins it makes at the cell surface. These are constantly checked by immune cells.

If these cells find proteins that have never been seen before, as a defense they kill the affected cell, and also release messenger substances such as interferons.

These kick multiple defense systems into gear, they also make you feel a bit shitty (every cell in the body reduces their protein output for a while to help slow the presumed infection while the defense is getting ready).

The remains of the killed cell containing freshly constructed spike protein are then carried to lymph nodes, where lymphocytes are trained to find and hone defensive antibodies. As they ramp up production, you can feel your lymph nodes swell as the lymphocytes multiply to find the best antibody producing clones.

The antibodies bind to any spike protein they find if you encounter the virus, blocking it from attaching to a cell. They also work as flags marking it for destruction.

As the foreign protein ceases to be found, the new lymphocytes reduce their numbers and some of them become memory cells.

When you get your booster shot, the body builds on this memory to build more antibodies faster, while also again improving their quality.",mhb05z,2021-04-01 17:29:57
"Linked is an extremely silly comedian’s take, but accurate! The spike protein is critical for attaching to your body’s cells, and without it, the virus can’t enter your cells to replicate. Viruses need a host (or cell) to reproduce in, they cannot reproduce themselves. If they can’t enter, they can’t infect or reproduce.

"Not crazy at all. Cautious is not crazy.

There are some misconceptions though. Researchers have been testing mrna vaccines for other coronaviruses for 10-20 years and following up with the test subjects. SARS and MERS just didn't prove to create a long enough or big enough interest. 

So all the building blocks were there, with a slight tweak of the exact MRNA strand. It's actually really well tested science and frankly a miracle that everything was already in place when we were caught with our pants down on so much other pandemic preparedness.",mhatmi,2021-03-31 18:18:08
"Keep in mind that this type of vaccine is unlike traditional vaccines and the very nature of this vaccine means it can be rapidly developed. 

While this is the first mRNA vaccine approved, the work that has gone into it has been ongoing for years. For example, [here is a study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28222903/) from Moderna published in Cell in 2017 showing in vitro efficacy for an mRNA vaccine for Zika virus. 

The great thing about the RNA vaccine is that all you need to do it swap out the RNA sequence in the vaccine to develop a new version of it. this is unlike traditional vaccines which require purifying subunits, inactivating viruses, etc. and take much more lead time.

In fact, I would argue that mRNA-based vaccines are safer than traditional vaccines just because there is a lot less to them - mRNA inside of a lipid envelope. You're literally just making a protein (something your body is doing all the time) during a very short window.

Plus, entirely new flu vaccines are developed from scratch and approved each year and nobody bats an eye about receiving those.",mhatmi,2021-03-31 18:58:55
"Maybe the best route is to research the vaccines and studies to make an informed decision on which vaccine you prefer.

I think ""rushed"" is the wrong term.  In emergent situations we aren't able to study the effects years after, just the same as we aren't able to lock down for years. The manufacturers have been heavily funded and have been perfecting mRNA vaccines for many years. 

In a pandemic, we should be grateful for a safe vaccine to be made, studied, tested, and approved in record time due to the tremendous advances in medicine since the last time the world needed a vaccine for a pandemic. 

Think of polio. The first polio epidemic in the US was in 1875. Early vaccine trials began for polio in 1935 and the biggest push for vaccine trials began in 1954 - 79 YEARS after the first US epidemic. It took 79 years because our understanding of virology, immunology, and inoculation were very limited. But we aren't limited by those factors today.

Could you imagine the death toll of humans after 79 years of Covid19? Now think about the mutations that would have occurred in Covid19 in 79 years. Do you still think a speedy resolution with a tested technology (mRNA) as risky as not vaccinating?

I'm a huge proponent for being your own advocate. You are not crazy. But your fear is misplaced on the vaccine and should be placed squarely on the virus and the havok it has done to survivors, non-survivors, survivors with lingering symptoms, economies, and families.",mhatmi,2021-03-31 20:18:45

"This. Plus the biggest hurdles in most vaccine studies are two things: getting enough patients to enroll in trials and (importantly) funding.

When the entire world needs a vaccine ASAP, the funding comes in quick. Plus, with so many people infected, the trials were able to give enough information quickly whether it is effective or not.

As far as safety goes: like the comment above me said, this has been tested for many years before this. It just never had a reason to be widely developed because there hasn't been a pandemic like this in 100 years.",mhatmi,2021-03-31 18:55:34

I feel like everyone is brainwashed and drinking from the same kool-aid. True MRNA technology has been around, yet most companies abandoned the usage due to the side effects and other things that went wrong with the process due to its complexity.

"I didn't provide any because the numbers change daily. The CDC website would be the best imo. I participated in V Safe - after I got my shot, I received a text every day with a link to a survey to enter my symptoms for a week. That's where they get their data, from people who do that. I tried to convince my boyfriend to do it (since he's immunocompromised and paralyzed from a spinal cord injury, I figured they would be very eager to know how it affected people like him, doubly so when he had no side effects except a sore arm from either shot), but didn't want to help the govt surveil him blah blah blah...

I did put together a 5 page breakdown of the ingredients in the 3 vaccines for my family, too long to paste here. Except for the lipid nanoparticles and virus mRNA and protein codes, every ingredient is in your food and/or hygiene products or in nedication prescribed for other purposes - *none* of them are new.

Don't kniw where you live, but none of the covid vaccines approved in my country (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson) contain eggs, gelatin, milk product, mercury, thimerosal, thalidomide, or aborted fetal cells. None of that is going into your body here. What is? Salt, sugar, alcohol, citric acid, common food preservatives, and not-new medications (again, I don't have room, but the lists of ingredients are available on multiple websites, and looking up their uses in food and hygiene products illustrates how widely used they already are).",mhatmi,2021-04-03 03:43:45
"Unless you sit in an air tight room on a heavily monitored diet for 2 years, there's no way to determine what if anything you've done over a period years long causes something. Imo, a side effect that occurs 2 years later doesn't count as a side effect because there's no way to know if it was due to which medication you took over the past 2 years, what food you ate, what area of the world you traveled to, what partner you slept with, what toothpaste you used, what fertilizer you used in your garden, or what paint you used in your kitchen in the past 2 years.",mhatmi,2021-04-05 21:54:01
We won't know until a while what the side effects are. It's too short to know. I cringe when they say the benefits outweighs the risk. I have a chronic health issue and went through enough experimental drugs. I learned the hard way. I look up everything before taking anything. Come to find out all of the medical doctors I had was wrong and was giving me drugs that caused other issues that was worst than the original issue. That's no such thing as a quick fix. I had to work hard to regain my mobility and work hard to keep it. I rather do that than taking harmful drugs.

"> We won't know until a while what the side effects are. It's too short to know.

I'm curious why you think this. This isn't a like a regular small molecule drug with a typical PK profile. You're literally making a normal protein for a matter a hours (and mounting an immune response to that protein). Nothing from the vaccine sticks around. I'm curious what kind of long-term side effects you are concerned about. The vaccines have been studied in tens of thousands of people in clinical trials and used by hundreds of millions more at this point. We have a really good idea what the side effect profile looks like at this point.

Also, it's great to eat healthy. But no amount of healthy food is going to make your immune system recognize a foreign antigen or virus that it hasn't been exposed to. That's the point of the vaccine.",mhatmi,2021-04-01 12:57:44

"The pharmacy will have you wait for 15 minutes just in case you have a reaction, but this is super rare and even more rare for someone who hasn't had an allergic reaction to vaccines. You could tell the pharmacist you have some anxiety so that they can walk you through it.

If you've had a cold or the flu before (which I'm sure you have!), you'll definitely be able to handle the side effects. I had some side effects to the pfizer vaccine-- a headache and very mild muscle aches, plus some fatigue. It only lasted a few hours for one evening, and when I woke up the next day I felt 100% normal. Maybe to ease the anxiety of feeling a little under the weather, you could something like treat yourself to some junk food, a movie, and a night lounging on the couch. I picked up a bag of my favorite candy and played a videogame as my post-vaccine relaxation.

A lot of my friends have had the moderna shot and they've all said they felt fine after the first dose and had side effects after the second.

Most my coworkers and friends that have received the Moderna had almost no side effects (only sore injection site). 

From what I've read, the Vaccines mRNAs that prep the body's auto immune response are themselves neutralized by your body's immune system (which is what causes the side effects). Your body removes the mRNAs like it removes most foreign entities (or viruses, bacterial etc) and gets flushed out in your urine. Nothing left in your body means nothing to be worried about long term.

Ultimately I decided that I trust the many doctors (including my own), epidemiologists, and researchers who have shared facts regarding MRNA research (60 years in the making based on what I’ve read) AND I’ve had Covid as a young, healthy person and it left me with a lot of issues that have been terrifying (and expensive!) to deal with. I do not want to experience Covid again, so the vaccine is my best chance at protecting myself and others. I had my first dose of Pfizer yesterday and was very nervous right afterwards, but I was monitored for 15 minutes and ended up being completely fine. My arm was pretty sore throughout the rest of the day and night and still is a little sore today. I thought I’d feel pretty crappy, but I’ve actually been fine. I’ve just been tired today. My boyfriend was also vaccinated at the same time yesterday and he also has just had a sore arm.

"I stayed up late into the night for almost a week trying to snag a spot for my covid vaccine. I finally found an opening one county over. Even though I don't drive, I took it. I couldn't get anyone to drive me, so I had to take a bus. Of course, there's only one southbound and one northbound bus each day, so I spent 5 hours strolling around this small town I'd never been to before, getting snacks and drinks, surfing the web on my phone, and ducking into a gas station to use their restroom until my appt at 4.

They have things spaced out so there's no line. I signed in at the table they had set up near the entrance and followed the directions to the back of the store. One woman was ahead of me.

My turn. It was no different than getting my flu shot, except they gave me a card afterwards stating I got the shot. Had to wait in chairs set up fir this purpose for 15 minutes after. Nothing happened to me or anyone else waiting. I then had 2 and half hours to wait til my bus home came. I got to my house after 9 pm. My boyfriend ate a cold can of ravioli for dinner lol.

My upper arm started to feel sore 6 hours later. It was sore for 3 days. Not my entire arm, just that one muscle. I have an office job which was unimpacted. It didn't affect my ability to carry heavy bags of groceries. No other side effects.

Get my 2nd shot next week, which is most commonly the one that causes side effects. Trying to get my sister to drive me this time lol.

My boyfriend has a spinal cord injury; some of the effects of that are he uses a wheelchair and is immunoconpromised. He was eligible before me, and, fortunately, I was able to grab him an appt at our local pharmacy around the corner (different provider). The process was almost identical except they scanned his ID and insurance card, and gave him the same paper to sign as when I get my flu shot there every year.

He's had both shots (we both got Pfizer). He didn't have any side effects except a sore arm both times. Said it was more sore the 2nd time.

The most important thing for you to keep in mind is that it's okay to be afraid. Don't feel guilty or ashamed for feeling apprehensive. It's actually more impressive that you're getting it despite your fear than it is for someone who has no fear to conquer.

Look at it as an adventure, like I did because of the trip involved. You already know it's going to help save the world, that it's an important mission. I'm sure missions to save the world are never easy.

You can do this. It'll be fine.",mg3tyu,2021-04-02 01:58:50

"The side effects is not a direct action of the vaccine, but rather your immune system revving up. The same thing happens when you get sick with cold. It's not even that severe. Out of most people who got it in our hospital department, only few had fever. I did have fever, but I still worked my shift, just kept taking tylenol. Then I went home, took a long nap and everything was back to normal next day.",mg2tk4,2021-03-30 01:41:59
"Just because this is the first effective mRNA vaccine doesn't mean the tech hasn't been studied for a long time. There have been mRNA trials for 10+ years, it just hasn't yielded an effective vaccine before now. But in 10+ years it also hasn't shown any long term issues.",mg2tk4,2021-03-30 10:42:05
"I felt a bit tired for a day and the injection site was sore for two.  So basically the same as staying up too late and bumping into a door.  Totally worth it.  Get the second dose.

Another reason to get it is that a vaccine passport is looking increasingly likely in the near future.",mg2tk4,2021-03-30 02:14:47
"The reaction to the second dose aren't that severe--we're all just getting it at the same time, so it sounds like a lot. I get a similar reaction to my flu shot every year (though I also just get fevers easily)--I just don't talk about it because it's just normal. I've had both doses of Moderna. Almost everyone I know has had at least one dose, many both doses, and while we all texted about some aches and pains and maybe a fever, it wasn't really any worse than any other vaccine--and a hell of a lot better than the COVID patients many of them have taken care of in ICUs.   


mRNA is quite well studied--it's been examined as an excellent mechanism for more than 20 years. There are a host of reasons this is the first available vaccine using this technology, but it wasn't that previous research suggested they weren't safe or could result in mysterious, unknown ""long-term effects."" The vaccine has been absorbed and excreted by your body within days--including the mRNA. The potential for long-term effects that don't start for months or years doesn't have a basis in the science behind these vaccines--or any vaccines.   


Ongoing studies are evaluating how effective one dose is, vs two, but I'd certainly rather go with the current standard that's been evaluated and provides me with the best possibility of protection against a disease that's killed nearly 550,000 Americans and 2.5 million people around the world in a year.",mg2tk4,2021-03-30 14:58:55

"Though this is the first mRNA vaccine, the technology isn’t new. They started researching it in 2002 with SARS and have been since, although not with such vigor as the past year, because SARS and MERS fizzled out much more quickly without such a global impact as covid has. At this point there is nearly a year with very few negative side effects (a very few people had anaphylactic reactions but I think they all had a history of anaphylaxis in the past) and mRNA degrades so quickly in your body, leaving your own cells to finish up the work of producing the spike protein. At least for Pfizer and moderna. The components of the vaccine just aren’t really there for very long term, so it is expected that we won’t see long term side effects years down the road. And I’m addition to the actual clinical trials that the vaccines went through, the CDC invites everyone getting a vaccine to participate in the vsafe program which texted me every day for a bit, then every week, and I think the latest one I got was 6 weeks after my second dose. This helped to rapidly compile more real word data about the types of symptoms people felt after shots.

But we don't live in the wilderness hunting and gathering anymore where anything Unknown could be poisonous or a predator. We have ways of determining through other parties' experience and knowledge if something is dangerous despite being Unknown to us personally. So we don't have to rely on our Instinctual Fear of the Unknown for safety.

Ignore it. It'll keep trying to warn you, thinking this Unknown vaccine is a threat, like those annoying car alarms that won't shut off even though no one is stealing the car. Ignore it.

Scientists noted that all efficacy info based on the trials only represents info for the space in time the trial was done- hence why the latest trials for Johnson and Johnson are showing to be good against the UK variant. 

Its really tough for me to lean towards getting the Vaccine with all this conflicting information, and also because I am able to work from home, properly social distance from my loved ones, and I have a good immune system.

"There is no reason not to get it; yes, the reason they stopped giving it to people is essentially a cost cutting exercise.

TB can be treated with antibiotics. However, in a world where antibiotics are massively overused, and considering the variety of harmful effects that can stem from antibiotic use (including damage to the microbiome) it is obviously far preferable to be vaccinated against a pathogen than to rely on antibiotics to treat it.

On top of all that, the BCG vaccine has been shown to have a wide variety of other benefits. It provides cross-protection against a [wide range](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02806/full) of other pathogens, and thus is associated with lower all-cause child mortality in the developing world. There is even some evidence that it provides some cross-protection against Covid-19.

In short, BCG is perhaps one of the most beneficial vaccines you can get -- not just for its protection against TB, but for a range of other benefits it seems to provide. Personally I've paid for it privately for myself (as I never had it as a child) and I intend to do the same for my children, if I ever have them.",mcsvkl,2021-03-25 10:11:43

"Okay there’s a lot of glowing comments about BCG but the reason why it was determined to be dispensable is that it’s efficacy at preventing TB is highly variable and in general not very good. It is a less than stellar vaccine, it’s about a century old, there are numerous variants so it’s real a crap shoot at preventing TB, that’s why millions still die every year from it and there are large vaccination development efforts underway. So take it with a grain of salt.",mcsvkl,2021-03-27 03:04:45

"That may be the reason in the US, but not in the UK. American public health authorities made a decision decades ago--contrary to the policies of public health authorities of nearly every other country on the planet--that BCG was not worth administering to the population as a whole. There is little point getting into the details of why the Americans decided to go against global best practice. The UK went with the global consensus, not the American opinion, and BCG was part of the standard vaccine schedule in the UK until just a few years ago. It was finally removed because the prevalence of TB in the UK dropped to the point where it was no longer considered to be cost-effective. But what is rational for policymakers is not necessarily rational for individuals.",mcsvkl,2021-03-27 13:21:14

I took Sinopharm. I chose to avoid Sputnik V because the first and second doses are different. This made it a bit less practical for my circumstances.

If you are not planning on traveling and are going to continue being in isolation, I would strongly suggest taking Sputnik V. It is the most effective out of the options listed.

Sinopharm is a tried and tested vaccine technology. It was one of the first covid vaccines to be developed. Its effectiveness however is a little controversial.

AstraZeneca is also a good option. They've had some bad publicity but it is still safe and effective.

It's unknown whether Sinopharm or AstraZeneca are more effective vaccines. Sinopharm has a higher published effectiveness than AstraZeneca, but AstraZeneca's effectiveness is based on more reliable data. Regardless, Sputnik V is more effective than them both.

“This is *an important step the CDC should take to responsibly and effectively* ***reduce the mortality among individuals with disabilities***,” Rep. Katko said in a March 17 statement.

“We believe that by ensuring states receive the recommendation **to include all individuals with I/DD in Phase 1c, and not just individuals in congregate settings**, *they will better be able to address the enhanced risks these individuals face,”* wrote Rep. Katko and the members. “This recommendation should explicitly apply to all persons with I/DD, those living in group homes and other living arrangements.”

Currently, according to their letter, **DSPs often are group home workers and staff or provide services in individual homes or community settings**, yet they are not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to be in Phase 1b vaccinations with other health care personnel.  

**“DSPs should be recognized as the essential health professionals they are and included in Phase 1b** to ensure the individuals they support who are at heightened risk are not further exposed to COVID-19,” the members wrote. ",mbibag,2021-03-23 17:17:01

"Ok so seeing as you’re requesting specifically to be answered by individual with some background on this, I’ll simply add my background here and you can decide for yourself; I’m a biomedical scientist. I focussed on molecular biology for a number of years (Think PCR and Gene Sequencing studies) but my primary role is the application of science to healthcare and as such I’ve taken part in a number of research studies and projects relative to vaccines which I have a personal interest in. 

So I’ll begin by correcting your original comment on the trial time. The vaccine HAS undergone the exact same procedure that any vaccine would undergo during development and approval. The time spent in trial mirrors all of the vaccines you are familiar with. Think about it, we get a flu vaccine every single year without any issues. The difference here is that the Covid vaccines have had billions of dollars thrown at them from numerous countries, and have all had scientific collaboration, the likes of which we have never seen before. Simply because there was such a strong vested effort in its development. 

Secondly, the pharmacokinetic data shows that the vaccine is entirely cleared from the body by 60 days roughly speaking. After that stage, all you’re left with is the bodies immune response to said vaccine. There’s not much point trying to determine long term problems from something that no longer exists within a person. 

As well as this (although not a correction) as you have stated the vaccine is “technically still in trial”. This can be said of any vaccine ever produced. All vaccines enter what is called Phase IV post market surveillance studies once they are released to the public. This means they are very closely monitored for safety and efficacy issues as well creating an open chain of communication between the clinicians and the pharmaceutical companies for whatever they may need. Don’t let this terminology of “experimental vaccine” scare you. It’s a load of bull. 

The indemnity issue is a non-issue. It’s not a scientific issue it’s a legal and business based issue. You will often see this spun by anti-vaccine enthusiasts that this is proof vaccines are unsafe. This is complete nonsense. Companies are given immunity from civil prosecution because they are bound by a separate piece of legislation. This means that in order to prevent a breach of double jeopardy, they are given civil immunity. 

So to answer your final question ultimately, yes it completely viable to suggest there would be no reason to be worried about long term side effects of the vaccine for many of the reasons stated above.",m98yy7,2021-03-20 23:24:00

"Thank you for taking the time to write that.

It's a lot to digest and I don't understand all of it, but I'll come back to it once I've done some more reading.

But it'd be interesting to hear what you think about the number of cycles that's been run in detecting Covid in subjects using PCR up until relatively recently. From what I understand, many people have criticized this from quite early on, but, for some reason, the guidelines or protocols in the US have only fairly recently been adjusted (though I'm not sure), so I'm curious about that.",m98yy7,2021-03-22 00:54:32
"Have you found any studies showing the tissue trafficking of the LNPs used by Pfizer and Moderna.  My concern revolves around a possible memory CD8 T cell response against non-immune cells presenting spike protein through MHC-1.  I found animal models using luciferase that showed tracking of LNPs to various non-lymphoid tissues, but there lipid composition of the LNP was different.  I know lipids can transport viral components to cells normally not infected.  Back in 1978 I was able to transport dsDNA of vaccinia virus into a cell line normally not infected by the virus, measured by plaque assay.  So if the LNPs in mRNA boosters transport to unintentional targets, that could be problematic. 

Also it has been many years since my basic science studies and I have a question.  It has been suggested that in ramping up the scale of in vitro mRNA production that an increased amount of small linear DNA sequences are still present after purification.  If the purification process uses molecular weight or buoyant density I don’t see how that would be possible.   And even if it was in the final product, wouldn’t restriction endonucleases needed to be provided before host insertion would occur.",m98yy7,2021-04-17 04:50:01
"That's true. The flu and even the common cold can have severe effects, same with Covid.",m98yy7,2021-03-21 01:57:30
"This one is going to be a much shorter comment because the simple answer is that there is very little wrong with the cycle thresholds being used. The thing about people complaining about the cycle thresholds is that I’ve never yet had someone who understands PCR complain about it. 

You need to know that in order to actually amplify a PCR product, you have to design primers capable of binding to the region you want to amplify. If your primers don’t bind you can’t get any product out. You can set the cycle threshold to 100 cycles if you want and not see anything at all.",m98yy7,2021-03-22 19:25:03
"Thanks for your comment, there are a couple of great questions there! 

So the primary effort here in terms of target cells is the dendritic cells which have a very high affinity for the LNPs. When you couple that high affinity with the extremely low affinity of other cells such as endothelial tissues for example, it’s very unlikely that there would be any recognition of the mRNA or the consequent spike proteins on cells other than those found in circulation. On top of that, let’s say for whatever reason one of the LNPs manages to extravasate from circulation and comes into contact with some other cell type and that said cell type actually manages to incorporate the LNP and express the spike protein. The likelihood of recognition as a PAMP here is extremely low. None of the dendritic cells will be extravasating to recognise this cell expressing spike protein. What’s more likely is a self-regulated apoptotic event controlling the cell(s) affected. 

Now this would of course be very location specific but say again for example the endothelial cells that take up the LNP are respiratory tract endothelium. Well this would simply enhance the response to the vaccine in the same way that getting a respiratory tract infection causes an immune response. It wouldn’t be detrimental in any way. 

On to your question of ramping up. You’re absolutely right that this has been a concern but I would side with yourself on saying the likelihood of problematic, retained DNA sequences is fairly slim. The issue is primarily a product of how molecular weight specificity margins of error increase significantly the more of the product you produce so the question remains how much RNA can you produce until you can’t really tell if there’s a strand or two of DNA amongst the haystack so to speak. I think we have some very strong purification processes and as you say, simply introducing DNA into a host doesn’t automatically mean it will be reintegrated. In fact it’s extremely likely to be destroyed almost immediately as opposed to ever making it to any sort of target and then managing to be integrated to a host genome.",m98yy7,2021-04-17 09:05:38
"Since you told us you’re biased for vaccines I am not surprised by your answers. They are they usual talking points. Sadly, they don’t reflect the reality of the thousands of doctors and scientists that are credentialed in vaccines who are extremely concerned about this vaccine. First off, this is not a flu vaccine. Just like cv19 isn’t the flu. There are NO mRNA vaccines on the market, therefore no historical data to refer to. Furthermore, there absolutely are concerns about the length of the trials, as NO longitudinal studies are complete. 
To this specific comment, you have a major error in claiming PCR has no complaints since the man who  CREATED IT has always said it is NOT a diagnostic tool. It is a research tool. He very strongly was critical of dr Fauci’s use of pcr since he began using it as a means to diagnose HIV. And everyone doing pcr lab work knows the way to manipulate the results is the number of cycles. If there is no industry standard for an exact range of appropriate cycles can can there be a standard for diagnosis?",m98yy7,2021-03-27 21:50:10
"I knew that the primary affinity is for the dendritic cells, but I also know that there has been an abundance of LNP work years ago showing enhanced transport of neurological medication across the blood brain barrier, albeit the lipids were different.  I have not seen any animal model studies showing the current LNPs carrying the mRNA having a lower affinity for endothelial and other cells.   That’s the data I am looking for.  Also why would pattern recognition be low, does PAMP vary according to tissue type?",m98yy7,2021-04-17 14:43:36
"Nowhere did I say it was the flu vaccine but feel free to play the straw man fallacy for a bit longer if it makes you feel better about your argument. 

We have data on mRNA vaccine vectors from the 80s my man. We attempted to develop mRNA vaccines for both SARS and MERS. 

You also are badly off the mark with regards to Kary Mullis’ commentary on PCR. For a start, you say I have a major error but you fail to demonstrate any error in my argument. I would start there. I never claimed it wasn’t primarily a research tool. That doesn’t mean it has zero potential for diagnostics. In fact PCR is commonly used in diagnostics but as a SOLE diagnostic test. But then you obviously know all about that seeing as you’re here trying to tell me all about this. 

It’s nearly like there’s no industry standard for cycle thresholds because it’s entirely dependant on the copy numbers in the host genome. Who would have thought? 

You have come in here and made numerous points that amount to absolutely nothing. If you wish to talk about the complexities of PCR methodology then by all means discuss them here with me now and we can go into detail. But don’t sit here and pretend you know more than you’re letting on when you can’t even form a coherent argument, and you’re putting words in people’s mouths to make your own arguments sound better than they are.",m98yy7,2021-03-27 22:04:33
"The virus contains multiple targets for your immune system, for example spike protein and nucleoprotein among others. The vaccines contain spike protein but do not contain nucleoprotein. If you test for NP, which nearly all commercial tests do, you will not be positive following vaccine(since they don’t contain NP) but you would be positive post infection because SARS-CoV2 does contain NP.",m98bf3,2021-03-20 23:34:23

"I understand your feelings, there is a lot of stress and insecurity right now, we are all (more or less) subconciously looking for things to ""blame"" the stress on. That is human. But take a deep breath and evaluate it logically. 

Numbers: there are 15 cases of blood clots that have been reported after an AstraZeneca vaccination. This is compared to ca 17 000 000 doses of AstraZeneca. Even IF they would be connected, that is an incidence of ca 0.0001 %. That is a super low number.

In comparison, eating the contraceptove pill gives a thousand times higher risk of blood clots (incidence ca 0,1%). This number is confirmed. Yet hundreds of millions of people take the contraceptive every day, no panic about that.

So facts and pleading for people to care about other's health more than their preferences has been my tactic. Each year I get about 3-4 people who contact me telling me they've never gotten the flu shot for whatever reason but my posts convinced them to get it. It's always a good feeling.

it's *possible* but extremely unlikely. As always, we don't have accurate numbers on the protection capabilities of each flu vaccine until after the flu season.

You are right that H5N8 is not included as a consideration for the 20-21 flu vaccine. All signs point to almost certainly not protective based on what we know about H and N subtypes, but there is no evidence to confirm that.",m69b2e,2021-03-16 18:37:38

"We were discussing the idea of nucleic acid based vaccines 20 years ago. I don’t recall seeing much in textbooks, but the idea of delivering a gene to a cell for a vaccine is somewhat similar to gene therapy. Developing a DNA based vaccine seemed like something that would probably happen one day.

RNA has certain traits that make it unstable and a pain in the ass to work with. RNA vaccines weren’t going to happen because of it.

Then scientists were able to stabilize RNA for gene therapy and vaccine development.

Developing a new vaccine takes a lot of time and a lot of money. Making a new mRNA based vaccine for a disease that already has a vaccine is not a good use of resources.

This was a case of infinite demand, infinite money, and a completely new disease.",m57f97,2021-03-15 05:10:35

Our bodies are amazing machines and just like we can work out and feel a little tired, we are still building strong, fit bodies. It’s the same for antibodies. The vaccines are the work out for our immune system so it can also be fit and healthy and fight illness.

When we are vaccinated our immune system builds the antibodies needed to fight the illness. BUT our immune system’s do more than that - they remember what antibodies we created to fight that illness. That means that even though your daughter has (thankfully) never had whooping cough, her body knows how to fight whooping cough. That’s a huge win!!!

You did good, mom!! There are many times in parenthood that we break the chain and it sounds like you did it perfectly by talking to the pediatrician and planning a catch-up schedule.",m3voz0,2021-03-16 00:40:32

"The ASEAN countries are not all rich, though some are. Indian is in a position to help with the vaccine manufacture that America has produced; Japan can provide the other infrastructure and other support materials and of course lot of financial help is needed in distribution and vaccination. America, Australia and the USA can make it possible to deliver the billion jabs. I am sure this arrangement is in the best interests of the countries. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine appears to be most appropriate because it is single dose and temperature requirements are not critical. Let's hope for the best outcome.",m3wqhj,2021-03-13 09:07:01

I just lucked out going through CVS’s web site. Followed the NJ Vaccine Bot on Twitter that revealed when new appointments were available and then clicked for about an hour until a time came up. Their site happens to show the vaccine you’re signing up for. My wife happens to be getting the Pfizer one... seems like it’s still a toss-up based on what’s available.

"I never had a flu shot until I got flu one year. My fever was so high, my husband took me to emerg. I couldn't tolerate Tamiflu, it made me throw up non stop, so I stopped it after 3 doses. It wasn't good timing at all, my husband had to go away for 2 weeks for work. After dropping me off at emerg, he took our daughter to my parents, then drove back to pick me up and then he pretty much had to go. I was alone and super sick. Even though I had very limited contact with my daughter after I felt sick, I managed to infect her and she infected my parents. Everyone recovered, but it's 10 days just to feel ok, and then another month of coughing. 

Now I get flu shot every year. And I got my covid vaccine, because I work in the hospital. I am prone to colds, stuffy nose and cough infections though, if there was a vaccine for common cold, I would totally take it!",lzx1zj,2021-03-08 04:29:33

A couple years ago my whole family got the flu, and while it never got dangerous and we didn't infect any elderly family members, it sucked! It took us over a week to get over it! That combined with all the reading about flu that I've done during this pandemic...shows me that the flu shot really is worth getting! It's stupid that so many people die of this when we've got a vaccine! It's important for ""healthy"" people like you and I to do our part in protecting the at-risk groups around us!

The pharmacist who gave me the shot told me before hand of these side effects were likely (one study said 92% of recipients mention muscle pain or soreness at the injection site) He sat with me for 15 minutes after the shot to observe if I had any bad reaction and told me if I got the soreness to throw a bag of frozen peas on my arm.

No need to get tested unless you have symptoms. There would be no risk in getting the vaccine even if you did have asymptomatic COVID.,lyird3,2021-03-07 18:00:07
"The J&J vaccine has been tested and those results show that those who do get coronavirus after they receive this vaccine have milder symptoms. So your summation is correct. I believe (not proven but from my understanding) that you are less likely to have some of the longer-term symptoms that you stated. However, one important aspect to note is that the vaccine will allow your body to have a higher chance of recognition for the virus so you are less likely to contract it, and therefore have a lower likelihood of suffering from lingering effects. Herd immunity is more known with other viruses, such as the flu. However, since coronavirus has all of these variants, a lot of them making it easier to contract, herd immunity is not something to rely on and should not be a reason why you do not get the vaccine. Different areas of the country have different strains of the virus and although right now they are all controlled under the vaccines, that might not always be the case.

I would recommend taking whatever vaccine comes to you, but do not be too worried about efficacy. The more people who get vaccinated, the less likely you are to contract the virus in general and any vaccine that protects your body is important.

"Government has already ordered millions of doses from Pfizer and Moderna; more than likely J&J will fill in the gap where the other two cannot.

J&J will definitely be used in the US to some extent but I think it is mostly going to be exported to poorer countries due to its lower cost and logistical issues and you only need one jab.

I called around a bit and I was able to find both Moderna and Pfizer being offered in my area so I had a choice. I suggest OP  do you the same if you are in the United States

"Impossible to say without knowing why you get “feverish.” Flu, yes. Most other common viruses, no. Is it possible your allergies are impacting you worse than you realized?

"An allergy is your body’s immune response to an allergen. An immune response can trigger symptoms of a cold or flu. Flu vaccine would help if you came into contact with the flu virus, your body wouldn’t have to fight as hard against both allergies and flu. 

Truly any vaccine is helpful in warding off illness. If you’re immune system is continually fighting allergies, it will have to work harder to fight allergies and illness preventable by vaccine. 
 
You may also ask your doctor if the Pneumovax vaccine is right for you. Typically you would be under a doctors care for a little while in order for the doctor to make that determination. 

I truly appreciate that you’ve benefitted from herd immunity for so long and I really encourage you to stay on top of your vaccinations. Most adults greatly benefit from an annual flu shot and a Tdap vaccine (every 10 years), but I encourage you to review the full vaccine schedule at the link I’m posting.[cdc adult vaccine schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html)

"I while it hasn’t been studied, I don’t think that there will be a problem with taking both as long as separated by a few months. People that have had covid are instructed to do the same. But is it worth it? Both the mRNA vaccines and the J&J vaccine are very good vaccines and I didn’t suspect that you will be put at any risk by taking the J&J vaccine.",lwgtz5,2021-03-03 01:14:47
"It’s likely we’re going to end up getting boosters down the line either from the vaccine’s effect not lasting or from new versions of the vaccine to protect against new variants. Also, the medical consensus afaik is jnj’s results can’t be compared to Pfizer/Moderna directly because of the different study conditions, especially with emerging variants. And also, JNJ’s protection from death was 100%.",lwgtz5,2021-03-03 01:40:46
"Right now in my experience for the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine you have to register and provide name, address, DOB, (MediCARE card in some situations), phone # & email address in order to get a booking for most sites. And then when you get shot #1, you get a CDC vaccine record card with your name & DOB and the specific lot # that was given to you. So your pretty much a known entity. It will be just a few keystrokes to find out which shot you got and when and where.  Janssen J&J is just ramping up to get wide distribution but they will have to do a verification process like what Pfizer & Moderna has. Again just a few keystrokes and you’ll be found out. 

Even the big cities that are trying to do large # of vaccines are still requiring info to be filled out. Maybe not requiring you to show a driver’s license but need something with your name & address. The states get vaccines based on population so they have to be able to show a physical address in the state of those getting a vaccine to be compliant with federal distribution of the vaccines. Some states require a on physician letterhead the reason why you are eligible if not in group 1A or 1B, other states you can self certify but you do check off what “reason” it is & sign that it is accurate. 

Btw I was on the Janssen trial and got unblinded last month. It was the saline shot and the trial center couldn’t give me a fixed date for getting the real shot. ((Which is kinda egregious imho)). Was able to book for & just got my first Moderna. I would have been totally happy with the Janssen as it’s shown really well for the So Africa variant. Really take the first shot that your offered.",lwgtz5,2021-03-04 00:54:16
Minimal risks of taking both but i wouldn't mix them. The rna transcripts are different and so you will have partial immunity instead of full immunity thanks to one transcript.,lwgtz5,2021-03-05 07:11:49

"Interesting. I thought that the J&J vaccine used 293 cells to produce the adenovirus. Although the other big adenovirus producing cell line is what they used, both are embryonic derived cell lines.

Personally I think that even the discussion of 293 cells in bemchwork and early preclinical development of mRNA vaccines is more of a red herring. Cell lines like 293 cells are used all the time for plenty of reasons. I’m sure they used several cell lines and bacterial strains along the way to developing a product. That being said, 293 cells are absolutely NOT used in the production of mRNA vaccines.

In any event, these cell lines are decades old and are far removed from their source. I’m not sure if they were from elective abortions, medically necessary abortions, or miscarriages. The Catholic Church is more concerned with saving the lives of millions than the cell lines in any event.",lwgf0d,2021-03-03 01:24:07

The only downsides I can think of are needing to get the two doses for the higher efficacy. There's always a rare possibility of reactions but most are very temporary and mild.

I also had shingles the summer when I was 17.

"I'd definitely weigh up the pros and cons,  the Varicella vaccine isn't in circulation as (unless risk to those immuno suppressed) chicken pox is usually 'mild' (as in kids have a terrible itchy rash but don't become massively unwell) with very rare complications and it's unlikely they'll contract the virus again. The vaccine itself protects for 10-20 years, or at least what I've read and the virus is much worse for adults.

"I'm assuming by ""it"" you're referring to chickenpox and not the chickenpox vaccine? You cannot get shingles without having had chickenpox. The virus that causes chickenpox remains in your body the rest of your life and can reemerge as shingles. The chickenpox vaccine, especially with both doses, has an extremely high efficacy rate so the chance of still getting it are tiny. If you avoid getting chickenpox, you'll also avoid having shingles.

"That's extremely unlikely. A few adults who were vaccinated as children have gotten chickenpox when exposed to outbreaks but that is very rare. The vaccine still provides protection even if it's not as robust 20+ years later. That is why it's not recommended that adults be vaccinated if they were vaccinated as children, unless they are immune compromised or will be in an area where outbreaks are still common. 

It began being administered in the US in the mid-90s and rapidly reduced outbreaks by a signifiant extent. Since most who were vaccinated were young children there hasn't yet been enough time to know how well the protection will be when they're over the age of 50. But outbreaks have become rarer and rarer. Hopefully by the time your kids are middle-aged chickenpox will be so uncommon there will be very little risk of them ever being exposed to it. Their greatest risk of getting chickenpox is in their childhood so you are right to get them vaccinated.",lvk70y,2021-03-02 18:29:46

"It depends on the definition that they used, which will be specific to the trial. Since there haven’t been any documents released yet (as far as I know), we can’t know for sure, but I’d bet that their definition of “severe disease” includes *any* SOB, whether or not you need hospitalization. That could fall under “severe systemic illness”.",lu264s,2021-02-28 02:31:51
"PCR looks for the nucleic acid. The vaccines (at least the presently available mRNA ones) only code for spike protein. There are a lot more virus  genes than just that one. If you ran a PCR looking for JUST the spike nucleic acid, it would be positive. However, the people who design these tests understand that... So, the PCR tests use other primers (different starting points for the PCR) looking for other ""parts"" of the viral genome.

Simple summary, a PCR test can differentiate between someone who has been vaccinated or who actually has the live virus. Don't stress about that.

Also, the immunity tests look at antibodies OTHER than for spike-protein. That means that serological tests can tell the difference too.

Everyone assumes that the vaccine will reduce the viral load in an infection, but we don't know the extent of how well that works... just that it looks like it prevents disease. Even if you have been vaccinated, it is best to not let your guard down, especially around the more vulnerable and/or unvaccinated.

If you HAVE been vaccinated and subsequently got a positive PCR test, that could mean two things. 1) It is a false positive, which is actually fairly common and you should get re-tested. 2) You are in fact carrying the virus asymptomatically, and should self-isolate.",ltbral,2021-02-27 18:38:12
"I think so,  it this is based on my understanding that CoV-2 NC antibodies will still develop since your body only has antibodies for S1, S1S2, RBD, and s2 (different parts of the virus). So your body still responds to it, and still develops immunity, the vaccine just gives you a much better fighting chance at it since it recognizes 80% of it. If this is wrong, someone please correct me because this is how I understand it.",ltbral,2021-02-27 05:01:38
"The PCR result will show positive if you do contract the virus, however it could also show negative. The RT-PCR test looks for pieces of the viral RNA after a swab is taken. An antigen test is another way to test whether you have COVID. However, the reason that you might get a negative when you have the virus is because these cannot always be detected as soon as you are infected. Some tests are also less effective than others. 

However, the vaccine will not affect your results, because the only thing the vaccine does is ready's your body to fight off the possible viral infection.",ltbral,2021-03-09 23:22:27
"The vaccine does not contain living subjects of covid 19.  
It contains RNA, which builds itself into a few muscle cells and will make them produce the 'Spike protein', which is only a part of the virus.  
This while triggering a strong immune reaction if healthy, Is a good thing, as there is no way you can spread a dead virus.",ltbral,2021-03-04 21:16:06
"I’ve been confused by this repeated statement that nobody knows if the vaccines reduce viral load (i.e someone’s ability to spread the disease to others). I understand that was not confirmed via clinical trials (and would likely be hard to do since so few vaccinated people will get a confirmed Covid diagnosis. However, when we say that we are trying to reach herd immunity via vaccinations, are we not assuming that a vaccinated individual cannot become infected and spread the virus?",ltbral,2021-03-06 01:29:10
You guys don’t understand my question I mean that after I get the vaccine and it’s good it works but I contract COVID-19 from someone else. Will the Covid show in PCR or will my immunized body eliminate it in a day,ltbral,2021-03-04 21:19:24
"We ASSUME it will dramatically reduce viral load, and that is a very safe assumption. The danger is in telling people that they are 100% protected from transmitting the disease to others when we don't know that for sure. I think public health workers just want to error on the side of caution for the time being. My guess is that once you have a strong antibody response from the vaccine (that takes time), your transmission rate will be functionally zero. 

To clarify, the vaccine will 1) reduce viral load, and 2) prevent disease. Just keep in mind that those to things are separate results and neither is guaranteed 100%.",ltbral,2021-03-06 16:00:15

It takes a mass of people thinking and planning strategically on where are you going to store those raw materials, under what conditions so that the can be inspected and released in plant at the right time

And it’s not just microbiologists, it’s molecular biologists chemists, chemical engineers and just regular old STEM degrees out in the floor ( non STEM I know a few art and history majors who make vaccines ) - it’s kind of cool seeing how everyone looks at a process a little different - makes for good brainstorming for improvement",ltcygk,2021-02-27 02:28:06

The vaccines in this case generate a protein from the surface of the virus and that protein accumulates on the surface of transfected cells where antibodies have easy access.

I’m not sure if an mRNA vaccine against an unenveloped virus would work as well.  It probably would.

But the other issue with this approach for polio is that we already have an excellent inactivated polio vaccine that provides <99% protection against paralytic poliomyelitis, even if its effects on transmission are modest.  The oral polio vaccine, the one that can give you polio, provides protection from transmission.  It’s not clear that an mRNA poliovirus vaccine would provide any better mucosal immunity.

There is work on nOPV, a novel OPV that is much less likely to revert to wild-type and cause paralysis.  

But you ask an excellent question.  One of my nightmares is a pandemic novel picornavirus (polio is a picornavirus).  Depending on the nature of the virus, this could be truly devastating because unlike coronaviruses, picornavirus particles are notoriously sturdy and resistant to many common disinfectants.  Norovirus, a calicivirus closely related to the picornaviruses, is only destroyed by boiling, bleach, incineration, or long-term exposure to high-intensity UV light.  Standard disinfectants like “LYSOL” or alcohol hand gel have little effect.

If we do see a novel pandemic picornavirus, we’ll need to have strategies ready to rapidly develop vaccines and I wonder if mRNA will work as well.",lszsdd,2021-02-26 17:23:52
"The general public doesn’t know this, but we have been studying the concept of nucleic acid vaccines for years. I got my PhD in 2001 and we were discussing the concept in immunology class, in the lab, and over drinks. Actually a lot of ideas come out that way (hey, what do you think would happen if...).

The problem with RNA vaccines was the stability. I used lipids to deliver DNA countless times, but RNA is unstable. Well...we found a way to stabilize it. Companies were just waiting to try the things but we have plenty of vaccines and sometimes you don’t fix what isn’t broken because that’s a lot of time and money. 

Guess what happened when there was a brand new virus with no vaccine and vaccine companoes basically got billions to solve the problem RIGHT NOW...? 

Anyway, the RNA is designed to produce the spike protein a couple hundred times per cell. This is a molecular biology thing and relates to something called a polyadenylation sequence. So your cells produce spike protein a couple hundred times until the RNA is degraded or your immune system kills the cell. Both are good.

You don’t end up with some sort of weird infection from it. It’s actually safer than attenuated virus vaccines despite being theoretically as effective. The fertility thing has been debunked as well.

I got my Pfizer five months ago in the trial. My 12 year old daughter just had her second moderna in the older kids trial. I wouldn’t have let her do it if I thought there was a risk.

"I’m a hospital pharmacist and I’ve been giving the Covid vaccines and keeping up with the research coming out. 
I’m not concerned about long term side effects because we are only having two exposures to the drug( until Johnson and Johnson is approved) It’s important to understand that in order to have a therapeutic or adverse effect, you ultimately need chemicals in the body to interact with receptors or tissues. We know nothing in the vaccine is going to last more than a few days based on the components half lives. The only thing that persists in the long term is the immune response your body makes.
Long term side effects from medications happen either when you are consistently taking a drug for many months to years or the drug damages a certain part of the body in the short term. Either from an inappropriately high dose or certain drugs are just immediately damaging to tissues (many chemotherapies).
In my opinion, this is one of the safest vaccines ever developed. Additionally, the ability to rapidly change the mRNA class will change the way we fight viruses like influenza and COVID forever.",lsm2s8,2021-02-26 13:23:33

"Rhino viruses seem to be tricky because there are so many of them. I’d like to see a mRNA vaccine that targets a conserved region of the virus. I’m not sure if we would need more of a cytotoxic T cell response alone or if we will also need an antibody response. I definitely think that given the new interest in vaccines, there could be good funding for a multivalent cold vaccine. Just think of how much the economy suffers each year when employees are sick at home...

HIV infects the very cells that are necessary for coordination of the immune system so that HIV can be killed. The HIV-1 protein known as Nef, is known to inhibit the functionality of the T cell receptor. The HIV-1 Vpu protein down regulates CD4 expression. All of this hinders an effective immune response. Obviously there is the entire DNA integration issue where the HIV genome actually inserts itself into your DNA and can’t be removed. 

I do think we will develop a vaccine of some sorts that allows people to be infected but never pass it on to someone or become sick from it, but clinical trials for a disease that will kill you is difficult.",lsm2s8,2021-03-10 04:44:55

"It's somewhat frightening being on the vanguard of scientific discovery, isn't it?   


I keep thinking about the polio vaccine. My mother was a child, and her parents didn't hesitate to line up with her and her sister in a line several blocks long to get their kids this brand-new vaccine. Polio had scared parents all over the country for several years. Swimming pools and movie theaters were closed during summers at times because of polio outbreaks. This vaccine was a miracle, just as the covid vaccine is. We got super lucky that scientists had been working on vaccines for similar viruses for a few years before covid-19 was a thing, because that gave them a head start on this. 

I got my second shot last week, and, despite having several pre-existing conditions, I am fine, and I am looking forward to being able to leave my house for more than just doctor's appointments! I will still wear a mask and socially distance, though, because apparently the jury is still out as to whether you can still carry the virus if you're vaccinated, and I don't want to inadvertently give it to my family.",lr7zq0,2021-02-24 12:09:38

It’s a standard designation that means that all production on everything else has been ceased and everything is now focused on the product (in this case, the vaccine) in question. Science still is taking place at the same speeds, but now it LOOKS faster because more hands are on deck. 

It’s like when you’re washing the dishes and you have a friend who comes to help dry. Everything suddenly is done quicker because of the extra set of hands.

That was a few months ago, since then they did all get it.

"There were 23 people in Pfizer’s phase III trial who got pregnant during the trial (12 in the vaccine group, 11 in the placebo group). 2 people had adverse events, but both of those were in the placebo group. See pg. 42: https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download

Of course in a real infection lots of cells are destroyed too (well, hopefully =P), so there's no way around that in either way anyway.

May I also ask do this infection mostly happen in the skin or is it transferred by blood to the rest of the body and in the case of those specific cells (are they? The d* cells?) possibly mostly in the skin are they replenished by fresh ones either developed in that area or transported there by the body again? Because I guess that's one difference in that maybe the infection happen mostly in the arm in this case or if it's transported in the body where's otherwise I guess mostly / at first in the lungs.

So many people were social distancing, hand washing more often, wearing masks, etc. which decreases the chances that any viral infection, such as the flu, will be spread. I do not think you would need to get another shot for the flu because it has been such a mild year and more than likely less mutation than normal due to it being a milder year and with increased precautions.

Of all the data we have, we know the vaccine acts as a booster. Additionally, we don’t have a ton of data to support how long our antibodies protect post-infection.

To help, here is the link to the CDC site and the text to support why you should get the vaccine post-infection:

Data from clinical trials indicate that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can safely be given to persons with evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination should be offered to persons regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.[CDC Covid Vaccine info](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)",lhdms9,2021-02-12 03:55:06

There isn’t a ton of data showing anything about boosting with another brand and that’s why you have doctors referring you to other doctors.

We do have data showing the currently approved vaccines are effective in creating antibodies and the CDC recommends we continue to stay vigilant with masking, social distancing, hand washing and other safety measures even after vaccination.

"Contrary to the misleading media coverage, there is no evidence that AstraZeneca is ineffective against severe cases of any variants of Covid. The much-reported recent study in South Africa was far too small to give conclusive results, and it only looked at protection against mild infections, not severe ones. It is far too early to say whether AstraZeneca protects against the new mutations, and we certainly cannot say it is 'not very useful'.

All that being said, it's true that we do not yet know the effects of mixing different Covid vaccines. However, there is some preliminary evidence that it may offer more protection than one kind of vaccine alone, and in fact, the highly effective Russian vaccine (Sputnik) actually consists of a combination of two different vaccines.

Day 0: Received vaccine

Day 1: mildly sore arm at injection site and tired as the day went on - consistent with other vaccines

Day 2: woke up sore in neck, shoulders, hips, and knees. This soreness aligns with the lymph nodes and is a normal immune response. Headache, no fever, and a lot more tired than Day 1.  By mid-day I had a splitting headache and nausea. I took the rest of the day off and went to bed. Stayed hydrated, rested, ate healthy to give my body what it needed to ramp up antibodies. The only unexpected reaction was what I call an ""ear fever"". I did not have a fever with a temporal thermometer, but my ears where bright red and hot to the touch. 

Day 3: woke up mildly sore  - same as day 2, but less intense. By mid-day the headache was back and became more pronounced throughout the day. No nausea, and mild sensitivity to light. Went to bed early to give my body the rest it needed and stayed hydrated and fed.

Day 4: mild headache this afternoon - better than yesterday. Still a little tired and run down, but looking forward to resting through the weekend. 

Day 2 was the worst for me. I have a high threshold for pain so I didn't take anything for relief as I wanted the most antibodies possible. Day 3 was not great, but I made it through a work day.

"The vaccine does two very important things:


1) In clinical trials even the very few who got an infection after being vaccinated had mild cases.  That means no in-patient hospital stay, no oxygen, no intubation, etc.  That's a big fucking deal right now.  

2) Once enough people are protected from serious infection, life can go back to normal even if the virus still spreads.  Herd immunity doesn't require 100% immunity to be effective, and I believe the current consensus is that 70% is enough for coronavirus.  

Basically with enough people vaccinated Covid19 becomes like the flu",lcesa3,2021-02-04 14:20:43
">I read one might still get Covid after the vaccine, just with milder symptoms.

This is also true of influenza. Better to have a mild illness and recover than get severely sick and potentially die, yes? (I'm glossing over the risk factor caveat that would make potential death pretty rare if you have no risk factors, but very relevant if you do have those risk factors, #1 risk factor being age)

>Apparently it takes some weeks for the body to build immunity.

Yes, that is common for actually a lot of viruses. The immune system is complicated.

>Does that statement imply infection only during the immunity-building-phase or even after?

On average, that would imply infection is possible after vaccination but before your body is able to generate a large enough population of antibodies that specifically ""recognize"" sars-cov-2. That is the major milestone of the adaptive immune response to confer immunity. Nothing in biology is perfect because organisms are remarkably complex and remarkably imperfect machines.

>What's meant by ""immunity"" then?

Good question!
There is a range of possible meanings of immunity, but in this context, the two important ideas are protective immunity and sterilizing immunity. 

Imagine a vertical scale with sterilizing immunity at the very top. That immunity is extremely strong. It's the kind where you get an illness once and if you survive you never have to worry about it again. Your body becomes so adept at recognizing and clearing out that particular antigen that it can never gain a foothold again (unless your immune system is compromised by something). 

Protective immunity is a bit further down on that scale. It is an immunity level where your immune response can protect against severe disease, but not necessarily infection. Remember that the immune system can and will kill you if left unchecked. A healthy immune system is one of balance. Responding to bad pathogens and letting healthy microbiota coexist (you have a lot of bacteria and viruses just in and around you at all times, some good some bad). Protective immunity is good because it protects you, but doesn't necessarily prevent you from having an active infection and shedding virus. So yes, protecting immunity can be synonymous with asymptomatic infection.

The rub with this virus is that it seems to be very infectious or at least has the potential to be extremely infectious in certain individuals, even without symptoms. Protecting immunity for you, while good, doesn't necessarily stop the spread. Stopping the spread is the goal.

>I also heard the vaccine will not last long term.

This is where we have good news. We have evidence that vaccine-induced immunity generates antibody levels that are comparable to (and usually significantly higher than) antibody levels seen in patients who have had natural infections. We can't draw a straight line from antibody level to what kind of immunity someone will have (like I said, complicated) but it is very good news.

Secondly, we only have evidence that vaccine-induced immunity lasts a certain time because that's what was measured. Keep in mind that these vaccines have only existed for roughly a year. We can't extrapolate the ""life span"" of an antibody signal because it is physically impossible until that time has passed. Good scientific evidence needs to be falsifiable and we can't falsifiably predict things like that. Based on what I've read so far about the mRNA vaccines, there is no evidence so far of waning immunity *on average*. There may be some people who have dipped over time (and thats definitely true for natural infections) but we don't know if that dips over the threshold of protective immunity or not. This will require more time to figure out.

>So how is the vaccination actually helping in the grand scheme?

Preventing severe illness and stopping community spread, which is when someone is infected and doesn't know where they were exposed.

>Will we need to get annual vaccinations in the future and at some point covid is gone or what is the ultimate goal?

Personally, I don't think so. Once we can reduce active infections to a lower level and get enough people vaccinated, it will be less of a worry. It will likely still be around for a very long time, because that's what infectious diseases do. We've only eradicated 1 pathogen in human history and it was a truly terrifying disease. Bubonic plague is still out there, HIV is still out there. 

With some last good news, I can say that coronaviruses have more stable genomes than viruses like influenza. You've seen some stuff in the news about genomic variants of concern I'm sure. Those are of concern, but that happens with all microbes. If we can get the active infections under control, it will become even more stable because I virus cannot mutate if it cannot replicate (by infecting). The ultimate goal is still in flux. Some doctors want a ""covid-zero"" strategy. Some just want it under control and manageable because that seems possible at least. Vaccines will be a huge help in either strategy.

Hopefully, this answers your questions but let me know if not.",lcesa3,2021-02-04 16:44:47
"Thank you very much for your thorough answer, I appreciate it a lot!

So far I understood immunity as a static condition; great to learn something here. Is the covid vaccine meant to give sterilising immunity, with an unknown effectivity on the individual level, or is it meant to ""only"" give protective immunity to begin with? Could some people develop sterilising immunity from it?",lcesa3,2021-02-05 08:49:51
"So the clinical trials for the rna vaccines were only tracking the end points of serious disease, which they are very good at preventing. That is at least protective immunity. It may be more than that, potentially in certain individuals as you suggest. Unfortunately we can't know that yet. My guess is somewhere in between the two, but that's just a gut feeling based on the antibody levels I've heard about from vaccinated people.",lcesa3,2021-02-07 06:12:49
"_Viruses_ modify DNA. If you've ever had Chicken Pox, then your cells permanently have chicken pox DNA in them and it can be activated by nerve damage -- that's what causes Shingles.

The vaccine is a tool to protect you from permanent viral damage. It does that by temporarily giving you some RNA (this does not get permanently attached to your DNA). This lets your immune system examine the proteins attached to the virus and learn to defend you from it.

This is a very specific part of the virus, one that cannot change and still be effective for attacking humans. That in turn makes it so the immunity you get is very reliable and protects against multiple variants of the disease.

The whole reason you need two shots is because the RNA doesn't stick around. The body needs two exposures to the viral protein in order to store the immunity long-term.

EDIT: See below, I was wrong.",lbwvih,2021-02-03 20:23:38
"""The only time that anyone has had their DNA changed was a few years ago. His name was Peter Parker, he was bitten by a radioactive spider...""

"For lots of reasons, but mainly because the mRna in the vaccine is only the instructions to generate the spike protein for Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus. The vaccine is a much shorter sequence than the virus.  The spike protein can be thought of as the key that unlocks the cell so that the virus can enter. 

The mRna in the vaccine doesn't code for the coat proteins (protects the  or the viral payload) or the viral payload itself (the part that takes over the cell and generates new viruses). The spike protein does nothing by itself.",lbrv3z,2021-02-03 17:04:05
"mRNA can be translated in any actively dividing cell (vast majority of them). 

Since the mRNA is unable to replicate (because it is lacking the rest of the virus genome) it transfects (NOT infects) a portion of cells to produce the spike protein. Not necessarily immune cells. 

The spike proteins are produced are largely inert. Maybe they're presented on a cell? maybe they just aggregate and are slowly extruded? Maybe they cause the transfected to lyse (not a big deal)? Not sure what exactly happens at that point and I don't know if that is known. The simple explanation is that the spike protein is present in the body without any viral machinery behind it to infect or replicate.

It's at that point that the immune response begins against the spike protein, and its treated like any other antigen at that point. Collected and presented by dendritic cells to the immune system, it goes to the lymphnodes and antibody selection process begins. It gets super complicated at that point, but thats just because the immune system is complicated.

At the end, we have antibodies that are specific to the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2 without any infection.",lbrv3z,2021-02-03 17:47:58
"COVID-19 mRNA vaccines teach your body to make a harmless piece of the spike proteins and your immune system sees that the spike protein doesn’t belong there and this causes your body to start building an immune response and making antibodies. mRNA vaccines can generate a stronger immune response than older vaccines through stimulating the immune system to create both antibodies and immune system killer cells. That is, they help create two types of immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 and are completely safe, so there is no need to worry about them having a negative effect on the immune system.",lbrv3z,2021-02-03 19:25:19
"Measles infects cells in the immune system as a means of “offense is the best defense.”  

But once an mRNA vaccine has entered a cell, it’s stuck there.  It can’t reproduce and go on to infect other cells.  So a few immune cells will die, which happens all day every day, but there is t going to be any widespread processs to wipe out all of the memory cells.",lbrv3z,2021-02-03 21:03:45
"I'll quote the paragraph you refer to for other readers:

> While the concept seems simple, it required decades of work for mRNA vaccines to overcome a series of hurdles. First, scientists learned how to modify mRNA so that it did not produce violent immune system reactions. **Second, they learned how to encourage immune system cells to gobble up the mRNA as it passed by in the blood**. Third, they learned how to coax those cells to make large amounts of the critical piece of protein. Finally, they learned how to enclose the mRNA inside microscopically small capsules to protect it from being destroyed by chemicals in our blood.

The mRNA can enter any cell, after which the cell machinery (the ribosomes) reads it and starts producing spike proteins until the mRNA is broken down by enzymes in the cells (it doesn't last very long, maybe 10 hours or a day at most). The mRNA never becomes a permanent part of the cell and doesn't alter DNA either. A portion of the spike proteins is presented on the outside of the cell or secreted, where immune cells can encounter it.

The primary target of mRNA vaccines are certain immune cells called dendritic cells, because they are professional antigen presenting cells and play an important role in initiating an immune response. They are a kind of scavengers that try to find antigens (such as the spike protein) and bring it to immune cells called T-cells (a kind of white blood cell) and probably also B-cells. The T- and B-cells take over the immune response from there.

The measles virus damages the memory B-cells, that remember past infections and code for antibodies. But the mRNA can't replicate like the measles virus does; there will never be more mRNA vaccine in you body than the amount that is injected. Even if the mRNA manages to encounter and enter a memory B-cell, it's only few cells and not the large wipe that the measles virus is capable of.

"I think it might be difficult to compare for many vaccines. Take measles for example. In the Netherlands the measles vaccination became included in the national vaccination program in 1976. At that time 98% of children had had the disease when they reached the age of 10 years and 70% before they were 5 years old. At the start of the measles program it was deemed necessary only to vaccinate children that were about 2 years old. 
So they had a much smaller group to vaccinate to reach herd immunity, with a vaccine that was much less demanding when it comes to storage.

We still have the occasional measles outbreak in the Netherlands though, because some people don't vaccinate their kids (mostly in certain religious groups). The last large outbreak was 2013-2014. It was estimated that 30.000 people became infected. 180 children had to be hospitalized. Even with herd immunity you'll have outbreaks once in a while.",lae6cv,2021-02-08 11:40:20

They would wait for approvals, in this case they started manufacturing at scale as soon as they were reasonable sure they had  a safe and effective vaccine candidate. 

It can take years to enroll clinical trial participants in large enough numbers. Thousands of people were eager and willing to volunteer for these clinical trials it took less than two months to fill the slots. 

3) The clinical trial is looking for how effective a vaccine is compared the a placebo which means some number of people have to get infected with whatever they are vaccinated against to determine effectiveness. It takes a long time to time to get any results other than testing for antibodies in the blood and safety. Say a new measles vaccine is developed, the risk of picking up measles at the grocery store or at your family’s thanksgiving is nearly zero, compare that with the chance of picking up Covid which is much much higher. Most clinical trial participants were vaccinated in late summer or early fall when the virus started surging and people in the placebo groups started getting infected at a much higher rate than people in the vaccine group. I believe this happened even quicker than expected. By the time enough people were infected, Pfizer and Moderna had all of their other data and information ready to go, once they hit the threshold of infections they were ready to submit to the FDA pretty quickly. 


Finally not a comment on how fast it was done but just my experience of being a clinical trial participant. These trials aren’t run by some pharma CEO in a suit, they are run by doctors and nurses all over the world. There’s probably a group in your community that does it. I live a semi rural area and there are at lease 3 clinical trial sites in my region. The hundreds of doctors and nurses running these things want themselves and their families to be safely vaccinated too. They also get paid the same no matter what the outcome. There’s no incentive to cover up or hide anything, they’d be putting themselves and their loved ones at risk. They want a safe and effective vaccine just as much as the rest of us do so most of them are going to make sure everything is done right and above board. I was unblinded last week, it’s been 4 months since I was vaccinated. I am perfectly fine and have no long term side effects at all.",l7snu2,2021-01-29 15:35:47
"It's true the vaccines being produced against coronavirus were created in record time, but that's not because they were rushed. It's[ because of careful preparation. ](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/opinions/covid-vaccine-marathon-not-sprint-bloom/index.html)The technology that underlies both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has been in the works for more than a decade and was made precisely for a pandemic situation. The pandemic is an emergency situation which required emergency response but that does not mean the companies bypassed safety protocols or performed inadequate testing. In addition to the safety review by the FDA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization has convened a panel of vaccine safety experts to independently evaluate the safety data from the clinical trial. The safety of COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be closely monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA, so overall, you should definitely get the vaccine as soon as possible because it is SAFE and much more beneficial for your health.",l7snu2,2021-01-29 22:02:11

"I have to agree with what has been said. Getting the COVID vaccine is beneficial not only for yourself, but for everyone around you. I believe that getting vaccinated is a way for me to do my part in combating this pandemic. I also agree with what others have said about the procedure of making the vaccine. The vaccine was expedited, as is understandable given the circumstances, but it still went through all the necessary steps that any other vaccine goes through. The number of health care workers and individuals in science fields who have received the vaccine also speaks to its reliability. If they had doubts about the vaccine they wouldn't be getting it in the first place.",l7snu2,2021-01-30 00:00:23
"I agree. There is no way for companies to avoid the safety protocols or adequate testing. Plus, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has vaccine injury compensation programs so basically they are guaranteeing in a way that the vaccines are safe. A lot of government organizations are involved in making sure the vaccines are safe, including CDC, NIH, FDA, HRSA.

"I don’t know for certain about weed, however I suspect the strain plays a big part. For example, NSAIDs (Advil, Aleve, etc) and Antipyretics (Tylenol, acetaminophen) have been shown to reduce the body’s immune response. In short, when you take away the inflammation and fever, your body doesn’t fight as hard to create the antibodies.

If you’re partaking in a strain that targets inflammation, it could have a negative impact.  I also partake on a regular basis and I’ve backed off of weed for my vaccine. 

Hope this helps!

"I've been researching both the potential side effects and potential negative impact on the mRNA vaccine, as I'm a regular smoker now and I got Pfizer three days ago.  


I've found that cannabis impacts the immune system in a way that it acts as a regulator - it can boost it for people whose immune system is weak (autoimmune diseases, for example) or weaken it for healthy people. A friend of mine who is a doctor said that we should not consume anything that has a ""strong immune response"" after getting the vaccine. Does weed have that kind of immune response? The research shows it does trigger some sort of immune response, but can we say it's strong?  


I have no idea if my assumption is correct, if I understood the research well, or if what I read online is relevant and enough to be considered a fact, but I understood that smoking might have an effect on the vaccine efficacy, as both weed and vaccine influence the immune system. Would it, then, be helpful for some and damaging for some other people?   


I guess we need to wait for more research to be done on this particular topic, but if anyone is more competent, share your knowledge and wisdom.",l6urx4,2021-03-05 23:38:58
"My personal opinion is that you should get the vaccine if it's offered to you. You're right the system is broken (corrupt governments etc), but you won't fix the system by skipping the vaccine. You passing up the vaccine won't necessarily mean it goes to someone who needs it more-- most likely it'll go to someone else who is in your same position (a friend of a politician who doesn't need it the most). 

It would be great if everyone who is at highest risk was able to be first in line. That's how it *should* be. But a lot of countries (even wealthy ones) are doing a bad job actually getting the vaccine to those people. In the mean time, if you get the vaccine, you are still helping reduce the spread of COVID. It also means you're no longer in line-- you're one less person your country will need to vaccinate as more doses (hopefully) come in.

Again that's just my opinion. I understand the feeling, I'd have the same thoughts if I was offered a vaccine, but I personally would take it.",l6pqwi,2021-01-28 06:47:01
"Yes. The system sucks and it’s wrong but it’s not your doing and skipping the vaccine isn’t going to give it to someone else who should be getting it before you.

"The AZ vaccine is 70% effective at preventing symptomatic cases, but it has also been 100% effective against severe COVID, which I believe was one of the primary objectives in creating the vaccine. Basically, if the vaccine is keeping people out of the hospital, it’s doing its job.

So he patted my arm and stretched the skin a few times and patted it some more. I thought it was so weird. Then he gave me the shot and I didn't even feel it. I can't tell if the needle was really that much smaller than the flu shot, or if his technique was THAT AWESOME. Maybe you could ask for something similar? Good luck!!!",l5q3sh,2021-01-26 23:16:00

It's been strange that the EU has taken such a hostile ""fulfill your obligations or we'll fuck you over"" tone over this, which is what's made me wonder if they've basically decided to ""bump"" the EU on the delivery schedule because another bloc offered to pay more, or something along those lines - that just seems to be the kind of language officials are using, not so much implying an *accident* but an active decision to renege on a commitment.

"Anyone can make these reports - in fact, most of these people probably died from other conditions or being old, but they received the vaccine within a recent period.

"Since the CDC is estimating that about 20M doses have been administered. So you f my math is correct that’s a rate of 0.0008% death per dose admin. That’s pretty low. 
That’s also a low rate of adverse events (35k/20M)
Which sucks if you are the family of the person who dies 
And while it may sound harsh  the benefits of an effective vaccine right now outweigh the risks because the rates are low. And because the rate is never going to be zero. 
But I’m sure a lot of people are looking at this data and if it was worrisome there would be pauses. For instance California just paused using a particular lot due to adverse events, it was investigated and vaccination resumed. I don’t know what they found ( only saw it in the crawl ) but a concern was raised, it was addressed that’s what the Health department do .",l40rml,2021-01-25 00:22:14

The lipids packing it in (in the vaccine) are just lipids, also a requirement for life as our cell membranes and organelles are made up of a lipid double layer. mRNA vaccines are not experimental anymore, and are an amazing technology in my opinion. Our bodies are just a collection of chemicals interacting with each other, so I don’t understand the fear of chemicals (not assuming you fear it, I just mean in general from what I have heard). Yes of course we won’t know if there are any negative long term effects until years have gone by (in the meantime the virus will continue to rage) and we don’t know the full scope of negative long term effects of the virus either, but we do know that a lot of people still haven’t recovered their health many months after ridding themselves of the virus so in my opinion the virus is much more scary. There are also much fewer antigens in the vaccine than there are in the virus so logic would dictate that there are less possibilities for any autoimmune issues from the vaccine than the virus. Even if the the death tolls were a bit inflated, it wouldn’t be by a lot and there can be no doubt about the excess mortality rate. Another point is that the health care system can’t handle it when there are too many infected due to them being very sick and taking a long time to recover, which negatively affects all other aspects of health care (surgery, cancer treatment etc). 

Edit: would to wouldn’t
Edit2: 
But yes it’s isn’t a traditional vaccine, which may give some people pause, but that’s how progress works, everything is new at some point :) and it wouldn’t be approved unless the benefits greatly outweighed the risks.",l40rml,2021-01-24 17:15:15
"We would only count someone as a COVID-related death if they had a positive test, or had all the classic symptoms of COVID (but there may not have been supplies or time to test).

What you may be thinking of is the fact that sometimes people come in having a heart attack (and die), and are found to also have COVID. We do consider that a COVID-related death because even though their cause of death wasn't primarily from COVID, the virus likely caused them to have a heart attack, and thus it was still related.",l40rml,2021-01-24 19:10:11
[removed],l40rml,2021-01-24 17:35:16
"No problem :) no one in the placebo group that contracted COVID in the trials died so they can’t say definitively if they save lives from those, as there is nothing to compare the vaccine group to. They only show that the vaccines are up to 95% effective in preventing a disease that is known to be deadly. Some questions, like the ones you mention can’t be answered definitively ahead of time, that’s just reality. There are encouraging data from animal studies regarding transmission though (transmission is not a yes or no question, but to what degree the vaccines will reduce, not completely eliminate, transmission), but we’ll have to wait and see how much the vaccines reduce transmission. Even if they don’t reduce it a lot, they do reduce the disease a lot. We should soon be getting data from Israel as they are ahead in vaccination coverage. Anyway, vaccines are not a magic solution but they can be incredible tools in the battle against this virus. Thanks for the chat and good luck following the data :)

Edit: oh, and I looked up “gung ho” and I must object to being unthinkly eager, I think a lot! ;) we just seem to have come to different conclusions so far.",l40rml,2021-01-24 18:08:43
"Well in any case i didn’t mean it in its literal definition.  Just a figure of speech. As far as vaccines not being a magic tool, we are 100% in agreement, and is the only reason I feel the need to play devils advocate here. We should very much have these questions on the fore front of our minds, until we get the data to provide answers for us. Also, we should be just as transparent when talking about other possible solutions, but I realize this is a vaccine forum, so I won’t go there. I’d say we’re closer to the same sides then it seems, but I’d like to see the data back up the claims for me to be certain about its efficacy. Like you said, it’s a wait and see operation.",l40rml,2021-01-24 18:19:20
"Thanks (gung ho thing) :) 
Yup, these are very important questions, and I am looking forward to knowing more. Good that we are closer than I might have thought. 
For my part, the documented 95% efficacy in preventing disease in clinical trials, along with them looking very safe so far, is all the claims and proof I need at this point. So far the demand is higher than the supply, so vaccine resistance may not be a big problem yet, but I hope enough people will get vaccinated so we can get those definitive answers.",l40rml,2021-01-24 18:42:23

>Accelerated approval, on the other hand, is based on adequate and well‐controlled clinical trials establishing that the vaccine has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) considers the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response an acceptable surrogate marker that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit of inactivated influenza vaccines.3 Approval under this pathway is subject to the post‐marketing requirement that the sponsor conduct adequate and well‐controlled clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit of the vaccine, that is, protection from influenza disease. Because influenza is a serious and sometimes life‐threatening illness, FDA has interpreted the accelerated approval regulation as allowing accelerated approval of an inactivated influenza vaccine when the supply of influenza vaccine is insufficient to immunize all persons recommended for annual influenza vaccination by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The accelerated approval regulatory mechanism was used to license the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines Fluarix® (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) in 2005, FluLaval® (ID Biomedical Corporation of Quebec) in 2006, Afluria® (bioCSL) in 2007, Agriflu® in 2009 (Novartis), and Fluad® in 2015 (Novartis). At the present time, confirmatory studies have verified the clinical benefit for Fluarix®, FluLaval®, Afluria®, and Agriflu®.


This is also very helpful to understand how the Covid vaccines were released this fast.",l3g4n0,2021-01-23 18:40:47
"From my understanding flu vaccines are based off the strains of the most common strains from the last year. So 2021 flu vaccine will be based off the most common strains of this year. 

Flu vaccine isn't all inclusive, it is in the upper 40-60% effective because it doesn't cover every strain of flu just the most common.

The live vaccines often contain a weakened varient of the virus. This makes sure that the person getting the vaccine doesn't become ill themselves while allowing for their immune system to remember the virus,kzv5wn,2021-01-18 15:04:38
"Live vaccines are typically referred to as ""live attenuated vaccines"", and it's the attenuation part that makes those vaccines safe for use.

The virus will have been weakened to the point that the individual cannot become sick and therefore transmit the virus, but the body still starts to fight the virus as if it were causing infection. A week or two later, the body has developed the antibodies and immune memory to fight the same virus in the future, if it were to return in a non-attenuated state.

Some vaccines have been developed in this way by putting the infectious pathogen in eggs, then inserting the ""offspring"" of that virus into more eggs, and so on. Several eggs down the chain the virus is weakened, and therefore ready to be used in a live attenuated vaccine.",kzv5wn,2021-01-18 15:26:19
"The virus is weakened enough that most people will be fine if they are around you while you’re shedding it. That said, people who have compromised immune systems can get sick from someone vaccinated recently with a weakened live virus. When my mother in law was going through chemo, our pediatrician would ask us, “Are you seeing Grandma in the next two weeks? Ok, make an appointment to come back for this one. The others are fine to do now.”",kzv5wn,2021-01-18 16:53:08
"Why am I getting down voted for wanting to become more knowledgeable about vaccinations?!? Shit, sorry!",kzv5wn,2021-01-18 16:40:18
"Because they're injected in the body and they don't reach any excretory path like the nose or mouth or anus, to become contagious to others.

Oral vaccines could shed, but they would only give mild symptoms in case of an infection.",kzv5wn,2021-01-18 17:03:18

"Both Pfizer and Moderna say that their vaccines are about 95% effective at preventing people from getting sick with Covid symptoms, but there is not enough evidence yet on whether the vaccines also prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.

The research is ongoing, but since there is no definite answer it is important that everyone continues to wear masks and practice social distancing until the country gets closer to herd immunity.",kyuyjm,2021-01-17 01:15:41
How exactly would they be able to test transmission?,kyuyjm,2021-01-17 01:24:20
"They have been saying this for months.  I am troubled that no scholar has answered this yet, at least preliminarily. Pretty important detail.",kyuyjm,2021-01-25 18:31:17
Based on what you're saying shouldn't that maintain its optional rather than mandatory status? And wouldn't this make passport/travel certificates useless? Or atleast not as useful as previously intended?,kyuyjm,2021-01-28 03:30:23
"To test transmission it seems that studies would need to look deeper into how the vaccine works in the body, such as whether it prevents an individual from getting infected altogether, or whether it simply stops a person from becoming sick. With the latter, this could mean that the virus continues to replicate in the nose and throat, and would still be able to spread from a vaccinated person to someone who has not yet received the vaccine, but there is still not enough evidence to make valid conclusions.",kyuyjm,2021-01-19 01:12:58
"Heyo! Vaccine developer here. I work on the development side, rather than the clinical, but I have learned some things.

Adjuvants: These are additives to the vaccine itself that signal the immune system to come check out the vaccine. These can hurt depending on the type. There are many types. The pain is not a cause for concern, just not pleasant.

Carrier molecules: The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use mRNA technology, which needs to be delivered to the inside of your cells in order to be processed by your cellular machinery (your body actually generates the vaccine; the mRNA is basically a precursor). These vaccines use lipids for delivery, but intramuscular injection of them hurts! Lipids are fats and oils and are not a cause for alarm, except at high concentrations when toxicity effects can start to emerge. The dose was optimized in clinical trials.

Salt content: I'm not sure how common high sodium chloride concentrations are in vaccines on the market, but if high, it can cause discomfort due to osmotic pressure changes in your cells around the injection site. Sodium chloride is just table salt, very safe except in very large quantities.

And basically that's it. Most of the time the adjuvants hurt because they're irritant compounds and because they need to hurt so thr lymphocytes would go to the site of the injection. So a painful site would trigger a bigger immune response and a higher antibody count.",kyo15e,2021-01-16 23:20:54

  I'm an at risk (immune compromised) front line worker who would have been still waiting.

"Nurses have told me the following over the years. Can you debunk any of these? 

1-the temperature of the vaccine when it’s administered can impact pain, colder stings more.
2- relax the muscle the needle goes into while the shot is given and you will be less sore the following days
3- exercising the muscle after getting a shot helps “disperse medication” and will lessen soreness the next day",kyo15e,2021-01-17 16:28:29

The Covid thing is silly if you are going with the Moderna or Pfizer types. They are acellular. Only if you are dealing with an adenoviral vector type as in Astra Zenica or J&J is there an issue from a staunch “evil” standpoint. Ad vectors are grown in 293 cells.

"I’m on the phase 3 trial on it. & know of 2 others as well. None of us (ages 23 and 2 60+) have had any noticeable side effects. Although it is a blind study so the possibility does exist that none (lol) of the 3 of us got the actual vaccine but instead got the saline shot. I was told at my blood draw #2 this month that we should expect to be unblinded from the study by mid Feb or by end of Feb as Janssen/ Johnson’s & Johnson will have enough data from US phase 3 to apply for US EUA. I go in for my next draw mid Feb. The vibe I’ve gotten is that the side effects on Janssen get less or zero the older you are which is kinda the opposite of the mRNAs. 

FWIW My hubs is on the Pfizer trial and got his shots in Aug & September and he had no side effects after shot #1 but did have clear and obvious side effects for 2.5 days after shot #2. His study was unblinded this month and it was confirmed that he did get the real vaccine.... which we already suspected was the case due to his side effects.

I’m really hoping that Janssen J&J will get EUA as its a single shot and does not require neither the sub cold storage systems & tempering up of the mRNA ones.

"Thank you so much for sharing your experience!! I have been wondering about the short term symptoms following the vaccine. The body ache and fever are the symptoms of your body’s immune response, ramping up those antibodies to fight when and if they are needed.

I think we’ve all turned to Dr. Google at times and he always gives the worst prognosis. 

Thank you for getting your vaccine and helping to mitigate Covid for everyone. Take care and be well.",kx1qm3,2021-01-14 18:47:41
"Are you sure about these symptoms? Like they must be from the vaccine? You didn't get a common cold etc.. . Because from what I know the pfizer vaccine shouldn't have any symptoms on the body since it even doesn't even include a weaker version of the virus!

I think it might because of your health/lifestyle prior to the vaccine. correct me If I am wrong.

Good luck!",kx1qm3,2021-01-17 13:43:47

"Thankfully a raging temperature doesn’t instantly mean death and my partner was on standby to ring 111/take me to A&E if the paracetamol didn’t work (I must add, I didnt feel a gradual temperature happening, I went from feeling nauseous at 6pm to burning up at 8-9pm). If on my second dose the same happens, I wouldn’t hesitate to ring 111/attend A&E but hindsight is a wonderful thing. Paracetamol did bring it down gradually and the difference between 42-43 degrees and under 40 was night and day, I INSTANTLY felt better, not well but massively better.

"So, in theory, you can get the vaccine as soon as you're not experiencing any symptoms anymore. 

But as a general rule, all the family medical doctors I talked to, recommend to wait for a month after the positive test.

So as soon as you're not having any symptoms anymore and it's been a month since the test/first symptoms, you're good to go.",kwvx4w,2021-01-14 08:37:25
"Yes, you should definitely get the vaccine. Vaccines interact with the immune system to produce an immune response like that produced by the natural infection, but they do not cause the disease or put the immunized person at risk of its potential complications. Covid-19 vaccines have predictably prevented illness, and experts say that they are a far safer bet than the reactions that occur after contracting the virus.

Vaccines for some pathogens, like pneumococcal bacteria, induce better immunity than the natural infection does and early evidence suggests that the Covid-19 vaccines may fall into this category. Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies — one marker of immune response — in their blood than did people who had been sick with Covid-19 which shows that the vaccine is much safer and will protect you for longer than the naturally occurring antibodies after being infected.",kwvx4w,2021-01-16 18:56:11
"I've recovered from COVID, too. They're recommending survivors get it, so I plan to get it as soon as it's available to me because A) I hate being sick, B) for all I know it might not play out the same way each time, C) they say vaccinated people can still spread it but they might find evidence to the contrary so getting vaccinated can potentially help stop the spread to people it could kill, and D) it'll add one more to the statistics showing safety to convince people it won't turn them into a werewolf or something.",kwvx4w,2021-01-17 02:45:16

"I’m an ER nurse and for me it was not a difficult decision. This is the safest vaccine ever produced, from a manufacturing standpoint. No fetal cell lines used. No live or dead virus particles. Just a tiny piece of a molecule off of a protein off of the virus. It is injected into your body and your body recognizes it as foreign. That is why some people get some side effects like a sore arm or body aches. That’s your immune system doing it’s job and recognizing the foreign invader. Because then the next time your immune system encounters it, when you are exposed to actual COVID-19, it launches a full response with a 95% success rate. The only vaccine more successful than that is the MMR. In comparison, the annual flu vaccine is only about 40-60% effective. And with it being 95% effective, if you are part of the 5% who still get COVID-19, you will get a much lesser form of the disease. This disease is no joke. I am seeing it take down completely healthy people. People who maybe don’t die but months later still have ongoing lung and breathing issues. So that is why it’s a no-brainer for me.

It’s ok to be nervous, but the CDC and WHO have amazing, scientifically supported information and both Pfizer and Moderna offer FAQs and available research in regards to their formulas. 
As a teacher, you are a brave frontline worker who needs to protect themselves in order to continue to serve your community.

It has been rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it was approved for use, and scientists are also constantly monitoring information from several sources for any sign that the vaccine may cause an adverse event. In terms of side-effects, the reactions are usually minor and temporary, and commonly include a sore arm or mild fever, but the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the risks and provide safety for you, your students, and their families.

At the end of the day, I think I made the right choice, but I’m still nervous.  The side effects have been pretty rough so far.

Look at the numbers. Look at how few people out of millions have been hurt by the vaccine vs. the millions who have died or had their lives ruined by the virus. The numbers show that objectively we should fear the virus much more than the vaccine.

Read the list of ingredients and google all their other medicinal and culinary uses. Can you list a concrete reason to fear any of them more than the virus?

Listen to your Reason, not misguided Fear. Direct your Fear to the right enemy and get your armor to protect you from it. Going into battle is scary, but it's better than waiting for the enemy to slaughter you.

"HPV is approved up to age 45 now.  The [US CDC schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html#table-age) lists HPV as ""recommended vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making"".  Before 2018 the vaccine wasn't approved for those over 26 in the US because the assumption was that most people by that age had already been exposed to multiple strains of HPV and for most people there would be very little benefit for the vaccine.  Newer research has found the HPV is linked to many other types of oral and head cancers and that even if you were exposed to some strains there may still be a significant benefit to reduce your risk of getting other strains that cause cancer.

I would recommend double checking on insurance coverage if you haven't already done so given the way the CDC recommendation is worded an insurance company could refuse to cover it if isn't recommended by your physician.  Without insurance a HPV vaccine would usually be over $200 per dose.

"Two reasons.  First, Merck has a monopoly for HPV vaccines in the US market.  GlaxoSmithKline used to sell their own HPV vaccine, Cervarix, in the US but they stopped selling because the sales were very poor.  I am having trouble finding a citation but if I recall correctly it was less than 10%.  They struggled because Merck was first to the market and the original version of Gardasil cover 4 strains whereas Cervarix only protected against 2.  When Merck released Gardasil 9, which protects against 9 strains, it became even harder to market Cervarix and it was withdrawn from the US market.

The second problem is that they have had a much smaller market of customers than most vaccines.  The original approval was only for girls and they capped the maximum age at 26.  Many conservative parents were also reluctant to get the vaccine for their daughters because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease and they felt that it encouraged promiscuity.  This really slowed down adoption in their original target audience.  This forced Merck to charge a higher price to recover their development costs.

Merck has definitely done well financially on Gardasil but the puritanical views many people have on sexuality have really made this a much less successful vaccine that it could have been.",kvflb1,2021-01-14 05:53:57

The same podcast has more episodes on the vaccine development going back several months, reoccurring with each major milestone.",ku3k8v,2021-01-10 03:42:53
"You could probably find information on science news sites :)
I'm not sure about the American vaccine rollout. I know it's got some issues with distribution (needing to stay frozen etc) but that's it.
Even CDC might have some useful news for you",ku3k8v,2021-01-10 01:11:08
"Both Washington Post & NYT are providing access to Covid articles WITHOUT A PAYWALL. So you can read lots of articles on vaccine rollout status. 

On the 75% vaccinated figure, if your thinking US is going to get at 75% of total population done, not happening imo. The goal is kinda to get 75% of the at risk groups vaccinated by early 2021. This would be those in 75+, HCW (health care workers / employees), those living in congregate facilities (nursing homes, prisons) and the staff working directly with that population; then those immunocompromised from all age groups and those over 65. Maybe workers in high employee density indoor jobs like meat & poultry processing plants. Then teachers, front line grocery & necessary goods employees. 75% from all those groups would be a pretty hefty herd immunity for limiting outbreaks in 2022/2023 if everyone who gets it this year gets the next years vaccine as well. Similar to annual flu shot. If there are still quantities of vaccines left then it will go to general population over 16/18. 

Right now 2 vaccines have emergency approval- Pfizer & Moderna. Both use mRNA research for thier vaccine and both require superspecialized transport and handling and both are 2 shots within under 30 days. Where I am - New Orleans - it’s the big health science centers / teaching hospitals which are getting the vaccines as they have the staffing and equipment to do what’s needed for sub cold temp. (My husband is in the 2 yr  Pfizer trial and he got his shots in Aug & Sept and was told this week that he did get the real vaccine). So if your a patient of a MD affiliated with the health science center set up to get vaccines & you are in a risk category,  you’ve should have gotten an email or can call your MD to schedule your first shot. The supply is limited but should be better by Feb & March. For some areas is local health departments that are doing the vaccine rollout. Nothing unfortunately is at all centralized so far for any of this in the US. Hopefully Biden administration will be much more proactive in planning and organization. 

There are 2 other vaccines finishing up thier trials: Astra-Zeneca (aka the Oxford) and Janssen/ Johnson & Johnson (aka the Ensemble). Both of those DO NOT need the super cold of the mRNA platform vaccines. They use standard medical office refrigeration storage and are shelf stable. Janssen is a single shot. I’m not sure on the Oxford. If either of these get approval in the US, imho it will change the pace of vaccination everywhere to reach 75% at risk late spring as it will be like doing flu shots. ((I’m in the Janssen phase 3 trial and supposedly we should know by end of Feb what’s what as the phase 3 trials completed worldwide the week of Christmas))

Again if Astra or Janssen get approval in the US, there will be lots of vaccines this spring globally (there’s at least 4 other emergency approved vaccines in other parts of the world). So Covid # should decrease or if you do get it will be milder with less hospitalization. 

On the delays...... Operation Warp speed didn’t let vaccine research contracts out till June and then OWS had to order vaccines last summer from the drug co. (doing research to find a vaccine, whether they were in OWS or independently). In the US, the federal govt did NOT order the initial maximum that Pfizer had potentially set aside for US (Pfizer’s global with big R&D hubs in Belgium & Germany) so when US finally ordered additional in Dec from Pfizer., it moved that delivery cycle to late spring or this summer as opposed to now. Trials in the US started in August, other countries started trials in May & June. 

Just as a note, Canada ordered from several drug companies (Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sino, Janssen) and ordered more than their population. They hedged their bets that maybe 1 or 2 of the new drug research would not pan out or might hit delays. So they had back up. 

All the Covid vaccines are new. Developed in response to Covid. There isn’t old vaccines just sitting on a shelf in a vial that can be used. 
That drug companies could get vaccines done & in arms for trials this summer is jump to hyper space fast. There’s hasn’t been delays on research or manufacturing. It’s quite the opposite and it’s amazing. Pfizer was already doing mRNA research in partnership conjunction with BNT Germany as was Moderna with the NIH which is the partner for Moderna in the US. For Janssen, their vaccine is based on the AdVac platforms they were already using for research on other Corona viruses- like SARS & MERS - and their just approved in 2019 Ebola vaccine. It’s kinda a golden age for Virus hunters. Things are going very fast considering outbreak started a yr ago.

Get your flu shot, wear a mask, was your hands and if you need to socialize do it outdoors. You’ll get your shot eventually. It will be ok.",ku3k8v,2021-01-10 13:37:42

"On getting paid for Covid trials, it depends on which trial, what trial phase (1,2,3) & what country you are in. I’m on the Janssen/ Johnson & Johnson phase 3 trial, a single shot, which in the US rolled out in Dec and was filled (60k globally) Christmas week. I got paid $50 for the 1st lengthy in person visit at the study center (mine is at research center at a big teaching hospital with a medical school) and then $50 for the 2 visits so far with a blood draw, which are 6 over a 2 yr period. Not everyone who signs up gets into the trial, the health history is pretty deep, I imagine some folks don’t meet the study criteria. I do on line reporting twice a week via IQVA study hub (it sucks as an App) and this part is NOT compensated. My husband is on the Pfizer trial; he got his first shot in Aug and 2nd in Sept. He too got $50 for his intake first visit and then $50 for his 2 with a blood draw BUT he gets a whopping $ 5.00 / five dollars each time he completes his on line reporting to the study center that’s the partner institution for Pfizer trial in our area. We both get the $ via a debit card and you fill out a W-9 & I-9. For both of us, that first visit was about 3+ hours long and they do a nasal swabs and we got the quick test (antigen) and the (sent off 2 a lab) PCR test. You aren’t doing it for the $.

Both are 2 yr trials. And both of the ones we were on are blinded studies, so you get a shot but do NOT know if you got the actual vaccine or the saline placebo shot. Now that Pfizer has gotten Emergency Use Authorization, that study has been unblinded, Hubs got a call that he did get the real vaccine and he is getting mailed a card that shows he is fully COVID-19 vaccinated. (He had pretty distinctive side effects after his 2nd shot, so we expected that he got the real stuff). Mine is still blinded, & supposedly by end of Feb Janssen should have the data to see if it too gets EUA. If it does and I got the saline shot, then I get the real vaccine. If it doesn’t get EUA then I’m supposed to get prioritized to get whatever approved vaccine the medical school has. 

As they are 2 yr trials, we are kinda expected to (but not required to) keep up with reporting & blood draws as needed for the full 2 years and we’ll probably also be getting Covid vaccination shots at our anniversary month next year. 

If your area has a teaching hospital or has a big Health Science Center, these have a research dept which does drug studies, either at the research institute or with select doctors offices.",ksrqb7,2021-01-12 11:22:07

"DLRgrrrl, Make sure you write down all the oddities you’ve felt and report it to the study center. Whether it’s on line or you / your mom calls as your a minor. If you have a red area, take a foto. Did they give you the red mark card? It’s like an index card with a bullseye on it, if so and you have a mark or rash, use the bullseye card to determine size / diameter & color. 

When my hubs got Pfizer shot #1, nothing. but shot #2 had ahem “distinctive” side effects, like shot on Wednesday AM & all ok, we even went to Costco. 😎Felt tired late Wed nite slight fever @ 99. Thurs / Fri fever 99-100.3, body aches, diarrhea and this odd feeling in his lower legs & feet like painful as if it was puffy swollen to walk but there was no actual puffiness there. He took to bed watching TV no appetite. Then it was all over by Saturday early. He reported it online Thursday pm and one of the study RNs called back like immediately and then checked in on Fri & Sat & Sun AM & PM. It’s mucho importante to tell study center if anything happening and how long. We have Oximeter and Blood pressure cuff (we’re not young, our kid is 23) and everything was ok for hubs spot O2 and BP. If your having side effects, then you probably got the good juice so lucky you & your family. Anecdotally the mRNAs seem to have some side effects after shot #2 for adults, usually just a low fever for a day. 

Btw the Janssen trial I’m on (not mRNA based but AdneoVac “platform”)seems to have little to no side effects the older you are. The side effects are mainly seem to be seen in the 18-30 yr old group. It’s not a mRNA vaccine. The only thing I had was some light sensitivity & flush rash at shot site that afternoon which could or could not mean I got the real stuff.",ksrqb7,2021-01-12 15:00:54

"If you are enrolled in a trial 2 things were done, you put the App on your phone & signed onto it at your first visit OR got an email with info and your link in the email for the weekly reporting site and you opened the email at yoir first visit.

you were given an Emergency Patient Contact card (my Hubs one for Pfizer was heavy paper and slightly smaller than a credit card) that has your patient ID #, the Study #, the Compound info and the 24 hr toll  free # plus contact info on the Principal Investigator for the study site your at. Your info is unique. 
You have it somewhere. Perhaps it’s in the ziploc bag that had your swabs and test tubes? 

The side effects maybe are 2 -3 days. My hubs side effects were not a picnic, but totally gone in 2.5 days as if nothing had happened. It’s a sign that you got the real vaccine and your body is building up antibodies to Covid. It is NOT Covid. None of the vaccines have the virus. Don’t worry about that, you were not given Covid. But what it does have is a spike that looks almost just like a Covid spike; your body senses the spike is an invader and says basically says “WTF let this little POS in” and starts to battle the invading POS spike; and by fighting it creates antibodies to fight any other spikes that are actually Covid that you might get exposed to in a few weeks or months from now.

"Good evening. Generally speaking these vaccines are licensed to be administered via intramuscular (in the muscle) route. 
Best practice for skinnier people would mean going for the muscle bulk of the tricep to ensure its not administered subcutaneously (into the skin).

For the latter case, where they keep them separate in case one/two/three are needed at a time, it may even come down to fridge space: if you know you're going to need to use the one-offs regularly, and you know two-four of them combined will be often needed, can enough distribution points store the individual AND the combined?

"DTaP is Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis (whooping cough). 

HiB is *Haemophilus influenzae* type B, a bacteria that often causes meningitis and pneumonia. 

PCV is Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which protects against the bacterium *Streptococcus* *pneumoniae* (another bacteria which can cause meningitis and pneumonia, among other things). 

IPV is Inactivated Polio, which protects against polio (and is the version that doesn't use live virus).

Rota is the Rotavirus vaccine; Rotavirus causes a lot of what people call ""stomach flu""; this would be the oral one.",krws09,2021-01-07 04:51:46

I know there is also some issue with combos and the schedule and making sure you hit the right dates and time points but I know very little details

"First of all, when you go in, they'll ask if you're allergic to anything (i.e. eggs) or have any preexisting conditions relevant to the specific vaccine to make sure it's safe for you.

My 3 sibs and I got every childhood vaccine growing up (except chickenpox - by the time that one came out, we were naturally immune). I can't remember the exact age, but when we became teenagers, Mom let us decide if we wanted to get the flu vaccine every year. I've gotten the flu shot literally every year of my adult life, as has my youngest sister. I don't know how consistent the other 2 are every year, but I know they've gotten it multiple times. My elderly uncle and grandfather get their flu shot every year. My mom got her flu shot every year she was alive. My antivax dad claims thay gives you the flu. I have NEVER had the flu, not even a mild case.

Nobody in my family has EVER had ANY of the standard vaccine side-effects you read about. I feel a pinch when the needle goes in, and that's it. I've never had a sore arm, fever, aches or pains, headache, nothing. I grew up thinking vaccine ""side effects"" were EXTREMELY rare and they only had to list them because 1 person had that happen once. I now know it's not quite that extreme, but I can tell you truthfully they don't even happen to everyone. Every body is different. Every combo of genes is different (okay, except for identical twins).

However, this year, I browbeat my high risk category best friend (paralyzed from the chest down by a spinal cord injury, and thus immunocompromised) into getting his first flu shot in decades because you can't take any chances with your immune system this year. He had zero side effects, too, so it's not just my family.

Kudos to you for seeing the light. Viruses are the enemy, and vaccines are what your immune system uses to make its weapons and armor.

In the Middle Ages, people blamed fairies kidnapping their children and leaving behind ""changeling"" duplicates for their children being abnormal (now suspected to be autism). Now, they blame vaccines. Because acknowledging the truth that autism is mostly genetic (but not entirely, like Bending on Avatar) means there's nothing you can do about it. It *is* bull. Completely.

You'll be instinctively nervous because it's a new experience for you, and humans instinctively fear what is new. That's okay - the rational part of your mind that prompted you to get them is currently winning. Once you're done, spread the word and let skeptics know the vaccines didn't turn you into a werewolf. Congratulations on choosing to fight your anxiety for your health. We're rooting for you!",krbn1i,2021-01-09 05:44:23
"The good news is that you're never too old to get vaccinated!

As others have mentioned, you may experience some mild side effects like soreness at the injection sight or a low grade fever, but reactions are usually temporary and very mild.

" There are many strains of the flu virus, and those circulating change each year. While you may have had the flu in the past, your immune system may not have yet confronted the version of the virus that may lead to infection this year.

"Please don't. If you get your father vaccinated twice, that is denying someone else's father to get vaccinated at all. I understand the concern. But don't be selfish. 

Maybe get his antibody levels tested for reassurance and definitely wait until everyone else has had a chance to get the vaccine before doubling up. There are many of us that are still on strict lock down and barely getting through each day as we pray that our high-risk loved ones can get the shot before catching the disease that would probably kill them.",krl2to,2021-01-06 15:15:59
I don't live in the US or Europe. My country has a priority for elderly people to get the Pfizer vaccine currently. Anyone can get it. These is no shortage of restrictions.,krl2to,2021-01-06 17:23:57
"First off, many kudos to you for sharing! I’m sure your message and this thread will help many others. 

I totally agree with the advice given that if you convince yourself that your life (and frankly the lives of many others around you) depends on you getting the shots, you may feel a lot more compelled to go through with it. 

To calm your nerves, how about taking your headphones and listening to some music if they will allow you or watching a funny YouTube video before the nurse comes in. Don’t look at her needle, close your eyes, and count numbers backwards (it requires the mind to focus on something else while the nurse gives you the shot). When I got my HPV shot, that’s what I did and it took a quick jab and was done really quick, may be a few seconds at most. 

Few seconds of anxiety but a lifetime of protection! 

I wish you all the best, and I hope others can give you more creative ideas than mine :-).",kr8tu2,2021-01-06 01:10:27

"I was the same way for years then someone bluntly said (about the flu shot) ""Someone's grandma is going to die because you're too much of a fucking pussy to get a shot"".

It worked. I felt guilty thinking about it and finally sucked it up and got my flu shot. And then all of my other shots. I'm still terrified of needles but now I'm even part of the AZ vaccine study because I knew they needed people and I thought it was important to help.

Looking away makes it better. Focusing on something in the room helps a lot (they REALLY messed up the pain there, that's a shitty weld, why is one of the hinges on the door upside down compared to the other 2). Pinching myself as I know it's going to happen helps. Standing up afterwards and drinking some water helps me reset afterwards but I know for some people that's risky as they might faint so careful with that one.

The biggest thing is exposure. Now that I'm around needles more regularly it's not AS big of a deal but it still really freaks me out.",kr8tu2,2021-01-06 17:38:10
"One, tell the nurses you’re afraid. They will then send in the most skilled nurse to stick you.

Two, talk like your life depends on it. If your brain is fully occupied, you are less likely to focus on the needles.

Three, wiggle your toes. The muscle movement will distract from the feeling in you arm.

Finally, don’t even look at it.

Or you could always do what I did. Go get a clinical tech certification where you have to learn to draw blood and have blood drawn from you . I can stare needles down as I get jabbed for weekly allergy shots now when ten years ago I would have allowed myself to suffer.",kr8tu2,2021-01-05 22:29:50
"I think getting a vaccine injection is much easier than getting blood drawn so if you did that you should be able to get through it. The vaccine needle is smaller, doesn't hurt as much, your comfort doesn't depend as much on the skill of the technician, and it literally takes 2 seconds. To build courage don't think about the actual injection, think about the immunity you will gain. Each vaccine is like gaining a superpower against disease.",kr8tu2,2021-01-06 02:03:11

Most commercial/clinical antibody tests detect anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgM/IgG.  The vaccines and candidates currently approved or nearing approval only express spike (S).  So you will not get anti-N antibodies from the vaccine.,kqztxe,2021-01-05 15:07:24

Anti-N is a marker of prior infection.  So that person may have been exposed.  If it was just IgG then it probably wasn’t from the vaccine because at 17 days out I’d still expect you to have some anti-Spike IgM.,kqztxe,2021-01-05 15:31:44
"I don't think that it is very likely in the near future.  Part of the challenge is that MenB is relatively [rare](https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/surveillance/index.html#trends).  Even in the peak age group, <1, incidence is ~1 in 100K.  In the teenage/early 20s where they have targeted their efforts is closer to 1 in a million.  The majority of those cases tend to be on college campuses or other close living situations(e.g. army barracks).  For people that aren't in a high risk group the incidence is significantly lower.

The challenge of getting a wider approval is that MenB is so rare in the general population the relatively rare risk of a serious adverse reaction is close to the chances of actually benefiting from the vaccine.  I could see the CDC changing its recommendation if MenB becomes more common.",kr29yn,2021-01-05 22:39:08
Thank you this is interesting info! On another note If this isn’t it what do you think the next vaccine added to the schedule would be?,kr29yn,2021-01-05 22:50:45
"The next vaccine added to the schedule would be heavily dependent upon the success of various trials for vaccines in development.  As you are aware many vaccines that get developed never get approved for.   I think in the near future you are more likely to see improvements on existing vaccines rather than vaccines for new diseases.  There is a lot research into producing a better flu vaccines.  There is some trials testing new vaccines that protect against more strains of HPV and [pneumococcal](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1045/5876773).

There is research into vaccines against [Hepatitis C](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2020/20200415-zhu-hcv-.html), [norovirus](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01383/full), HIV, and [Gonorrhea](http://outbreaknewstoday.com/first-prophylactic-gonorrhea-vaccine-developed-65210/).

If in the placebo group, a vaccination is given. It will be nice to be finally sure about all that. I will be remaining in the study for the duration regardless of what group I am in.",kqlbzm,2021-01-08 12:42:04
"I hope we hear about the unblinding very soon. Various rumors indicate notification this week, but I guess we'll see.

I would like to know pretty quick, as my employer (a hospital)  is nudging us to get the vaccination which is now available to us at work.",kqlbzm,2021-01-05 13:35:01
"As an FYI, My hubs is on the Pfizer trial, his 1st shot was in August. He got an email week ago that the study would be unblinded at his next visit (first week of Feb) but he needed to reply to the email that he wanted to be unblinded. He replied “Yes”. He got a call yesterday from the study center that he did receive the actual vaccines and a reminder that they still wanted him to do the Feb followup visit. (Yeah we opened a bottle of Kirkland Prosecco)This is in New Orleans and the partner institution is Oschner. 
I’m on the Janssen J&J trial. My shot was first week Dec. Just had my 2nd blood draw. I was told that Janssen will likely unblind by mid or end of Feb. The partner institution is Tulane. 

It seems that once a vaccine gets EUA or full authorization the trial has to inform all participants as to if it’s the “real juice” or saline shot. It’s required as part of the informed consent for the trial to be allowed. Trials have some sort of a “Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects” for all trials at big Health Science Centers (teaching hospital systems). Just how it’s done seems to be somewhat interdependent on the partner institution. If they are one that has all sorts of regular clinical trials done, they have a notification systems all in place. But if it’s more of a smaller clinic that’s doing your trial, probably not so proactive. 

If that’s the case & if you want, I’d suggest that you send them an email asking that since Moderna now has EUA when it will be unblinded. And If you possibly are in a group that could get the vaccine right now (like your a HCW or your over 70/75), I’d mention that as well as you do NOT want to turn down the opportunity to get the vaccine which if they don’t tell you your trial status could place your health in jeopardy. Good luck & I hope you got the good juice!😷❣️",kqlbzm,2021-01-06 18:01:47

Agreed.,kmc6n2,2020-12-29 12:52:52
"Yes there are indeed;

It all stems from an anti-vax info graphic that was circulated a number of weeks before the release of the vaccine. It basically said that the spike protein that the vaccine  expresses antibodies against, is the same as spoke protein that’s expressed in vaginal, cervical and placental tissues in humans. 

Apart from actually being a variant spike protein, there is very little in common between syncitin-1 (the human spike protein) and the spike protein the antibodies are targeted against. If you look at the amino acid alignments In terms of what is produced by the vaccine, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the human syncitin-1 receptor. the vaccine matches the covid protein 100% while not matching the human protein even at all closely. 

It’s important here to understand how an mRNA vaccine works on a physical level abs how it’s stopping covid from doing its thing. When the virus infects you, much like other viruses it hijacks your cells machinery and forces it to produce these spike proteins in the cell surface. The spike protein is basically a protein anchor that allows one infected cell to attach itself to an in infected cell and continue its reproductive cycle. What the vaccine does, is forced the expression of antibodies targeted against these spike. So where cells express these, the antibody will go bind to it and block the infected cell from attaching to any other cells. 

Now a little more important science here is that the antibodies don’t target against specific amino acid sequences they target against physical structures. The reason the antibody will bind to covid spike proteins and not the human protein is because that mismatch in the amino acid sequence causes a completely different physical shape to be made. The antibody couldn’t bind to it even if it wanted to think it like a lock and key. The key (antibody) will fit in the front door and work because that’s what it’s designed to fit, but if you tried to open your car with it, it would do nothing at all because even though it’s a key, it’s not the right lock. 

On top of that, although we don’t have specific pregnancy data for the study because we don’t use pregnant women for study groups in early trials, there were actually 12 ladies who fell pregnant during the trials. They have been monitored very closely and they have had no adverse effects, all foetal developmental milestones have been met so far, and scans show no physical deformities with the child. As I’ve stated above there’s literally no reason to believe it would because it’s literally not physically possible but it’s still good to know as much as possible anyway. None of the ladies have delivered yet which is the only downfall so we don’t know anything other than what I’ve given you so far on that front. 

Suffice it to say there are no valid reasons as to how it would be physically possible for infertility to arise as a complication. Bearing in mind that in not a single study participant that was female or male, has there been any recorded fertility issues and that’s across 70,000 in the original studies and now that the vaccines have been rolled out, over a million individuals total have been vaccinated. 

As I alluded to earlier, the flip side of this coin is not no problems at all. Covid infection is well established to result in fertility issues. So that’s something you need to take into account as well. Not getting vaccinated leaves you at a higher risk for fertility issues than getting vaccinated does if you weigh up the odds of a fertility based adverse event from the vaccine against the odds of a fertility based complication arising from covid infection.",km01qh,2020-12-29 00:12:20
"I gotta say that's a new one. 

What exactly are they claiming?   Because based off your question the only answer i can give is just ""no.""

There's nothing in the publicly available data suggesting there would be any impact on fertility. Additionally,  to make it through FDA approval a drug needs to address this question specifically.   If there were any indication from any study of affecting fertility the FDA would need to say so.",km01qh,2020-12-28 22:19:28

"And their claim is literally that the COVID vaccine is possibly causing infertility (as simple as that). This claim is due (as I understood) from the Bill and Melinda Gate foundation involvement in reproductive health in countries with poor contraception methods. Also Bill Gates apparently spoke in some interview on his view on overpopulation and how damaging it can be in the long term.

That's a summary of what I've been hearing the past days. I do not second this reasoning and hope it's not out of place on this sub, just since you asked I thought I'd expend a bit more on where this is coming from.",km01qh,2020-12-28 23:35:44
Thank you for your awnser. I was not aware of the FDA needing to specify this. So what you are saying if I understood it right is that for a drug to pass FDA approval it is obliged to be tested in regards to its effect on fertility? Is there any official FDA document related to the COVID vaccine available out there that can clearly show the veracity of that claim ?,km01qh,2020-12-28 23:13:19
"As far as I’m aware, none of them are far enough along to have delivered at this stage and so the Trial advisors and scientific officers will be wanting to ensure they can release the data with full follow up studies. I imagine it will be a while yet. Technically we should know now because the study is finished and unblinded but with these ladies still being followed up individually I reckon that will be withheld until the previously mentioned follow up studies are done.",km01qh,2020-12-29 08:38:10
"Oh God the Bill Gates conspiracies. It's like they just mash up all the conspiracies together. I'm going to try to pull them apart.   


1) Infertility: This seems to stem from some suggestion that a molecule within the vaccine vaguely resembles a molecule that has something to do with fertility. The NYT summarizes it well--it should not have a paywall, but it might. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/technology/pfizer-vaccine-infertility-disinformation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/technology/pfizer-vaccine-infertility-disinformation.html)  


With regard to your questions about the FDA--the FDA is required to publish specific information, often called ""the insert."" I don't think it's available in its standard form yet since the vaccines have been approved under an EUA, but a fact sheet that goes into great detail about the vaccine, the trials, etc, can be found here: [https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download)  


HOWEVER, and I can't stress this enough, this fact sheet and the insert aren't meant for laypeople. It's a regulatory document using the appropriate language and referring back to certain regulations and laws, etc. The language is very specific--one example is ""adverse events,"" which antivax people tend to assume means side effects. It doesn't. It means any medical event that happened during the course of a trial, without regard to causality--gun shots are included, as are car accidents and broken legs. There are some good guides to reading inserts, but really, there are better places to find the information, written for laypeople. These would include AAP, CDC, etc.   


2) Bill Gates. He has a lot of money that he donates to a foundation bearing his own name. That foundation is involved in a lot of global health work, including reproductive health--HE isn't, as an individual, but his foundation, which employs experts in their fields across the globe, is--with the express involvement of the countries themselves.   


His line about overpopulation was a well-recognized health theory that vaccines and other access to evidence-based preventative health care would likely result in women having fewer children, as they can expect the children they do have to survive to adulthood (keep in mind that not so very long ago, 50% of kids died before age 5.) There's a whole lot more to this, but it isn't about sterilization--it's about access to safe water and food, health care, education, and agency within local economies. This would ""end"" the explosive population growth we've seen in the last 70 or so years--the population would stabilize over time, issues with poverty would decline, etc.",km01qh,2020-12-29 00:21:32
"They're called ""guidance for industry"" documents and they're available on the FDA's website (on mobile so I can't quickly get them).  

These tell industry broadly what kind of data will be required for approval. There are a lot of areas that need to be studied prior to approval.",km01qh,2020-12-29 00:54:03
I was wondering if the participants would ever find out if they got the placebo or vaccine.  It sounds like you’re saying that at the end of the trial they do learn that.  I’m glad.   It would be weird to never find out.,km01qh,2020-12-29 19:07:04

"I can answer some of your questions 

2b. No the aluminum does not split into elemental aluminum once inside your body.  There probably is better research on the occurrence of Al(OH3).  However there is not enough in a vaccine to cause poisoning, unless you’re allergic to aluminum.

3a. The maximum safe level is based on the compound that contains aluminum and not aluminum itself.  Think of chlorine (Cl) we all know NaCl or sodium chloride it’s safe because it’s salt and we eat it all the time.  Elemental Cl is deadly in small amounts.  We don’t die from the compound but do die from the element.  Similarly aluminum will be measured by what is potentially toxic. (As a compound)

Edit: clarification",kl5ktl,2020-12-27 16:20:22
"In terms of your first two questions, the Aluminum Adjuvant in vaccines boosts the immune response when you are vaccinated, which holds a critical purpose in vaccines. The use of aluminum is safe because it is one of the most common elements in the Earth’s crust, meaning it is present in almost all of our food, therefore the small doses of aluminum used in vaccines are not dangerous as the levels are much lower than what is found naturally in the body or nature.",kl5ktl,2020-12-31 22:25:49

"Well no it’s based on the toxicity of the compound.  If you are taking a nontoxic compound it won’t count to your amount.

Edit:

I used salt as an example because it doesn’t matter how much salt you eat you won’t die of Cl poisoning.  Hence it is not your Cl allowance.

Similarly the aluminum is in a non toxic compound so it doesn’t matter how much you take in you’re most likely not going to be sick from aluminum poisoning.",kl5ktl,2020-12-29 05:07:52
"Your research on if aluminum becomes a compound won’t have clear results.  The answer is really yes and no.  But for ease I have to answer no.

Yes:complex

Bonds between atoms dissolve all the time, but a new bond will be available in time with an apposing atom to form the same compound fast enough that the time Aluminum is an element on its own should be negligible.  Secondly to break the bond between two atoms takes force and energy.  You need energy or the right compound in your body to break apart the aluminum compound.  Not only that but break the aluminum into its elemental form without erroneous binding and destabilization of the element.  In general aluminum will find a way to be stable at all cost and cannot as a compound return to its elemental form.(unless you meet the correct criteria)",kl5ktl,2020-12-29 07:12:13

"With a typical virus, once you have developed immunity, there is a memory effect in which the antibodies may drop off but your body keeps a small set of “memory” immune cells.  So a few decades later, you encounter that virus and even though your antibody levels have dropped very low, that virus will eventually be presented in the lymph nodes where those memory cells are and they will respond by rapidly dividing and cranking out antibodies and cytotoxic T cells.

But rabies virus is different.  Like all viruses, it has tricks to evade the immune system, but while most viruses get in a race with the immune system that they win if they can transmit before there is immunity, rabies is *slow.* That’s why people can take months or sometimes a few years to develop symptoms.  And because it’s so slow, it doesn’t stimulate the immune system on re-exposure.

So the only way to stop it is to use a vaccine to stimulate a robust antibody response before it can get into the central nervous system.

Tetanus is similar, although it’s not a virus.  Tetanus toxin is so toxic that the amount required to raise an immune response would kill you many times over.  So we make the vaccine by inactivating the toxin with formaldehyde and then using that to generate the immune response.  You must have circulating antibodies to prevent the toxin from getting into cells, which is why we give you a booster every ten years.",kk8q82,2020-12-26 01:26:10

"We run a program in school for students who have a fear of vaccinations (we're in Canada and we have immunization programs as part of school). I've copied some of the main points below. Hope it's helpful. Being afraid is perfectly normal! It comes down to 4 things. 

**Be comfortable**: Wear short sleeves, eat a snack, bring something that makes you happy, sit up in the chair, make your arm as loose as you can. If you do feel any dizziness, tense your stomach and leg muscles. Tell the nurse/doctor if you feel dizzy though, they can help too.

**Don't hold back questions:** A big part of fear is not feeling like you know enough. Make sure you ask the nurse or doctor any questions you have. Things like ""What will happen"", ""Can I bring a friend"", ""Can I look at it/not look at it"" - whatever worries you!

**Try to relax**. I know it's hard to stay calm and relaxed when someone tells you to be calm and relaxed, but here's some tips. Do belly breathing (pretend to blow out a candle). Talk to yourself (be your own hype person! Tell yourself you can do it). Have a friend or family member hold your hand or be with you. If you're in a public place, see if you can get a more private room. 

**And distract yourself.** A lot of people get increasingly worried because they can't stop thinking about it. Instead, when the time comes try to distract yourself, even a little. Talk to someone. Play video games. Read a book. Play music. We've even had some students just sing!

"If you are worried about the safety of vaccinations, it is important to know that vaccines are safe. Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once it is on the market. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information from several sources for any sign that a vaccine may cause an adverse event. In terms of side-effects, most vaccine reactions are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever, and the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the risks. 

These links provide useful information about vaccine safety that could be comforting:

"Weird, whether your country recommends boosters periodically or not, I'd never describe the pertussis vaccination schedule as a ""one and done"".

First you've got the primary vaccination course during infancy, which is at least two doses, depending on where you are in the world and whether or not the mother was vaccinated during pregnancy (see the Dutch recommendations for that one). Then there's the infancy booster to finish that series.

Some countries will recommend at least one booster dose between the end of infancy and adolescence. Some countries will then recommend the start of periodic adult boosters every 10-20 years, given that protection wanes. If the individual is going to be around infants then additional boosters are recommended there too, if the country practices ""cocooning"". Infection for an adult is nothing to be concerned about, but passing it on to an infant who hasn't started their primary vaccination can be fatal, hence boosters for ""cocooning"".

But ""one and done""? No chance. Whereabouts in the world are you? The ACIP recommends adolescent and adulthood boosters:

> In 2005, ACIP recommended that adolescents and adults receive a single dose of a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (4,5). After receipt of Tdap, adolescents and adults are recommended to receive a booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine every 10 years or when indicated for wound management (4,5). In 2012, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, ACIP recommended a dose of Tdap for women during each pregnancy (6).

"I decided to get vaccinated with the nonavalent vaccine because it covers more strains. It doesn’t make sense for the cdc to not recommend that people previously vaccinated with the quadrivalent vaccine, to not get vaccinated with the gardasil 9 as it covers more strains. There is also a study that shows that women who were previously vaccinated with the quadrivalent vaccine were more prone to acquire a high risk strain not covered by the vaccine, than women who never got the vaccine. I believe it because I ended up getting a high risk hpv strain that wasn’t covered by the vaccine. There’s also a bunch of other high risk strains that aren’t even included in the new gardasil 9... which still leaves us all exposed. The government is fraudulent when it comes to hpv.. people think that once they get the vaccine they’re good and that’s not the case. You’re still at risk for catching a high risk strain not covered by the vaccine. Instead of the country pushing gardasil9 so much making people believe that it’s going to completely save them from hpv, they need to start approving therapeutic vaccines for hpv and creating a new vaccine that COVERS ALL HIGH RISK STRAINS once and for all!",kgryid,2020-12-21 08:43:09

"I actually am a vaccine researcher, and I have anti-vaxxers in the my extended family. I always like to ask about the end game. What is in it for whom for one to get a vaccine? I generally hear something along the lines of ""money for big pharma."" I do find they are often surprised to learn that vaccines account a very small revenue for biopharma. In fact, it is much more of a financial interest to develop treatments than cures. And in fact, there was a ton of money that went into R and D to develop antibody therapeutics for the virus. However, the vaccine ended up working (and predictably so), and all the large biotech are quickly abandoning these treatments.

Suffice it to say that there is a big difference between putting a tracking label/chip on the outside of the glass vial of the vaccine, which could be scanned during shipping & storage to keep track of information related to manufacturing conditions & lot number, vs. putting a tracking device inside of the actual vaccine… which no one has proposed and is not part of any of the actual COVID-19 vaccines.

They'll often downplay the Virus by saying something along the lines of ""Why do we need a Vaccine that's only 95% effective for a Vaccine with a 99% Survival rate""

To answer this question, we should first  establish what it means to be 95% effective before we answer the question at hand. This would be my response:

You may have heard that a vaccine is “95% effective,” but what does that number actually mean? To put it simply, it means that your risk of getting symptomatic COVID-19 is reduced by 95% from whatever it was without the vaccine (a 20-fold reduction, in this case).
It’s probably helpful to take a step back and describe how the COVID-19 trials are designed. The COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials are double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies. What does that mean? 

When people sign up to join the studies, they are told that they will be randomly assigned to receive either the actual COVID-19 vaccine or a placebo (a sham-injection of regular salt-water). The trick is that neither the participant nor the medical providers know if the patient got the vaccine or the placebo… this information is only revealed at the very end of the trial.

The purpose of this design is to make sure that people who received the vaccine do not behave differently than everyone else. For example, you might imagine that someone who knew that they got the real vaccine might be more confident meeting up with friends, going to crowded areas, etc., exposing themselves more, which might make it look like the vaccine was not working.

By obscuring the knowledge of whether each person in the trial received the placebo or the real vaccine, it makes it easier to compare the actual efficacy of the vaccine (how well it’s working): if there are way fewer COVID-19 cases among the people in the vaccinated group compared to the people who got the sham-injection, that means that the vaccine is probably protecting them.

For example, a big phase 3 trial may involve vaccinating ~15,000 people with the real vaccine, giving another ~15,000 a salt-water placebo injection (with no vaccine), and then waiting to see which group ends up having more diagnoses of COVID-19 over time. They do not intentionally expose people to the virus, they just wait and observe them after going about daily life. If there is a big difference in the rates of COVID-19 in the vaccine vs. placebo group, you know that the vaccine is helping prevent disease.

Let’s look at some real data as an example here. In the recently reported FDA vaccine clinical data packet for the Pfizer trials, they compared the relative rates of infection over time among the vaccinated group (blue line) and the placebo group (red line), shown below. An increase on the Y-axis means that there were more COVID diagnoses. The X-axis represents the number of days after the vaccine or placebo was administered. 
Two things should be clear from this chart:

The vaccine takes ~14 days after the first dose to start working (like we discussed above). This is clear in the below data chart because, for the first 14 days, there is a similar rate of increasing COVID-19 cases across both the red and blue groups.

 After 14 days, the rate of new COVID-19 infections in the vaccinated group (blue line) is way lower than the placebo group (red line), meaning that there were far fewer new infections in the blue/vaccinated group.

The “blue” (vaccinated) group had far fewer COVID diagnoses than the red (placebo) group, after they were at least 14 days’ past their first dose of vaccine.

Why would anyone want a vaccine that is 95% effective if they personally have a 99% chance of survival?

If you haven’t read the prior section yet, I would recommend that you read that one before this one. Understanding what they mean by “the vaccine is 95% effective” is crucial. At face value, if you just compare numbers, it may seem strange to want to take a vaccine that is “only” 95% effective if you think your personal rate of survival is already 99%, based on your estimate of your own risk factors.

However, a vaccine effectiveness of 95% means that it reduces your risk by 95% from whatever it would have been if you didn’t take the vaccine. It definitely does not mean that there is a 95% chance that it protects and a 5% chance that it gives you COVID-19, or anything like that. So, if you think you had 99% chance of being fine before, now it’s 99.95% — a pretty good upgrade. 

Further, the “99%” is only discussing mortality. It may be even more attractive if you also have a 95% reduction in risk of developing lung scars, brain damage, heart/vascular damage, etc.

Even if a hypothetical vaccine was only 50% effective, that would still be decently helpful, because it would take whatever risk you had without the vaccine and cut it in half. We will have to wait to see how long the protection lasts from the COVID vaccines, but the above data from the Pfizer study suggests that they’re providing pretty good protection for at least a few months.

"Most vaccines immunize you by activating your immune system. This forces your body to react to that disease. Then when you get the full version of the disease, your body is already able to fight. Think of it like people coming over for dinner. If you know people are coming, you can move quickly that day to prepare. You can serve and clean up easily. This is vaccinated you. If you don’t know, it takes longer to prep and bounce back from the surprise. It takes longer to serve and clean up takes longer. This is unvaccinated you.

If you have immune problems, you need to talk to the doctor who helps you manage that. They are more aware of what could trigger you and give you more information.",kfp31y,2020-12-18 18:38:56
"Most vaccines function by inserting a weaker version of the virus inside you. That is not the case with these mRNA vaccines. See [explanation here.](https://blog.labtag.com/the-development-function-of-mrna-vaccines/)

 Vaccines traditionally contain either a weakened or attenuated virus or purified signature virus proteins, which they use to train the immune system to recognize the disease-causing virus. mRNA vaccines work differently, as they don’t contain any viral material. Instead, they contain genetic material that encodes for a specific viral protein. The body then uses this genetic information to translate the mRNA into viral protein directly inside human cells. This mimics the approach used by various viruses, providing the immune system a preview of what the real virus will look like and allows the system to begin to build an immune response. As the antigen is produced within the cell, it can stimulate cellular immunity (involving cytokines and T-cells) as well as humoral immunity (involving antibodies and complement proteins).",kfp31y,2020-12-18 20:49:36
"There are many different “types” of vaccines, but they all work in basically the same way:

prepare a less-dangerous version of a virus or bacterium (or perhaps just a small protein from the pathogen)

show it to the immune system

wait 2 weeks for the immune system to prepare its response.


The immune response to a new target takes about two weeks to give you protection. (This is why vaccines are mostly only helpful if you get them prior to an actual infection, not once you are already infected).

When you get a vaccine injection for a virus, it usually contains either a small piece of a viral protein or a non-infectious version of the virus. This allows your immune cells to recognize the shapes of the molecules on that virus. Over the next few weeks, those immune cells grow more of themselves and produce antibodies so that when they encounter the virus in the future, they are ready to defend against the infection. Since the vaccine itself does not contain the actual infectious virus, this allows your immune system to “train” against the virus without posing a risk of actually causing the disease.

 CDC: “how do vaccines work?”


How do mRNA vaccines work?

Traditional vaccine formats often are based around a viral protein, such as the spike protein on the outside of the virus that causes COVID-19. mRNA vaccines are slightly different; instead of injecting that protein directly, they include a small piece of the RNA that can be used to produce that piece of the virus (in this case, the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19).

The mRNA vaccines do not encode the entire virus — they only lead to the production of a small piece of the outermost part of the virus. As a result, they are not infectious, and do not self-replicate.",kfp31y,2020-12-19 20:55:01
"The vaccines work like you’re learning for a test. If I give you a hard math problem right now, you probably will not solve it. With a vaccine, you inject dead or weakened parts of a virus. Your immunesystem learns from this and learns to recognize and attack these viruses. It’s like you’re learning for the math problem. Next time you get the math problem, you will succeed in solving it, as you’ve learnt for it. And that’s how vaccines are work in simple language",kfp31y,2020-12-23 00:30:10

"HPV (Human papillomavirus) can cause warts. However, there are are some 100+ strains of HPV, most of which do absolutely nothing for most people. Several strains cause plantar warts, which are harmless if unsightly. A small handful of the strains can cause genital warts which are also *usually* harmless if very unsightly, but do increase the risk of cervical cancer slightly. A tiny handful of HPV strains are high-risk and likely to lead to cervical cancer. The vaccine for HPV is against these strains, specifically. Given the risk of cervical cancer, and given how available the vaccine is, there's no reason *not* to get the vaccine.

Meningitis is an infection that can lead to inflammation of the tissues around the brain, resulting in death or brain damage. 

Hep A is a virus which eventually destroys the liver, which you need to live.   Sort of like decades of heavy binge drinking without the fun.

Second thing I want to say is that people are entitled to make decisions based on their own understanding of a variety of topics. In this case, I would try to explain that there is no scientific evidence that supports the idea that vaccines cause or increases the severity of autism. This false idea has been pioneered by individuals with conflicts of interest who employed fraudulent scientific practices. A reason that this vaccine-causes-autism movement is so wide-reaching is because people have a tendency to believe in the cause-effect myth: (event B [autism] being caused by event A [vaccines] if event A precedes event B. When in reality the 2 events are unrelated). 

Typically supporters of this anti-vax idea are directly or indirectly affected by autism, and their beliefs are anecdotal and not supported by science. However, given the emotional impact that is attached to autism, it is human for some people to not want to take the risk and to avoid vaccination all together. There is no ill will behind refusing to vaccinate a child because a life is so precious and to that individual’s knowledge they truly dont know the science behind whats going into your body (its hard for people to just take the scientists word for it), however, what I believe is overlooked by antivaxers is the downstream implications of refusing vaccination resulting in emergence of diseases that could and should be controlled.

Pfizer however estimates that they will finish the clinical trial III in 2022/2023, which means that adverse effects are practically unknown. Both long term adverse affects as well as adverse effects to specific groups (e.g. immune-compromised).

Even if there are some side effects that aren't known yet, it seems almost certain that much more lives will be saved by releasing a vaccine now rather than delaying it.

"Yes, this is a very unpopular opinion and rightfully so. We are talking about people's lives here.

As for the unknown possible adverse effects of the new vaccine(s) that will become available **before** the clinical trials III conclude, they fall into two categories;

1) Long-term and in all likelihood **rare** adverse effects (regardless their severity)

2) Allergic reactions and possible interactions with drugs. Especially the first is what scares me the most because I have no reason to expect those to be ""rare"" and they are life-threatening. Even the flu vaccine can cause allergic reaction(s) to people allergic to eggs and/or chicken.

In my view there is no such thing as ""safe"" drug/vaccine. ""Safe"" for whom? When? What? With what? How much? Instead there is **safety profile**, that determines all the above and more and which an MD can use in order to make informed decisions based at science and not chance or guessing or hoping, which is what we will get now with the covid vaccines.

And I am not saying that they are ""dangerous"", I am saying that we don't know their safety profile. And we won't know till 2022/2023.

Many people who initially have COVID antibodies after recovery have their antibody titers wane after some time. I would expect that we'll be recommending vaccination to these people to get some more long-standing immunity.,kcr9pu,2020-12-15 13:34:25
"immunity from an infection is not necessarily better than from a vaccine. 
For example, a recent update from the Moderna mRNA vaccine was published December 3rd, 2020, and found that, among a sample of 34 patients who received vaccines in some of the earlier trials, all of them still had antibodies 3 months after their final booster shot. This sample of patients included some patients who were over the age of 71, who also exhibited durable antibody responses. From looking at the chart of their antibody levels over time, it is clear that the levels are slowly going down over time, but this indicates that the vaccine should provide at least several months of protection.

A similar type of data analysis of antibody levels in patients who received the Pfizer vaccine compared the amount of antibodies that the vaccinated people had against the amount of antibodies in the blood of people who had recovered from an actual COVID-19 infection, and found that the vaccine appeared to actually lead to 2x-4x more antibodies compared to a set of recovered patient samples (after real COVID-19 infections). 

Combining these findings with the evidence of protection against symptomatic COVID-19 seen from the clinical trial results, it seems that the immunity that you gain from the vaccines has a good chance of lasting for at least a few months. However, looking at antibody levels alone doesn’t tell the whole story, so the real comparison will come from following the clinical trial patients in the months to come to see how long they are protected.",kcr9pu,2020-12-19 20:59:12

For products currently licensed (MMR, DTaP) there may be a move to change these ( although right now the mRNA vaccine is a single product not a combo, regulatory hurdles for combos are tricky) eventually but established vaccine work, are old enough to be cash cows and probably won’t change much 

Seasonal vaccines like flu may move to this tech because you can pivot a little quicker if there needs to be a change of strain ( but again combo)

"The flu vaccine has to be changed every year to take into account the 3 or 4 most commonly circulating strains at the time. However, this decision on what strains are to be included in the vaccine happens 6-8 months before the flu season starts, so the people making that decision (generally the WHO and their assembled experts) are making predictions.

Sometimes they get it wrong and other strains circulate that are not in the vaccine. Sometimes they get it right but one or more strains mutate a bit, meaning the vaccine is less efficacious.

It's worth noting that there's no one single estimate of vaccine efficacy for the influenza vaccines. There are loads of vaccines for influenza made every year, some work better in children and some work better in adults. A single estimate (like that ~45% you've cited) hides a heck of a lot of details and nuance.

On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 seems relatively stable and therefore the vaccines only need to protect against one single type of the virus. There have been some minor mutations, but nothing (as of today) that would make a vaccine less effective.",k9uo21,2020-12-09 17:04:12
"There are a few issues OTHER than the need to predict the circulating strains.  Even when the flu vaccine is well-matched to circulating strains, vaccine efficacy seldom exceeds 60%.

Some hypotheses:

1) influenza vaccines are propagated on eggs.  This may lead to antigenic changes that decrease vaccine efficacy.  The newer vaccines that are expressed in cell-based systems, such as FLUCELVAX, which is propagated on a mammalian cell line, or FLUBLOK, which is produced by inserting the HA genes into an insect expression system using a baculovirus.  These two vaccines do show modestly higher efficacy than the egg-based preparations.

2) The current vaccines (other than FLUBLOK) are prepared by taking whole virus and disrupting it with either beta propriolactone or formaldehyde.  The beta prop or formaldehyde are removed and the vaccine is standardized, buffered, and put into syringes.  For FLUBLOK, the vaccine contains only 45mcg of each HA and some buffers and stabilizers.  We do not use adjuvants in our flu shots.  This tends to lead to a weak and short-lived immune response.  

I suspect that if we made our flu shots as mRNA vaccines or as adjuvanted nanoparticles, we might see much higher efficacy.",k9uo21,2020-12-09 20:40:21

"Because the current flu processes take time and resources.  And are kind of time constrained- flu doses need to be available in Augustish in time for flu season - at some point you have to draw a line and say okay here’s what we are going to include so that’s we can do the most good. 

It was only a few years ago that the 4th strain was added, plus there are some other permutations ( like high dose ) which take more effort but apparently provide an better immune response in certain groups like the elderly.

I work for one of the flu vaccine manufacturers and we make Flu vaccine for Northern hemisphere from Jan- Septemberish.

The FDA staff has engaged in ‘round-the-clock work even as they have remained focused on meeting the FDA’s regular, mission-critical public health responsibilities. 

We’ve also worked to identify ways to increase coordination of scientific leadership, agency operations, communications, and programming for all regulated products.  In June, we launched the COVID-19 Pandemic Recovery and Preparedness Plan (or PREPP), which is helping to support this kind of collaboration and communicating across the agency.

One model of this is the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP), a special emergency program initiated by our Centers for Drug Evaluation and Research and Biologics Evaluation and Research that increases coordination for moving new treatments to patients as quickly as possible, while maintaining our focus on safety. 

When CTAP was initially launched, 72 clinical trials of potential therapies for COVID-19 were underway with FDA oversight. As of October 31, more than 560 drug development programs were in planning stages.  In addition, FDA has reviewed over 370 trials,  and authorized 5 COVID-19 treatments for emergency use, and  approved 1 treatment for use in COVID-19. 

While speed in reviewing these products is important, so is ensuring that any approval or authorized vaccine meets the Agency’s rigorous standards for safety, accuracy and effectiveness.  And we will not authorize or approve any COVID-19 vaccine until such an approval or authorization meets the relevant statutory standard.",k9xhhv,2020-12-09 18:30:02

"> How can people be confident that these Covid vaccines that are being released are dependable and ready for mass distribution without knowing the long term side-effects? Like zero sample data for 3-5 year effects.

It's worth noting that the most serious of ""long-term"" side effects in existing vaccines occur within 6 weeks of vaccination. The phase 3 clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines that are almost ready for use used follow-up periods of 60 days.

The short-term reactogenicity results were comparable to other vaccines. The rates of fevers, sore arms, chills and all that were nothing out of the ordinary. More serious side effects that occur a few weeks after vaccination with other vaccines did not transpire with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. 

If you want to know what ""long-term"" side effects might happen 3-5 years after vaccination then here's what you need to do:

1. Define *precisely* what those effects are, and in what frequency they occur with existing non-COVID vaccines. What exactly is the threshold that would make you say ""uh oh, this is too high"", compared to the flu vaccine/measles vaccine/pertussis vaccine, etc. But you need to be precise with what you consider to be a vaccine-attributable side effect and what would just be an unrelated condition. Following-up people for 3-5 years to see if anything happens to them is bound to find something, but you need to be sure that it's vaccine-attributable and not just another condition that was diagnosed but not related.

2. Tell all of the countries all around the world to not use the new COVID-19 vaccines until your 3-5 year study period has elapsed and you've reported your results. Good luck with that.

Don't worry, all countries that use these vaccines will be monitoring their long-term safety for years to come. Heck, that's how the authorities in Finland and the UK discovered that one of the  2009pdmH1N1 vaccines triggered narcolepsy in some patients - Phase 4 surveillance.

"Three off the top of my head:

1) New pneumococcal vaccines with a greater number of serotypes. PCV15 and perhaps PCV20 are a few years away, both big improvements on PCV13 and PCV10 that are currently used today.

The pneumococcus is a bacteria that is quite content to live in your nose and not cause you any hassle. However, if you manage to move it from your nose into your lungs, or another site like your blood circulation system, then you'll likely have some serious issues. There are many different types of the bacteria called serotypes, and different vaccines protect against a different number of those serotypes.

Most babies in the developed world will receive either PCV10 (with protection against 10 serotypes) or PCV13 (13 serotypes) during their first year of life. The vaccine is also available to less-developed countries through the Gates Foundation and associated charities. Some elderly adults might receive a dose too, because the pneumococcus causes severe problems in the elderly too. Having vaccines with a greater coverage of serotypes means the burden of disease caused by this bacteria should reduce.

2) More effective flu vaccines are being developed or are close to national approval in some countries. Several countries have recommendations for adjuvanted flu vaccines and high dose flu vaccines that work better than ""standard"" vaccines. Adjuvanted high dose vaccines ought to be on the way. The big search in this area is for the universal flu vaccine, one that you receive in winter that will cover you against *all* strains of flu and not just the 3 or 4 in existing vaccines. It might also mean you don't need an annual vaccine if protection lasts a long time, as you won't need to worry about antigenic shift or drift.

3) Meningococcal vaccines protecting against more serogroups. Current meningococcal vaccines protect against serogroups B, or C, or A+C+W+Y, depending on the vaccine you receive. The vaccines against serogroups A, C, W and Y are relatively cheap, whereas the vaccines against serogroup B are very expensive. Combining the two to make a vaccine for A+B+C+W+Y means infants would potentially receive fewer injections during their schedule (making the schedule easier to follow and potentially higher coverage as a result) but it might be more cost-effective for health authorities to use one vaccine for all 5 serogroups rather than 2 or more. Time will tell on that last point.",k84tvv,2020-12-07 09:53:26

"There is a long list. There are currently active vaccine candidates for malaria, Chikungunya, Zika, C. diff, Lyme disease, and many others.

Other than feeling icky for half a day after the second shot (nausea, chills, headache), which got better after ibuprofen and a nap, I have not noticed any side effects.  

The mRNA vaccines don't have the virus--they have instructions to build a small part of the virus.

The way it works, the mRNA is smuggled into your cells by a lipid envelope.  Once in the cells, the mRNA is processed by ribosomes to create the protein encoded by the vaccine, this case the spike protein.

Then your cells spit out the spike protein, which is attacked by your immune system as being an invader.

The mRNA doesn't survive long in your cells and breaks down into junk that is cleaned up by the cell's garbage collection mechanisms (digestive enzymes etc.)

15,000 volunteers got the mrna-1273 vaccine and there were no serious medical events recorded at the normal dose.

"Most likely they won't have new contraindications. Why is that? Because vaccines don't really affect the body that much so precautions and contraindications stick to an allergy to the ingredients (the adjuvants), thrombocytopenia, an acute moderate/severe infection with fever usually higher than 38.5 Celsius degrees. Unless they're oral or live attenuated, it's unlikely many of these precautions will change, because stimulating the immune system with a vaccine, doesn't affect the body that much (hence why we need boosters, cause otherwise we might not form enough antibodies since the antigen is not triggering a high enough immune response). High blood pressure, any cardiac or pulmonary illnesses are not contraindications for any vaccine. In fact, a perfect candidate to get any vaccine against an infection that could be fatal, especially sars cov 2, is the patient who has diabetes, cardiovascular or pulmonary history. They're the most vulnerable and luckily, their medical history isn't a precaution for the vaccine, but actually an indication.",k7wkc4,2020-12-08 21:27:33

While hormones for fertility will have an impact on gene expression and cell cycle throughout the body, and particularly in the uterus, ovaries, and perhaps the pituitary gland, I don’t see much in the way of B cell and T cell anti viral issues being a problem.

"> are there long term effects of this vaccine?

This is something that a lot of people are asking at the moment, but I don't understand the question.

For short term reactogenicity we have some data available. The COVID-19 vaccines that are at the latter stages of development have phase 1 and phase 2 trial data published. Some will have phase 3 trial data published very soon, so we have an excellent idea of short-term reactions...both their nature and their frequency.

For ""long term"" reactions, what do these people mean? What is the baseline...what vaccine(s) have been used in the past that have had a known and acceptable short-term reactogenicity profile but perception of them has changed several years down the line? What were those particular reactions that caused people to turn against the vaccine(s)? What was the frequency of those reactions? How are people defining ""long term"" in the first place?

Nobody knows anything ""long term"" about the COVID-19 vaccine at all, they were all first used in humans several months ago so our ""long term"" knowledge of them extends that far...several months.

Some people on news channels and phone-ins (not OP, thankfully) are making the argument that they won't get the vaccine until ""long term effects"" are known...some are even going as far to say that nobody should be getting the vaccine until ""long term effects"" are known. Yeah, good luck with that - the entire world has been waiting for the chance to get back to normal but we're not allowed to use a vaccine for a poorly defined period of time to wait and see if the test subjects develop some undefined health outcomes.",k5nkpr,2020-12-03 15:43:01
Long term effect is immunity 🤣,k5nkpr,2020-12-03 03:12:01
"Well, I will be first in line if I can be. Old and vulnerable and all that, yeah. I don't care if I get a fever - that's what usually happens when I get a flu vaccine. Years ago, when I went to Peru, they required a whole bunch of vaccines. Had to get them on different days because they did cause reactions. After one - it was either for typhoid or typhus, I got a fever that night and passed out -in bed, lying down! Scared my husband; he initially thought it was an anaphylactic reaction and he thought he'd have to do CPR! But I came to fast, probably under a minute, but very disoriented for about 10 minutes, and weak and feverish for a day. That was the worst. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen would have prevented the passing out, because that was from the fever.  This was before it was routinely advised to take acetaminophen after a vaccine to prevent fever.

But for this Covid vaccine, I am much more concerned about getting Covid than getting the vaccine, because, aside from the temporary fever, modern vaccines to my knowledge don't cause serious problems. Not like in the 1950s - some of the polio vaccine was messed up - I think it was a live vaccine. Someone I know got polio from it, but luckily it was a mild case. Lasted 2 weeks, and caused no disability. (Most cases of polio were actually very mild - apparently, like Covid, the vast majority of people got very mild, asymptomatic cases and did not know they had it. And, it doesn't have airborne spread like Covid. But the people who got serious cases had huge problems, if they survived.)

With reports of even young people with mild Covid illnesses getting cardiomyopathy or long term lung damage, this virus is nothing to mess with. 

If the immunity doesn't last, no big deal. If I have to get a booster every 6 months, I will.

I think some people have never seen or cannot imagine what it is like when someone dies of ARDS or sepsis in the ICU like these Covid patients. If they had ever seen that, they too would be camping out to be first in line for these vaccinations. 

I do usually ""wait and see"" when a brand new medication comes out (remember Vioxx?). But I have been in strict isolation since March. I am eager to get this vaccine and will be glad when all or most of the HCWs have had it, too. I am hoping it will prevent infection and prevent contagion, in addition to reducing or eliminating illness. But we don't know that yet. Because if it doesn't ""take"" in people with impaired immunity, they won't have much protection, if it is true that it keeps spreading among the vaccinated people.",k5nkpr,2020-12-03 18:34:08

They are downplaying this, but when asked, Pfizer and Moderna and yes, Dr. Fauci acknowledge this fact. That's why we will still need to wear masks and so forth - not just to protect unvaccinated people - to stop the spread among the vaccinated as well. I hope this does not turn out to be true, but we will have to see, from testing if the vaccine actually lowers the numbers of infected people.",k5nkpr,2020-12-03 18:54:43

"MRNA or ‘messenger RNA’ is an intrusion for your cells to produce an antigen with an active site shaped to tackle specifically Covid. 

It’s extremely simple. This antigen will be the same as billions of others you have, just with a slightly different shaped active site. The mRNA itself cannot be dangerous. It’s like a mugshot of a criminal. It has no means to hurt you. 

This vaccine is relatively unexciting. All you need is a rudimentary understanding of biology to see there’s no way for it to have unintended effects.

But does it prevent actual infection by the virus the next time the person is exposed to it? And if infected, even though the person is not ill because of the vaccine, does the vaccine at least prevent that person from transmitting that virus to another person? That is what I am getting at here. That is what all the virologists say they are not sure about. And which I hope is not true. I am concerned about this because some cancer patients have severe lymphopenia from radiation, a condition which means they cannot survive Covid, because the virus lowers the lymphocytes further. These people also may not be able to launch a normal immune response, to the virus or the vaccine. So the vaccine may not be effective with them. Ordinarily, if everyone around them is vaccinated, that would create a situation where there is no virus in the community to catch. But if Covid-immunized people actually carry the virus, they would be able to infect such people.

And while this isn't a political post, my mother is a staunch conservative and it seems like there's a lot of misinformation floating around some of those circles when it comes to science, medicine, and Covid-19 specifically. Again, this isn't a political issue or post but just trying to answer what may have contributed to my mother's outlook.

"There are local tumor immunosuppressive factors that prevent recognition of these antigens. The idea is to present them elsewhere, then have the cells traffic to the tumor.",k5glxz,2020-12-02 20:59:10
"Thanks, this makes sense clarified it a bit!

Just to be sure, these immunosuppressive factors are unique properties tumor cells  need to develop in order to avoid the immune defense, survive and actually become a tumor cell?  Or are these intrinsic properties for every cell?",k5glxz,2020-12-03 08:10:22

Intrinsic properties for every cell. Basically cancer cells have a little flag that says “I’m normal” even when they are not.  Which is how the immune system doesn’t see them.  Also every cell that is normal also has the same flag so they don’t get removed by the immune system.,k5glxz,2020-12-03 11:08:31
"It's a combination of factors, including:

1. We have a much better understanding of coronaviruses than we do of Ebola.
2. There had already been work on a vaccine due to the previous coronavirus outbreaks of SARS and MERS. The current vaccine is a continuation of that research.
3. Due to this being a worldwide pandemic that greatly affected the worldwide economy, there was much more financial incentive to create a COVID-19 vaccine than there was for smaller, more localized outbreaks.
4. Multiple companies were working on a vaccine at the same time, and the competition to be the first to produce a vaccine incentivized them to make one quickly.

By the way, the fastest vaccine ever produced was not for Ebola. It was for mumps, and that took four years to make.",k38516,2020-11-29 15:17:51
"A key part of all of this was that the phase 1, 2 and 3 trials were conducted at the same time. Vaccine manufacturers created their candidate vaccines, put it through pre-clinical trials then any successful candidate was put into all 3 stages of human trials at once.

This meant they didn't need to wait for phase 1 to finish to start phase 2, and for phase 2 to finish to start phase 3. 

Critically, regulators like the FDA and EMA were given real-time access to trial data, so that the regulatory process could be conducted at the same time as the trials. This effectively removed a huge and timely delay normally caused by bureaucracy (but as someone who works in that process, I can tell you it's 100% necessary bureaucracy!) and removes another potential source of delay.

So the speed of development has been driven by concurrent trials and the sharing of trial data in real time with regulators, among other things.",k38516,2020-11-29 16:50:22

Short answer - the reason it can be done so quickly is because FDA is prioritizing review of Covid vaccine data over everything else. Which is not how they normally work. So Covid vaccines are being bumped to the “front of the line” for safety and data review.",k38516,2020-11-29 15:14:35

Once people start getting vaccinated en masse then we'll be able to study long term issues in ""Phase 4"" studies, or surveillance studies. Every country with some form of public health service will have a vaccine surveillance service monitoring safety and effectiveness - if anyone thinks they're suffering a vaccine-link side effect they can notify the authorities, and if enough signals are received then the surveillance teams start looking closely at the data.

"The logistics are going to be very interdependent on which vaccine is the one distributed. Right now there’s all this press on Pfizer & Moderna and their requirements for subzero Artic zone storage and narrow wait time to have vials liquified to move thru a needle, 2 visits, Yada yada..... Visually it’s like a movie scene with dry ice fumes fusing up in a lab. It catches your attention. 
But there’s other trials on the horizon that are along the lines of old school conventional vaccine. The Janssen is a single shot, regular refrigeration and will likely have a 2 year shelf life. It will be like a flu shot for distribution logistics. Although it’s based on their new AdVac platform for R&D. 

It’s been interesting to see how Covid has fared in Africa. Continent wise their # are low. Part of it is younger demographics. But imo a lot has to do with folks experiencing Ebola first hand and because of this taking masks, social distancing, hygiene very seriously. Also Janssen got approval for thier Ebola vaccine last year after trials. It has made a difference. So if Janssen Covid vaccine gets EUA, there’s already trust with Janssen from their work with Ebola so folks will line up to get it in the continent. When the first Covid cases hit Spain it was in the Canary Islands as the airport there is this gigantic twin hub for long flights to/from EU and it was Covid + airline passengers. It also has ports that do the same. Anyways the western side of Africa from Morocco down put alerts to airports and harbors on Covid so controlled transmission. Folks learned from Ebola & lesser extent from MERS that you have to be proactive to prevent spread.

"I too have a high school level of biology, but on the first point, I was listening to an interview on NPR a few days ago, and the doctor they were talking to said that the extreme cold storage requirements were driven by the high fragility of mRNA.  From everything that I have heard/come across, this is comparable to saying the vaccine is like a generic version of the spike protein, where the virus itself is the brand name - on a molecular level the mRNA is essentially indistinguishable.  From this, I would expect your second point to be true, but I haven't heard an interview/read an article that talks about it specifically.

Beyond that, the lipid coating is necessary for the mRNA to be able to enter a cell, so all of the available vaccine will be taken up pretty rapidly by some random assortment of cells (which produce the spike protein) then there isn't really a mechanism for the mRNA to be transferred to another cell, even if it were somehow longer lasting (which seems not to be the case).",k0ogb6,2020-11-28 12:56:49

But talking about inserting a trans gene for part of the Covid spike protein in E1A location of an adenoviral vector simply wont help people. 

They aren’t asking enough about storage of the vaccines. The moderna vaccine can be stored in a normal freezer. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored in a -80 freezer. These are readily available at hospitals and universities, but aren’t as common in most doctors offices and pharmacies. Luckily dry ice will work.

Another thing will be speed of production. Both the mRNA vaccines should be produced at a similar rate if they had the exact same production facilities. Pfizer May have a leg up on this due to the fact that they are Pfizer. On the other hand, operation warp speed should provide moderna lots of money. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine and the Astra Zeneca vaccine will require more cell culture. There are facilities that work on gene therapy and adenoviral vectors that could contract you make these on a third party basis. I worked at a biotech firm that spun this technology out. You still have to have all the correct cell culture biologics and the people who know what they are doing.

Hope that helps.",jxd2lg,2020-11-20 00:52:24

"I think that many people are concerned about possible adverse side effects. Serious rare side effects, especially those that aren’t immediately apparent (such as narcolepsy associated with the swine flu H1N1 pandemic vaccine in some European countries but not the US—the Europeans received a different vaccine) wouldn’t necessarily show up In a phase three trial of 30,000 people, half of them vaccine recipients. 
I think it would help if all people understood the process of how serious and moderate adverse effects are monitored and reported once the vaccines are approved, and at what point consumers are notified about any side effects not previously reported. Can we rely on our very overworked doctors to report these side effects to the FDA? Is there a way for individuals experiencing adverse events, or symptoms that MAY be associated with receiving the vaccine, to personally report these? The process feels very non- transparent.

"The vaccine is made up of RNA, but does not alter your genetic code.

Here's a good basic read: [https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines](https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines)",jurzle,2020-11-15 20:02:27
"No, they don't alter your RNA.

The immune system recognizes the proteins that compose pathogens (viruses or bacteria). Historically, vaccines have been made up of these proteins to allow our immune system to train itself before encountering the real, infectious, pathogen. 

RNA is a nucleic acid molecule which is very similar in concept to DNA, in that it carries coded information. RNA is different from DNA in a lot of ways, though, and the foremost of which is that DNA is ""permanent"" and RNA is ""temporary"". That's a real simple explanation but it will suffice here. 

RNA gives coded instructions to your cellular machinery to produce all sorts of proteins. The RNA in these vaccines has coded instructions to produce the viral proteins of sars-cov-2 (covid-19). When put into your body, your cellular machinery produces these viral proteins which allows your immune system to train itself against covid-19. Since RNA is more temporary, there is no lasting effect on your DNA, RNA, or anything really except for the enhanced protection against the viral proteins that were encoded/produced. 

There's obviously a lot more to it than that, but that's the gist.",jurzle,2020-11-15 19:56:31
"Let's make it really simple:

DNA is transcribed into RNA which is then translated into proteins.

These mRNA vaccines get your cells to make a limited amount of proteins that will trigger an immune response.  They have no way of replicating themselves or altering your DNA.


Slightly more complex: DNA is inside the nucleus of every cell, and it codes for every single protein your cells (and thus you) need.  Think of each segment that codes for a specific protein as one sentence.  You can only copy from the original DNA sentence.  The mRNA is that same sentence but in a language that the ribosomes can understand, so they can build the protein.  Once the protein is built, the mRNA degrades.  It is a different language than the DNA and has no way to alter it even if it managed to interact with it.",jurzle,2020-11-16 03:00:27

In terms of side effects, all the trials involving COVID vaccines will be actively monitoring for side effects, both in the short and in the long term. I expect we'll be doing that for quite a long time. However, when it comes to a global pandemic that's killing millions, we also need to consider the possible benefits of releasing a vaccine (especially with the 90-95% efficacy that's being reported of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines), at least to the most vulnerable populations.",jurzle,2020-11-17 19:03:02

"I have a feeling nobody is going to want to put the effort in for you to gather the information, but if you just google her points, there are plenty of sites debunking them.
For example the Bill Gates thing.  I think what he actually said was that bringing quality health care to third world countries always reduces how many kids people have because they don't need an army of grown kids to take care of them when they are old, so they don't have as many kids.  Thus reducing the end population, which is a problem.
He's right.  It always works out that way.  When poor countries improve, and get health care, people stop having so many kids.  It's a thing.  

Has nothing to do with releasing a vaccine to kill people.

Also the ""tracking chip"" thing with vaccines isn't IN the vaccine.  It's in the packaging.  To track where the vaccine goes and who gets it.  To better track what areas need it etc.  
It doesn't get implanted.  It's just a way to track the bottle to the end recipient.
Also, the are an RFID chip.  Which doesn't have a power source built in.  You have to hold a varying magnetic field near them to ""power"" them and read what's in them.
There's simply no way to make a radio that's always transmitting that's that small.
Antennas have to be at least 1/4 the length of the waves of the radio frequency they use.  For example 1800 MHz commonly used in cell phones require at LEAST a 2.5"" antenna.  
And that's not even getting into how would you power an always transmitting tiny radio?  It'd have to be like, smaller than a grain of sand.
It's ridiculous.
EDIT:   Here's what the RFID built into the vaccine looks like.  See all the coils?  That's the part that makes it run when you hold a varying magnetic field (an RFID reader) up to it to view what's stored in it.  Obviously that whole contraption isn't going into your arm.

> Cons - 3 shots -painful - will cause me massive anxiety

Anxiety sucks.  Talk to your doctor about it and explain *how bad* your anxiety is.  If it's something that's serious to this extent for you they can work with you. I don't know what they'll do, but they'll work with you.

I know doctors can be intimidating, but that intimidation is not *them*, it's *the situation*.  They're people, and they **want** you to feel comfortable around them, because your comfort is going to make you a better patient and them a better doctor.  

For a minute forget you have anxiety or you were talking to a stranger without anxiety... what would you recommend?  

> Other note worthy info I’m not sexually active and while my plans could change and I’m not dead set as of now I am planning on waiting til marriage.

People make decisions they swore that they wouldn't and that they later regret.  People are made to do things they don't want to do.  People marry people with pasts that they didn't expect or understand, or people who made mistakes, or people who were made to do things against their will. 

It's *possible* the person you're marrying will have a virus that causes cancer and not know it, by no action that you would ascribe fault to.  Would you want them to carry around the responsibility of infecting you with this?",jqor1h,2020-11-09 03:11:56

You'll have to have any IUDs removed to prevent spread (ouch), and depending on the severity, you may have to apply medication that *burns off the warts*. Sometimes, extended treatment may be necessary. 

I've had flu shots that were worse than the gardasil shots, and I've also had to drive a friend home because she had to use a cream that effectively burned off the warts and her painkillers wore off in the middle of our class, and she was *not* in any shape to drive.

I don't want to scare you one way or the other, but life is a rich tapestry and anything can happen.  I find my own anxiety is calmed down when I know I've done everything possible to prevent a problem from occurring. I'm 25 now and honestly, I barely remember getting the shots. Someday it'll fade into memory like most other shots.",jqor1h,2020-11-09 03:43:23
"I highly recommend getting the shots. HPV is so easily spread because there is no test for men and they usually don't have symptoms. If you have HPV the things you will have to go through are far more painful than the shots. For example... A colposcopy is insanely painful (IMO) and takes much longer then a shot. And you have to go through more than one of those. 

Anxiety is not fun to deal with but if you can overcome it you'll be making a great choice to protect yourself!

Good luck!",jqor1h,2020-11-09 04:29:28

I got them when I was a teenager.  They weren’t bad!  I would definitely say get them.

"I'm a cervical cancer survivor from a strain that was not covered by the original gardasil but is now covered under Gardasil 9 (the current one). I got it from my first partner, we both got tested before becoming sexually active but HPV is not on most STD tests. Also remember that not all sex is consensual and 50% of marriages end in divorce so just having one partner isn't a guarantee you wont get it. HPV is EXTREMELY common - pre-vaccine around 85-90% of sexually active adults were infected with one or more strains or had been infected in the past.  


I had to undergo radiation, multiple surgeries, cutting, freezing, and burning with a laser. My cervix looks like a battleground and the damage to it from both the cancer and the treatment means I may have a hard time carrying a child to term. The vaccine prevents the 7 strains that account for 90% of all cervical cancer cases and similar proportions with other cancers like oral, anal, penile, and throat. It's a life-saving vaccine I will get my child (if I can have one) the day they are eligible.  


I won't lie to you, the shots (particularly the second) are more painful than the average vaccine, but IT PREVENTS CANCER in both you and your future partners. I'm a huge proponent of this vaccine.",jqor1h,2020-11-22 21:02:12

"Yes, they have to ask you every time you go in, even if you don’t want one. 
When you say, “it’s on all my medical records”, I’m assuming there is a medical reason you are unable to get the flu vaccine? 
I worked as a medical assistant for five years at an internal medicine/pediatric office (I’m in nursing school now), and even though we knew the patient coming in will refuse a vaccine, for example the flu vaccine, we still have to ask and have them sign a waiver stating they refused the vaccine. It’s the same for any recommended vaccine. This is because it is the standard of care and it is irresponsible if a doctor doesn’t abide by this along with unethical if they give misleading information, such as “you likely won’t die from the flu virus”, as this is not true.",jkm8ou,2020-10-30 01:40:04

Your child won’t be fully vaccinated til 2 years old. So every hangout could risk your child measles or whooping cough or chickenpox until you get those shots. Even while pregnant I haven’t seen my unvaccinated nieces and nephews because of the risk they pose to my fetus. You can pick your battles and see if there’s no cases rising of any virus and visit but I chose to just listen to my dr and what they do with their kids and not see unvaccinated people until my child is fully vaccinated at age 2. Your child can only get vaccines at certain ages and then it takes time for the immunity to build because it’s not over night.

My friend has gotten chickenpox 3 times once after the recieving the vaccine. She still has no immunity to chickenpox. She just doesn't create one for whatever reason. That's how even though she vaccinated those who are insisted are a risk to her.,jjoqmm,2020-10-29 00:12:05
"It takes time to receive all the necessary vaccinations, so babies and young children are vulnerable and at the mercy of those surrounding them.

My health was irrevocably damaged by a deliberately unvaccinated older kid when I was 10 months old, too young yet to be vaccinated. My older brother's friend who lived next door came over when he was supposed to be napping to show off toys he'd been given to cope with having chickenpox. He was entirely innocent, picking me up and letting me play with his toys, while he had pox marks on his arms. The varicella virus was brutal to me, causing sepsis that destroyed my endocrine system and was savage to my stomach. As a consequence my immune system didn't develop properly, which put me at risk for other vaccine-preventable diseases. I had pertussis in middle school that was torturous. I also has shingles, caused by chickenpox. 

The varicella / chickenpox vaccine had been available and proven to be safe and effective for years at that point. The boy's parents had the ""my body, my choice"" mentality even though it was his body that got infected and infected mine, and my parents and I had no choice about it. 

I don't trust the judgment of anti-vaxxers. It's often impossible to protect your children from theirs but if you know that an older child hasn't been vaccinated I would use extreme caution. All that it takes is one exposure that can change the entire course of your child's life.",jjoqmm,2020-10-30 03:32:38
"Indeed. Some people's immune system - even those with perfectly adequate immune systems - just don't react to the vaccine, so they haven't been fully immunised. 

If you look at the clinical trial data for vaccines and focus on the trial participants that seroconverted you'll rarely see rates of 100%. Each participant that did not react in the expected way will have done so for some rather complex and individual reasons, but it goes to show that just because you've been vaccinated it doesn't mean you're indestructible.

But the most important reason for encouraging others to vaccinate their kids (or themselves) is that some people in society cannot be vaccinated. Those people rely on other people reducing their risk of infection via vaccination so that they can be relatively confident that they're not going to be struck-down by a horrible disease whilst they're being treated with chemotherapy, or for any other reason why someone is immunosuppressed.",jjoqmm,2020-10-28 16:24:41

"So vaccines are pretty unique in medicine because they’re given to *healthy* people. To ethically administer a vaccine, you have to make sure its possible adverse effects don’t cause more harm to the population than the virus would. This requires testing to make sure it’s very safe and somewhat effective.

"The shortest possible answer is safety testing and regulatory checkpoints.

Under normal circumstances, a concept to delivery vaccine takes around 13 years to progress through the first 3 phases of trials which are necessary to get a drug/compound/vaccine to market, where phase 4 is conducted whilst it’s being rolled out. 

Even with a massive conglomerate of multinationals and many corporations and universities, we are simply not willing to push a vaccine past these checkpoints unnecessarily. Now we can push the trials, but all the data needs to be there so we are actually already in phase 3 at this stage for a number of the vaccine candidates.

The COVID vaccine is progressing the fastest of any vaccine ever, with estimates of <2yrs to market. This is due to two factors: 1. The huge economic distribution caused by the virus incentivises the investment of lots of resources in vaccine development, and 2.

"I checked all the top comments and no one answered your question.

Here is the real answer:

**Clinical trials are highly regulated and very time consuming.**

To prove something is a vaccine, is safe, and effective, is a very long and laborious process. It requires a lot of documentation, checks, and time.

Think about what you'd need to be convinced that a rocket ship is safe, before putting yourself in there, without fear of an explosion; that's the level of rigor vaccines are tested at; all of which is documented in the TMF, Trial masters file, which is locked and analyzed by regulatory authorities.

Even when everything is done, it takes time for the FDA, EMEA, and other organizations to actually read through your trial and know what happened.

Given all of that, people expect a vaccine in under a year. If people knew the amount of paperwork that needed to be generated, tests that are run, and subjects that are enrolled, they would know a year is impossible for vaccine generation.

After all of this, once the vaccine is approved, there is a herculean effort to generate 5-6 billion doses to be able to satisfy world demand; that logistical nightmare and manufacturing prowess also takes many many months to scale up, validate, and roll out.

THEN after that, you need to physically have workers crank out the vials... again in a systemic controlled way. Lots would be randomly tested to ensure efficacy and quality.

So in my mind, if we have a vaccine before middle of 2021, that would be an impressive, near miracle feat. My timeline for generation of a vaccine was mid 2023; when the average person would have a dose in hand and anything before that to me is extremely impressive.",jhfcf6,2020-10-25 21:01:13

There is no harm in getting an MMR vaccine if you have had mumps and rubella and you need the measles coverage. In fact, you will likely need two doses of MMR, as that it is the recommended schedule for protection.",jcxf7w,2020-10-29 00:57:00
"Yes! Have you had the chicken pox too? If not try to get the MMR-Var vaccine. It’s totally worth it to be protected against measles. If you don’t need the mumps and rubella, the dose would just be a complementary dose or a booster. Good luck!",jcxf7w,2020-10-21 05:30:21

"DTP/aP is diphtheria and whooping cough series and it’s done. Hep B is HBV and you have all three. You have all of your kiddy shots for mumps, measles, rubella, and polio. Varicella I believe is chicken pox vaccine and your missing the second shot so I’d ask your doctor about if. Especially if you haven’t had the pox. Double check for tetanus shots because I don’t see anything newer the 2004 and tetanus shots are a every ten year shot. You might get your HPV shots if you haven’t aged out and maybe make sure you get a flu shot.

You are missing some that are on today's schedule, but keep in mind that Prevnar wasn't added until 2000 (but only for kids under age 5 years), the hepatitis A vaccine until 2006, and HPV, and the meningococcal vaccines until even later. 

Assuming you are now 30, you could get the hepatitis A and HPV vaccines if you wanted, although neither is officially routinely recommended at this age.

Tdap is the newer version of Td and since you are due for a booster anyway (every 10 years), you should likely get a Tdap vaccine now.

"When mine was born, my cousin (vaccine-hesitant) wanted to visit with her daughters because they happened to be in town. None of them had had a flu shot.  

I refused.  I was read the riot act.  I shut it down with: “You know I’m a pediatrician and you know my stance on this issue.  Do you *honestly believe* I’m going to budge on keeping my newborn son safe?”

In the end, your sister made a choice.  The thing that always stuns me about antivaxxers is that they want their “freedom” to make their choice, but they’re almost never willing to accept the consequences, such as their children being excluded from school/sports/social functions.

She has the right to make that decision for her daughter, but not for your newborn.",j9gbtn,2020-10-12 02:43:12

"Yes, there is every reason to be concerned, especially in that first year or so (by 1, your child will be vaccinated against those another child is most likely to pass along, assuming you follow the schedule.) Unvaccinated children are up to 35x more likely to be diagnosed with a VPD. As we see with COVID, illnesses can be transmissible before symptoms present. A common trope in the AV crowd is ""you can't pass on what you don't have!"" but you CAN pass on something you don't KNOW you have. And in the first year, the illnesses we vaccinate for are incredibly dangerous--they aren't fun for anyone, but are downright terrifying in infants. Rotavirus can have an infant so dehydrated they need hospitalization--within hours of the first symptom. Older doctors will tell you prior to the vaccine, pediatric wards were lined with HiB cases--now there are very few, thanks to vaccines.   


The conversation, I understand, isn't easy to have--but in that first year, avoiding unvaccinated children is likely for the best. Can I hazard a guess that they're anti-mask too?",j9gbtn,2020-10-12 01:02:48
"First off with COVID you have a great excuse to avoid contact for a good long while so that helps. Interacting with an unvaccinated toddler before your child is fully vaccinated does have some risks. First and foremost would be whopping cough. It kills infants and is very contagious. After that mealses can be quite serious. If it was me, I would wait for my child to receive a full schedule of the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine and the first round of mealses before any visits. So about a year or so. Once kid is fully vaccinated I, personally would not worry too much as long as visits are happening when everyone is healthy.",j9gbtn,2020-10-12 01:36:23
"We had a similar situation with our daughter when she was born - a friend of my wife had not vaccinated their son.

The solution to us was simple: they were told they were unable to visit us until our daughter had completed her vaccination course. No further discussion was needed.

"When I was a child there was no common vaccinations  for Measles in the UK. We caught it and while my sister and I were very ill, my brother developed pneumonia and almost died. 

Roll forward a few years and I qualified as a Paramedic. We got a call to a baby not breathing. This happened in 1986, and you will see the events are still very vivid today. When I went into the room, I noticed things like the blue and yellow cot and the Peter Rabbit mobile hanging over it. I remember the babygro which was white and also had Peter Rabbit on it. There was a yellow stain where the little boy had vomited and the same vomit was on his sheets. He was pulseless and not breathing.

Intubating an infant is hard but I got a tube into him and we tried really hard to get a response but I felt we needed a full paediatric resuscitation team so we scooped and ran. The boys mum was with us and I worked on him all the way to the hospital. The pre-alert had a full team on standby when we arrived and we worked for another 40 minutes in the resuscitation room but the consultant called it.

I can still remember the screams from the boys mum when she was told her son was gone. It is an animal sound of utter desolation and anguish and that has lived with me since 1986. There was a post mortem and an inquest where I was called to give evidence. It was a difficult day but at the end of it we knew why the little boy does and his mother came and hugged me and thanked me. That is a treasured memory.

The cause of death was encephalitis which was a result of Measles.

So in short, yes, there is a very real risk from an unvaccinated child. The mitigation is that there are still people out there who do vaccinate their kids and that does introduce herd immunity. Personally, I would ask them to stay away until your newborn had had their vaccinations completed.",j9gbtn,2020-11-12 11:06:09

I'd let then play together so long as my child was vaccinated with at least the usual set:

"One thing you can consider, if visits are extremely important and depending on your comfort level with risk, is to monitor vaccine preventable illness in your community. If there are no active measles cases, low whopping cough etc you could have a socially distanced visit. If your friends are also strictly following self isolating, masking and social distance protocols then chances are lower the toddler might have an illness to pass on. I am assuming the toddler is not in daycare. The great thing with infants is that they just want to be held by you so it is easy to keep the kids apart.

I had another guy I know that had a bit of a headache and was dizzy for the afternoon: but considering that rabies is the deadliest virus known, the vaccine is the obvious choice.

I finally started to face my fear of needles a few years ago with a flu shot after avoiding vaccines for most of my adult life (already had all of my childhood vaccines) and I just caught up on tetanus booster after being 10 years overdue.  I learned to not fear the needle by deciding to look at the needle... and then I realized looking away from the needle as a child all those years ago just made it more painful due to the anxiety.  Yesterday I just got my flu shot (don’t want to risk fighting both Covid and the flu at the same time), watched the needle go in and I didn’t even feel a thing... until today now that my arm is a bit sore at the injection site.

I’d never had a flu shot in my life so agreeing to that took a lot of internal convincing. I don’t know I could look at them I think I’d be running for cover somewhere, but I’m glad it worked for you! I have to go back and get two more boosters for the hpv shot and I don’t think I’ll lose sleep over it this time but I also don’t think my fear is completely cured.

"The nurse will ask you to sit down and relax. She'll ask you to let your arm go limp, that way it's easy for her to inject the vaccine. She might also ask you to not forget to keep breathing :-) The injection itself will only take a second. How much discomfort it causes depends on the vaccine, the injected volume and the place of the injection. You'll have a sore spot on your arm for a couple of days.

"Recently when I finally started getting flu vaccines in the last 3 seasons I decided to look at the needle and now my anxiety around needles is much much less.  My most recent flu shot yesterday didn’t even hurt... maybe since I was a lot more relaxed this time and let my muscle be relaxed.

About a month ago I got a Td shot which stung a bit... maybe my immune system has a bigger inflammation response to the bacteria that causes diphtheria and tetanus vs the influenza virus.  It also left a hardened lump at the injection site which seems to be someone of a common reaction. The painless lump finally went away after a month which prompted me to get a flu shot yesterday.  I tend to not want too get stuck with too many needles in the same day so I space them out but that’s just me.",j7jiah,2020-10-10 20:18:15

"Your mother's fear of Gardasil is her own anxieties speaking up. She saw something online, got scared, and lacks the means to find better, more trustworthy information to calm her worries.

Gardasil is safe. There are numerous studies on it, and they all conclude that it's very effectice and has very mild side effects (most side effects are the 'standard' vaccination side effects, such as sore or itchy arm at the site of injection, and headache / mild fever as your immune system reacts to build immunity).

I'm a few years too old to get Gardasil covered by the national vaccination program in my country, so I had to take initiative myself to get it, and also pay full price out of my own pocket. In order to argue with my doctor (he was sceptical of its efficiency due to my age, which was already close to the recommended upper limit at the time, and me already being sexually active) I actually *did* some digging and read a bunch of the main scientific publications on the vaccine. (I'm doing a PhD in chemistry so I actually know how to find, read, and judge articles like that.)

It sounds like your mother is worried about the same thing here - the fact that your growing up And they just aren’t ready to help you through that yet and want to hold the process back a little while longer.

"5-in-1? You sure it's not hexavalent aka 6 in 1? Hexacima/hexaxim/infanrix are usually given at that age. Unless you get the Hep B vaccine separately.

We've had this problem too over the years, with syncopes within the vaccines stock. Luckily it's fine if you get it later, as long as it doesn't go over the age of 12 months. Afterwards, you might need to vaccinate the child again with all 3 primary doses.

"This vaccine has been given to hundreds of thousands of kids in England, Wales and Scotland (and NI?) over the last few years and it has an excellent safety record.

Talk to your doctor if you have any questions, they ought to be willing to listen to you. But from my perspective, as someone who studied the UK influenza vaccination programme for my PhD and now studies the safety and efficacy of vaccines to make recommendations in France, you should definitely vaccinate your 2 year old (unless your doctor has any reservations).

Or to put it another way, if my daughter was recommended the vaccine then I'd be first in line with her. We don't have the nasal vaccine in France but I've already asked our pharmacist when they can give my daughter the injection.

Remember, vaccinating your child isn't just reducing the risk of them getting flu, it's reducing the risk of everyone else around them getting flu. Unlike COVID-19 which doesn't seem to spread widely in kids, flu loves kids. But flu particularly loves kids who're in contact with vulnerable adults, hence why it's recommended that kids get vaccinated - you're helping to form a protective bubble around other more vulnerable people.

Do they not understand how vaccines work and so don’t believe in how vaccines have worked to eradicate diseases (e.g. smallpox) or have some basic understanding and seem to believe in misinformation out there about adverse effects? In some cases ppl have strong anti big pharma, govt stance or are into naturopathy (or the likes) which colors their POV on evidence-based medicine. In my experience, always best to gauge where they may be at and offer to share resources, leave an open ended conversation so they can come back to talk. Any sort of hard debates rarely yield ppl to change.

    Aug 2020: Yellow Fever (cheapest place was CHR St Pierre Travel Clinic)
    Sept 2020: PPSV23 Vaccine

I used to travel lots until March this year...

I have some boosters every few years now for the Rabies, Typhoid, DTaP,  and 10 year boosters for Yellow Fever and PPSV23. Probably also need boosters for the meningitis vaccines.

Strangely I have never had a seasonal flu shot.  I think have had the flu twice in my life. And I mean the *flu*, not the common cold that people in Belgium all call la Gripe :)

**All vaccines I had listed above had zero side effects**.  I did *not* feel sick at all. However a few vaccine shots gave me a sore arm for a few days.",iymvos,2020-09-24 10:15:29
"I had never had the flu and had never gotten the flu shot. Last year was the first time I ever got one. My arm wasn't sore and I didn't get sick. I got a flu shot again this year. Same thing, arm wasn't sore and didn't get sick. I think it just affects people differently.",iymvos,2020-09-24 16:02:18
"Hey, congrats on the pregnancy.",iymvos,2020-09-24 10:23:08
Didn't rabipur even give you a small 'pimple' on the injection site for one or two weeks?,iymvos,2020-09-24 10:34:13
Thank you 😊,iymvos,2020-09-25 07:05:08
"nope.  I had this three times and nothing. 

Did you confuse Rabipur with the BCG?  I have a scar from the BCG.

Most countries have a current BCG vaccination programme except most of the EU, AU, NZ, UK ( US and CA never did )",iymvos,2020-09-24 10:48:48
"No, I had the rabies vaccination with Rabipur two weeks ago. First a red spot formed on the injection site, days later it turned into a 'pimple', a bit like an insect bite. The nurse had explained this was likely to happen.

I had them injected intra-dermal, may be yours were intra-muscular and that explains the difference?",iymvos,2020-09-24 11:16:16
"I don't recall. Maybe my doctor made a mistake... 

I'll  grab a titre test for the vaccines later this year.",iymvos,2020-09-24 12:14:05
"It can be administered both ways. Intradermal injection takes only 0,1 ml per shot and intramuscular takes 1,0 ml per shot. Intramuscular seems to be the norm. Intradermal is cheaper, but takes more skill to administer correctly (is what the website of our national department of health says).",iymvos,2020-09-24 13:29:35

"I would definitely get it this season, particularly because of how some symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with the flu, so it’s recommended that you get the flu shot to ensure that if you somehow (hopefully not) contract COVID-19, it’ll be easier to determine which of the two it is before going in to get tested (and you know - potentially infecting others).

As for the flu shot response, because the strains are different each year and more recently they’ve been combining multiple shots in one, it’s normal to experience some pain/side effects, but also know it’s different person to person (you might get light headed while others are fine depending on the shot). Considering that the shots have weakened/inactivated form of the virus, it’s not uncommon for individuals to “get the flu” after the flu shot but usually it’s a milder case and simply because your body is preparing antibodies, so as for your family getting the flu after the shot, it was probably a mild case of it and your family’s bodies were learning to fight the virus. You just may have been less susceptible. 

I would recommend getting the flu shot, and at my previous job at the pharmacy, pharmacists usually recommend sitting in the waiting area for 10-15 minutes (or car if you’re more comfortable with that because of COVID) before leaving just so you can gauge your reaction. Make sure to eat well and hydrate before as well especially if you’re nervous about experiencing dizziness again.",iybavb,2020-09-23 15:45:56
"\>I can take shots and needles like a champ but the flu shot made me feel instantly ill. I almost passed out. I couldn’t stand up straight. My head was spinning.

there is no medical explanation for this. To be clear -- you got a shot in your arm. The vaccine entered your muscle tissue.

Your muscle doesn't speak directly to your brain. Certainly not ""instantly"" --- Thats not how your body works. 

The shot did not cause this. I'm not saying it didnt happen, the brain is very powerful at creating its own reality --- what I'm saying is ... what happened had 100% to do with your anxiety/nervousness/placebo and zero to do with the actual shot.",iybavb,2020-09-24 02:28:45
Okay thanks for your great response. I’ve been really going back and forth on it but you’re right. Flu alone hasn’t been enough to convince me to get it again but flu+ COVID is another story. Again thanks for taking the time to respond.,iybavb,2020-09-23 15:51:07

But you know what hurts worse than a flu shot? The fucking flu. I’d rather have 20 flu shots than the full body ache ass beating that the flu can give you for a week. Also, it usually does work. 

As far as the Covid vaccine...I already got it. I’m in the Pfizer phase three trial. It was two injections. Both caused a bit more pain than the flu shot for about 24 hours post injection. I also got a very mild headache after the second shot. The headache and the soreness from the injections were completely bearable and didn’t necessitate over the counter pain meds. I’d do it again.

"If the Covid vaccine passes all testing, I will be getting it, although I am a bit afraid. I feel better with all the vaccines that have been around longer, so I see there’s a larger risk with a new vaccine. However, there’s also a risk with not getting it, not just because you might or might not survive Covid but because of all the long term effects they have been seeing with people who recovered from Covid.

The chicken pox vaccination has apparently dramatically reduced cases of chicken pox in children, but increased cases of shingles in adults. This is because those adults aren’t coming into contact with chicken pox any more, which would promote more antibodies in their system. In theory, the next generations of adults won’t have this issue because they never had chicken pox in the first place.",isf3ra,2020-09-14 23:19:27

"Based on the evidence that the vaccination doesn’t seem to provide lifelong immunity, and that booster shots may be required, I don’t think there’s enough of the live virus to cause an outbreak in most people. If they do catch chickenpox from the vaccination, it’d surely happen within days of receiving it, not years.

When our daughter got her rotovirus vaccination, we were advised to practice good hygiene and hand washing for the following days, as it was a live virus. I imagine the same advice applies to the chickenpox vaccination.",isf3ra,2020-09-15 09:02:34

"Hi - thank you for responding! I think I was looking at a mix. 

So for example, I will list out the different vaccines in phase III and then under that explain what the vaccine is in one line and give the latest update. 

Something like this - 

1. The Oxford/AZ vaccine  
What is the vaccine?  
The vaccine is a replication-defective viral vector that introduces the body to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. For more on this vaccine, check out our post [here](https://thesharedmicroscope.wordpress.com/2020/07/03/could-the-oxford-university-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-end-the-pandemic/).  
Latest Update:  
The vaccine has been in Phase III clinical trials in the UK and Brazil since \[insert month\]. In August 2020, Phase III clinical trials began in the US.   
Earlier this week, the study was put on hold due to a serious adverse effect in one of the participants. This was first reported by Stat, and more information on the adverse effect can be found [here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/).   

2. Moderna Vaccine  
What is the vaccine? \[Insert 1-2 sentences on the vaccine and link to previous vaccine post\]  
Latest Update:   
\[Insert the latest update - whatever it is\]

I was hoping to add into this newsletter the different drugs being studied too - but that list is massive. I only yesterday counted out almost 37 drugs in Phase III/IV trials... all for COVID-19 and these drug trials are slightly different to the vaccines because they're all mostly repurposed drugs... 

Nevertheless, I think the drugs cannot be ignored until we have a safe and effective vaccine that can be distributed worldwide + we also have higher anti-vax sentiments! So I may have to alternate weeks of drug updates and vaccine updates? I'm still unsure because it's a lot of work lol :3

What do you think of the idea?",iq1orl,2020-09-10 15:55:14
"Interesting. I think the drugs will still be helpful after a vaccine too as RNA virus vaccines tend to have a lower effectiveness & shorter effective period than DNA virus vaccines. I think the vaccine will reduce it enough we can go back to more or less ordinary life but at this point, I'm thinking it's unlikely we'll completely defeat covid any time soon (it might be 1-5% what it has been this year in the best case which isn't a pandemic but is a disease to look at drug treatments for).",iq1orl,2020-09-10 16:01:48
"I agree - we would need a mix of both. And although I see LOADS of talk of the vaccines, there's nearly not enough on the drugs! The last I heard of drug trials was the RECOVERY study in the UK, but even then, information is sparse.

Do you have any thoughts on the top drugs I should focus on? I do try to simplify the science behind the drugs and the vaccines to try to tackle misinformation; so I would be doing that too on the side with the newsletters (and also to create backlinks).

"Additional groups were added to the recommendations over time...kids, over 65, over 50, high risk individuals (including those who are immunocompromised), healthcare providers. By the 2009-10 season, the recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccination included ~85% of the US population. (See quote pasted below.)

From the 2009 recommendation publication:
""Influenza vaccine should be provided to all persons who want to reduce the risk for becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting it to others. However, emphasis on providing routine vaccination annually to certain groups at higher risk for influenza infection or complications is advised, including all children aged 6 months--18 years, all persons aged ≥50 years, and other adults at risk for medical complications from influenza. In addition, all persons who live with or care for persons at high risk for influenza-related complications, including contacts of children aged <6 months, should receive influenza vaccine annually (Boxes 1 and 2). Approximately 85% of the U.S. population is included in one or more of these target groups; however, <40% of the U.S. population received an influenza vaccination during the 2008--09 influenza season.""
See: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5808a1.htm
 
In 2010, the recommendation was updated to include all individuals (not contraindicated) 6mo and older, which is the same as it is today. Updates to the recommendations are published annually and include guidance on specific vaccine classes (e.g. influenza vaccines specifically for those 65 and older). 

If you want to dig through the specifics, the full historical recommendations can be found here: 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html",ipp3iv,2020-09-09 22:59:02
"I think it's been at least 20 years. I'm basing that on the fact that I remember the house I lived in when I last had flu, and started getting the flu shot the year after that. Before that, I remember telling my doctor that, no, I didn't need a flu shot.",ipp3iv,2020-09-09 23:07:04
"I don’t remember ever having it offered as a child, I’m 30. College was the first time I ever think I even knew anyone who got it. I’ve still never had one- haven’t been to a doctor when it would be offered",ipp3iv,2020-09-10 21:13:30
"A little more info on why 2009 - that was a pandemic year ( although a little more calm than this one ) and the swine flu that year hit kids hard 
 The cdc.gov website estimates that 80% of the flu death that year were in people under 65 which is atypical. So recommendations were updated. 

CDC is a good rabbit hole to go down if you want to understand more about influenza ( or a lot of other diseases )",ipp3iv,2020-09-09 23:41:50
Thanks for clarifying. I had wondered as I was not used to doing it then ~8 years ago a job I had asked me to get it so I did. I guess I got it a little after recommend for all but have gotten it annually since then.,ipp3iv,2020-09-10 04:50:45
and you still get the flu??,ipp3iv,2020-09-10 00:51:46

"In the US, following the Affordable Care Act, all insurance MUST cover recommended vaccines.",ipw0ug,2020-09-10 14:21:35
This is just at the doctor. Some insurance does not cover   pharmacy flu shots.,ipw0ug,2020-09-10 16:31:23
"Some people are completely uninsured or have something similar to insurance that covers them but doesn't cover vaccines.

I'm on what's technically called ""health sharing"" which works a lot like insurance except everything below a certain amount, including a vaccine, is out of pocket, but the monthly bill is lower by more than the extra I need to pay for stuff like this & I find it less expensive per year than insurance. I'm not alone as although not nearly as popular as insurance, these plans cover about 1 million Americans. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_sharing_ministry",ipw0ug,2020-09-10 14:34:11
Is there any difference between getting it at a doctor or a pharmacy?,ipw0ug,2020-09-10 21:11:06
"No it is the same shot. It just seems all insurance pays at the doctor but some don't pay at the pharmacy. Obviously, you can get your local pharmacy to check next time in their store.",ipw0ug,2020-09-10 22:06:14
"If I opt to get it I would probably do it at my doctor anyway, I was really just curious as to if there was any difference.",ipw0ug,2020-09-10 23:09:15
"The only thing can be then you might have to pay the copay for the doctor. For a few years I had my annual physical in September or October to make this easy but now that would be another trip to the doctor.

Most major pharmacies do take most insurance, but that double most means you may have to check.

Honestly even if we don't go single payer, making vaccines free to everyone wherever is a good idea because you often take them for others more than yourself. I mean a flu would be unpleasant for me, but I am worried about those out would be deadly for.",ipw0ug,2020-09-11 02:38:50

"rushing a vaccine is idiotic.
We should make 110% sure that the vaccine is safe and effective.
Now my question is how will we make sure it is safe without longterm studies??",ioucss,2020-09-08 15:35:50
"I wish we of her a vaccine quicker, but I also think safety is important. I wonder if this will have any effect on those who are saying ""no"" to a covid vaccine because they think the vaccine was rushed so not safety tested?",ioucss,2020-09-08 15:19:14
"The current studies are 3-4 months & by that time we will have found the vast majority of negative side effects (like well over 99%). As RNA viruses & vaccines have often not given long term immunity, the real question they can't answer now is whether this vaccine will have a life long effect or whether we'll need a boaster every year or two (similar to the flu vaccine). Related is whether the various covid vaccines will grant equally long immunity or will one be significantly longer lasting. I am totally willing to take a covid vaccine not knowing if I'll need to repeat in 2 years rather than waiting for those studies two years from now.",ioucss,2020-09-08 15:46:57
"We could have, if we had spent 0.1% of every countries budget on virus research, with a global research centre, non profit. All vaccines at cost price/production cost.
Every country having researchers with full acces to all data.

We need that, to eradicate virusses forever.
We really need vaccines and treatments against current virii, and future virusses.",ioucss,2020-09-09 04:05:16
thanks for your insight :) that makes sense.,ioucss,2020-09-08 16:19:10
"Finally a normal discussion about vaccines having side effects, without being anti vax.
I would 100% get the vaccine if its had all the trials completed succesfully.
Although most of the trials are mainly to see if the vaccine provides enough protection, and for a long time.
To see if they need to be done 1x, or 2x with sone days inbetween.
and testing which vaccine works best...
but yeah, safety too.",ioucss,2020-09-09 04:01:27
Even if you were certain it’d only last 2 years...,ioucss,2020-09-10 18:00:25
"Well, wasn't there a story about one being suspended because one person had a serious negative reaction?

Phase III is once they've determined dosage to test ~30,000 double blind half with placebo & half with the vaccine for several months to see lower rates in real life, not just the lab. I can only imagine if 2 or more / ~15,000 getting the vaccine had a negative reaction, that vaccine would be canceled, as such reactions are usually in the range of 1-2 per million in vaccines in use but 2/15,000 is 133 per million. A single case might just be bad luck as if 2 per million have a serious reaction, 15,000 means there's a 3% chance you enroll one of those two per million (the odds of 2 serious reactions are then 3% of 3% or 0.09%, which is rare enough as to be assumed won't happen).",ioucss,2020-09-09 04:14:24
"What are our options?

1. Wait several years for a test of long term effectiveness & be under current covid restrictions tool then. 😕

2. Get a vaccine that has been tested and found to be highly safe overall & highly effective short term & end all covid restrictions. 👍

Option 2 isn't perfect, but it's 100x better than option 1. I don't want to get stuck with covid, but I'd also like to be able to do a lot of things that I can't now due to reasonable risk of covid transmission.",ioucss,2020-09-10 18:12:11
And we can do those long term studies in the meanwhile,ioucss,2020-09-10 18:13:16
"Obviously. I'm certain that companies, the government, etc. would be watching that pretty closely on that as it's an obvious issue & I don't think anyone wants to wait 4 years for a vaccine just to answer that question.",ioucss,2020-09-10 18:17:20
"to clarify:
I am not Anti-Vaxx nor a medical expert.I grew up with an Anti-Vaxx mom and a Pro-Vaxx dad.
Me personally I am in the middle right now.I am definitely not Anti-Vaxx and I think that most “Anti-Vaxxer’s” are ludicrous.
I am just trying to build my own opinion on this subject right now and want to be able to rationalize this topic.As of now I do think that Vaccines are an “Imperfect science”.I think Vaccines are a great Idea but I just have some concerns.
One of my main concerns actually is the [42 U.S. Code § 300aa–22. Standards of responsibility](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300aa-22)
it states that “ No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.”

The problem I see with this is that there is no free market for the Vaccines and that this could create an Incentive for Vaccine Companies to not perfect their Vaccine.

Please Please can some Expert in this field give me some insight on my concerns.I am just a Teenager trying to build my own opinion.
(Also I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes,I am from Germany)",ioq76k,2020-09-08 10:22:29
"So I don’t know if I’m an expert at this but I do work for a vaccine manufacturer. I understand why this looks like an incentive to not make good product but no one I know in our industry ( I’m in the US, work for a multi National pharma company and know many of my colleagues at other companies ) would ever think of putting out less than our best product. But I also understand that many people think large companies are “evil” and out to maximize profits. 

The first thing I will say is that the US National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is that it was  was established after lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and healthcare providers threatened to cause vaccine shortages and reduce vaccination rates.
 
Vaccines are an important part of decreasing childhood mortality and we recognize that mandating childhood vaccines is one way to ensure that you offspring survive to adulthood ( and all the side effects that go along with this - if your children survive you have less children, increases to maternal health etc.)

VICP covers the required childhood vaccines. 
But nothing is perfect and there are some small percentage of people who will have a reaction to a vaccine or a vaccine component.  So in order to ensure an adequate vaccine supply the US gov’t said we will compensate legitimate injuries to ensure that we can protect as many people as possible. You can look up at wiki ( or follow back to source documents probably at hrsa.gov) that the number of injuries are relatively small compared to the number of doses administered. 

Also vaccines are pretty rigorously tested before granted a license. There are multiple clinical trials in multiple age groups and demographics to ensure safety and efficacy. And after a vaccine is licensed data is collected and reviewed for side effects ( VAERS - vaccine adverse event reporting system collects data from people who report side effects from site injection redness to seizure etc)

Additionally every lot of vaccine manufactured has numerous tests to make sure they are safe, pure, identify and efficacious. And after the company tests the lot, data is sent to the FDA and they review/ approve  a lot before it is allowed to be distributed. 

Every pharma facility licensed by the FDA is supposed to undergo an inspection every 2 years to ensure that quality practices are up to expectation ( this is true of all pharma not just vaccines) and if it’s not there are layers of consequences. 

All these things add up to a system that ensures that the mandatory vaccines are as good as they can be given current technology and scientific understanding to protect people but recognizes that everybody is different and sometimes a person and their vaccine are incompatible. 

I hope that helps give you some insight into why VICP exists - it’s not a bad incentive to be lazy it is part of a system to do the most good",ioq76k,2020-09-08 11:37:52

"Takeda has had a Norovirus vaccine in development for several years.  They published a [phase 2 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20307726) back in June amongst adults 60 years and older.  Seroconversion varied from 0% to 54.2% depending upon the strain tested.  

Vaxart finished a [phase 1b](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaxart-oral-norovirus-gi1-and-gii4-vaccine-was-reported-well-tolerated) trial last year.  They are supposed to be starting phase II this year.

The Takeda vaccine would have a hard time getting a recommendation in most developed countries outside of some high risk populations(e.g. infants, senior citizens, etc.) due to the relatively low efficacy rate and the fact that few healthy adults die from the disease in places with good medical care.  The Vaxart vaccine is still pretty early in the process.

There are multiple safety surveillance  systems in place. Antivaxxers like to hold on to VAERS but there is more than just VAERs. There are 3 agencies in the US alone that monitor safety, but each country has its own data base as well. Antivax like to say that there is no studies or monitoring but that is far from the truth.

She says she doesn't know but probably not because she doesn't want us to be injected with something that scientists tried to get done as fast as possible (they have reason to try and do it fast because people are dying every day of covid) and probably wouldn't have been in trial for a long time.** 

That is fair. THis is why operation warp speed is a bad idea. That said phase 3 clinical trials involve thousands and thousands of people. It usually takes a decade for a new vaccine to be available for the population.....because they study safety and efficacy a very long time.

 **She has said that she believes our bodies are strong enough to handle viruses without vaccines.** 

She thinks you can handle diphtheria and tetanus without a vaccine? Unlikely. Also what kind of backward thinking is it, that a baby can handle full on measles, but not the teeny bit of weakened virus in the vaccine. That is insanity. Not to mention SSPE is a risk to wild measles, and it is a slow painful death that takes years.

 **She has said that people vaccinate unnecessarily for alot of things.**

**Chicken pox, for example. When my grandparents were kids and a kid in the neighborhood got chickenpox, they would have chicken pox parties so the other kids would get it as young as possible. You're not going to die from chicken pox. It sucks, yeah, but you don't need vaccines just because something sucks.**

What about other people. Its not always about you. What if you give your pregnant neighbor chicken pox or rubella? Is that fair that her baby now has birth defects? Chicken pox sucks, but shingles is worse and will likely go away with younger generations thanks to the vaccine.

Google congenital rubella. It aint pretty. 

&#x200B;

**People also vaccinate for diseases that are rare to get and they most likely won't get, like polio.**

Hmmm. I wonder why its unlikely to get polio today? Hmmmmm.

"Ok, thanks so much. I appreciate you being willing to explain stuff to me. One of the things that's told in the anti vaxx groups is that the vaccine companies have had to pay out over 4 billion dollars to vaccine injuries and death. If vaccines are mostly safe why have they had to pay out so much especially when it's so hard to prove vaccine injury? Also, why are vaccine manufacturers exempt from liability? If a company isn't ever going to be held responsible for their product causing injury or death then what motivation do they have to make sure their product is safe? These are a few of the arguments I've come across and I've yet to get a good answer to these questions. It's a very confusing a conflicting place to be when you're on the fence. I don't want to put my son at risk of preventable diseases but Im also not sure if the diseases are less risky than the vaccine.",imks89,2020-10-30 00:51:01
"Actually the burden of proof for vaccine court is actually really low. There is even a table of injuries that get automatic compensation. It is possible to sue the vaccine company. It will be harder to win because the burden of proof is higher in civil court. The vaccine court was created to expedite the process, which is why the burden of proof is lower than civil court. There are literally billions of vaccines administered, 4 billion dollars is actually not that much relative to the doses given. Antivaxxers also say that its the taxpayer that pays, but its actually the vaccine companies that have paid that 4 billion.

"Ok, so my next question would be why risk it? If it's known that vaccines cause so many injuries why risk it when the actual diseases aren't as risky once caught? In antivaxx groups they say that catching measles and whooping cough isn't as bad for unvaxxed children because their immune systems aren't tainted and suppressed by vaccines.

"It’s generally not for school safety but rather it’s a good time to catch teenagers and get them vaccinated for HPV. High school is a time when many young people become sexually active so you want to try and get them vaccinated before they start. Obviously you don’t get everyone but high school is the last time you have an opportunity for immunizing some one for all these adult things. Many people don’t go to the doctor for years after the required 12th grade physical ( in the US, can’t speak for any place else). And it’s not the school requiring them it’s the state. 

Also the HPV vaccine isn’t just for people born with cervixes. HPV is found in around half of penile cancers.",imrk9r,2020-09-05 01:42:40
Im going to assume HOV is misspelled and is supposed to be HPV. The hpv vaccine prevents cervical cancer. Even if its not contagious why wouldnt you vaccinate people against it asap,imrk9r,2020-09-05 01:27:39
"I don’t like vaccines being required, I’m not against them but as someone who has suffered with needle fears throughout my life I can say forcing someone only makes them more resistant. Give me the info, explain the benefits, and let me make a decision whether that’s now or on my own time. 

I didn’t get HPV shots in school, first time it was brought up as my pre college physical. I declined, already needing 2 other shots, but now a few years (and an expanded age recommendation) later, I’ve done research and am planning on discussing the shots with my doctor. Years ago I never would have even considered the idea of a non required vaccine.",imrk9r,2020-09-10 16:13:10

"Yes I know but why should it be a school requirement 

And yes I didn’t mean HOV",imrk9r,2020-09-05 01:30:17
"Schools mandate them because the state ( again in the US) says that everybody must have them- if is a state reg then it doesn’t matter if it’s a private or a public school. 

So if you could prevent around 32000 cases annually of HPV and all the associated costs wouldn’t you. By making the vaccine mandatory, hopefully before people are sexually active you prevent
A person from catching a sexually transmitted disease which then has to be treated and follow up visits ( costs, resource utilization, time ) 
That person is prevented from spreading the disease, who then either spreads the disease or gets treated using resources 
Keep multiplying those costs. I saw an article  from NIH ( 2008j that estimates ) the annual cost of HPV infections at 4B USD
Add to that several years down the road that people from above gets cancer and now has to have cancer treatments- again costs but also cancer treatments suck

There are also soft savings of making this mandatory for high school- it is often an opportunity for a pediatrician to open a conversation about s dual activity and it a chance to educate about birth control and sexuality etc. 

So by mandating the HPV vaccine in high school you can hopefully stop one of the most prevalent  STIs before it starts, and save that person years of painful treatments. And at the end of the day the  state and the insurance companies save money.

You can look at it as some humanitarian effort to prevent cancer or you can look at it as a way for insurance companies/ agencies to save money. 

Also consider this - many insurance companies will not cover a vaccine unless it’s mandatory.",imrk9r,2020-09-05 02:07:07

Before the first round your immune system was naive to the antigens in the HPV vaccine so it reacted though this reaction probably induced less inflammation than the actual injection. After that if you experienced this kind of reaction it would indicate a overly productive immune response to the first vaccination. The third injection is to ensure your immune response to the HPV vaccine is robust enough to protect against the pathogen and the cancer it causes. These symptoms you are reporting are normal and indicate that the vaccine is doing what it’s designed to do. You will feel better in a few days.,ikye5t,2020-09-02 10:23:50
Hmm.. have you gotten HPV before the shot?,ikye5t,2020-09-02 06:51:56
"Think of it like a cheat code for your immune system. The vaccine introduces a weak or dead viruses that send your system into a frenzy. The body saves the information so that when the real strong live virus gets in, your body already knows how to fight the virus.

It is healthy because when your body encounters something new, it can take four to seven days to get your bodies on the defense. Oftentimes it’s to late to fight it off well without modern medicine.

If your body already knows what to do, it takes significantly less time to get the bodies defenses going. The sooner your body kills it, the more likely you are to not get sick and spread it to others. That’s why case numbers went down until people wanted to stop vaccinating. Now it is dangerous to take a vaccine if your are allergic or immune compromised.

"Some diseases you can only get once.  You get them, you die or get better, and then you can't get them again.  What vaccines do is give you the disease but without making you sick, or ill or even poorly.  Usually they trick your body into making it so that you can't get it again by basically making you kind of have the disease.  The whole point of a vaccine is to have it be like you had the disease but you didn't.  The first vaccine was for smallpox, and the vaccine was called cowpox and milkmaids got it because they were around cows so much, and then one guy had the idea to give people cowpox because then they couldn't get smallpox, and it worked.",ikvutz,2020-09-02 06:25:30

"> wouldn’t that overload the immune system?

No, there is no evidence to support this.

Plenty of vaccines on the regular schedule are given simultaneously.",ijd3e5,2020-08-30 16:28:18
"I was looking for the same information. 
The most important rule seems to be that simultaneous injections are preferably given in different limbs. If that's not possible, the injection sites should be at least 1 inch apart.

What I was worried about is whether the vaccinations will be as effective when administered simultaneously, compared to separately. According to the [US CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6002a1.htm) it's fine to be administered multiple vaccines at once.

I also found this article though: [Simultaneous vaccination with Prevenarand multicomponent vaccines for children:Interference or no interference?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/hv.5.1.6520). I've no idea if it's a reputable journal and I have difficulties understanding what they're claiming. It's also 11 years old by now, there might be more recent information. I haven't looked any further.

Did you take into account that you'll have to come back twice for the HPV vaccination? It's 3 injections total, at least that's the case where I live. The same for hepatitis B. Hepatitis A needs either 2 or 3.",ijd3e5,2020-08-30 21:30:01

"It's routine for multiple vaccines to be administered. It's safe to do so, and far more time efficient. Instead of returning multiple times to receive a vaccine, you get as many as possible in one visit. This significantly increases the likelihood for receiving all needed vaccinations, whereas having to make multiple appointments and return for each one would be discourage many. I think it also decreases anxiety about needles since you're getting it all done in one go instead of having the dread of repeating the process multiple times.

It won't overwhelm the immune system at all. Babies routinely receive multiple vaccinations at once. When my grandfather was in the Marines they were all lined up, and told to roll up their sleeves on both arms to receive vaccinations. They had a nurse on either side of them administering multiple vaccinations in each arm. Friends in the military today said that's still common.",ijd3e5,2020-08-30 21:53:42

I understand feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of having six shots in one day, but it really is something that I think you can endure if you decide. But if you're really feeling that it's cruel, advocate for yourself. Call the office and say that you wish to book multiple appointments over the next few months to receive all the vaccines by January rather than in one go.

"Hey there, 

If you don’t like needles, have you checked whether your doc or nurse can give you the nasal flu vaccine spray option? Info on that is here: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm

As for whether one should get a flu vaccine during COVID, it is actually more important than ever. You don’t want to accidentally catch the flu, and wonder whether the symptoms are flu or covid related (my sister has pollen allergies and early on when she had shortness of breath and incessant cough, it was really stressful for our family just to ascertain whether she had covid or not...turned out to be just allergies), and frankly you don’t want flu developing into complications (which does happen in some cases) and having to be in facilities you would rather avoid at this time. Finally, my opinion is that viruses are nasty and as much I believe washing hands and social distancing helps, I would rather not take the chance that they can still sneak in! Our family got their flu vaccines and so we have one less thing to worry about!

The flu kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide every year. You're not in a high risk group, but if you catch the flu, you may very well pass it on to someone who is (directly or indirectly).

"Disclaimer- not involved in Covid19 trials or clinical trails in general, just speaking from general knowledge of what you might think about when setting up a trial.

I saw your question about how many people would it take and while I look at data a lot the answer is not not possible unless the CMO asked you to journal what you did and ate, how you slept etc. that number is going to be incredibly high. What they want is a slice of demographics some young, older, old people, Some white, black, Asian, Latino people. Men and women. You want proportions of your population to see if the vaccine if efficacious in all those populations. There are differences in each of those groups that may affect efficacy. ( as an example I know of a product that worked for everybody but worked really well in the Inuit population for some reason). So when you choose your trial size you look at how many people do you need to get enough samples to represent each demographic ( crossed - so you want young white women and older Asian men- pull out factorial and you can see how many different permutations there are)  

And then you expect people to just be people. 

And you are not being a bad trial subject, you are being you and that’s someone who will choose to continue to self isolate and avoid people. Lots of people who get the vaccine are going to do the same thing cause that’s how they feel. Even if I had the vaccine I would continue what I am doing ( WFH, online ordering, limiting trips to store, wearing my mask) regardless because everyone has immunity there is still risk to me and to others. 

The clinical trial protocol can be seen at www.clinicaltrials.gov

Just out of curiosity I saw in their protocol that trial participants have to agree not to impregnate/ get pregnant till 3 months after second dose- did they tell you that out loud? ( I understand why they are doing that, their data is going to be interesting to see how many people complied ) 

“Male participants engaging in activity that could result in pregnancy of sexual partners must agree to practice adequate contraception and refrain from sperm donation from the time of the first dose and through 3 months after the second dose.” ( there several lines for woman on this topic)",iew6u6,2020-08-23 12:09:16

"In stage II, did they have a test where they intentionally exposed people who were vaccinated? I thought of volunteering but I thought it involved intentional exposure & worried that would put some people around me at risk.

BTW, let's say 1% of the US population gets COVID-19 during the study time - this is a rough estimate as there is no way to know for what future rates will be. That means logically ~150 from each cohort of 15,000 would have an exposure that would likely cause covid without vaccination. However, given that the type who volunteer are probably less risky (like you said you're a bad control), let's say 100. At that rate, each of the actually vaccinated people who gets covid subtracts 1% from 100% effectiveness. What will matter is the comparison of the two numbers - that's why they need two equally large groups.",iew6u6,2020-08-24 03:13:31

"So I work for a vaccine manufacturer. I don’t work on my company’s Covid19 vaccine and actually know very little about the project as it’s being worked on in areas outside my expertise. I hope I can give you some info if not all the answers you want and I hope I get all my answers right because I only did quick searches. The info I present is generally available it’s just easier for me to locate sources if needed.

There are primarily two types of vaccines being proposed for Covid19. One is a recombinant protein where they install some virus genetic information into a host system and have a protein expressed that can be used by a person to create antibodies. This is already being used by several vaccines already licensed on a large scale and sold by the big vaccine manufacturer ( in the US this is GSK, Merck and Sanofi generally) - this tech is in use and already proven in millions of people to work and have no long term effects. ( Hep B, Influenze for example )

The other type being proposed is an mRNA vaccine. There is a nice summary article at https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243#citeas. If you are curious. These vaccines have some advantages except right now they do not have a large scale or long term study because I am unaware and couldn’t find any mRNA vaccines that are licensed.  So there is no long term data on the technology that is being proposed. So while promising there is a level of discomfort here. 

Additionally, since the companies making the mRNA vaccines are relatively new, most of them do not have licensed products and thus have not previously been subjected to regulatory inspections or approvals. In the US drug manufacturer are subject to FDA inspections usually every 2 years unless there is cause. So there is a layer of discomfort at the fact that many companies have never been inspected before.
 
Add to that the level of urgency with the Covid19 vaccine and the fears that certain governments will take shortcuts to get a vaccine licensed out there and do something. More discomfort here.

Vaccine clinical trials are usually split into cohorts - pediatric, toddler, adolescents, adult, geriatric - this is one of the reasons it takes so long to license - nobody has infinite resources to run this many clinical trials at once so usually you pick your target audience ( meningitis for adolescents, flu for geriatric) and start there and then expand after you can sell some product. This is a vaccine for literally everyone in the world - what size and diversity is needed to get an accurate trial. And are they getting people to sign up in the right demographics. Little more discomfort here. 

The Russia vaccine I assume causes discomfort because their government seems sketchy, they quickly rushed out a vaccine and they skipped the last most important steps of clinical trials Phase III- large scale clinical.

So there’s a lot of little causes for discomfort that are giving a lot of people angst about taking the Covid19 vaccine. 

On the plus side - every single lot of vaccine is reviewed by the manufacturer, and then reviewed and sometimes tested by the government. So when my company makes a batch of vaccine x- we do our thing ( we make, test, and review all the documentation for that batch) before we package it and then the government of the country where we make it ( for me it’s the FDA) looks at our test results and documentation, we’ve been inspected so they know our facilities and our quality systems and sometimes they choose to test certain / all batches of the lot before we are allowed to ship them out to people. In some cases after the FDA is finished we have to ship some vials/ syringes to a foreign government along with our paperwork and they test as well. 

I know this is long- sorry but I hope that answers some of your questions about why people are saying they won’t take a Covid19 vaccine right now.",iegsk4,2020-08-22 13:10:41
"The thing people are failing to account for in dismissing the vaccine because of the potential for some far out unknown is that they’re not giving the same attention to the unknown long term impact of infection. When these vaccines are approved, the risks will be weighed- short and long term.",iegsk4,2020-08-22 22:41:33
"Great answer. I would agree that a recombinant offering would generally be better understood than an RNA product.

I think most people are thinking this would be a whole inactivated or split virion which in those cases could lead to more ""covid-like"" response and I could see the desire for better understanding of response over a long term.",iegsk4,2020-08-22 14:14:41
"See I would think that if the vaccines making all the news were traditional egg based split virion people would have less angst

Every year companies make a 100M plus doses of traditional flu vaccine and the people who don’t get that vaccine don’t usually give long term effects as a reason for not getting it. 

I think the media keeps talking about the new technologies because I honestly couldn’t say if anyone is trying a traditional vaccine ( my company has an nRNA and a recombinant candidate) and if the vaccine companies would put forth a vaccine “ made just like your flu vaccine”  people would be less wary",iegsk4,2020-08-22 14:26:46
That's a good point. I've really only worked with recombinant so I am biased against proliferating egg based vaccines. I could imagine that there could simply be supply and facility shortages for the eggs needed since I'm assuming you need specific eggs from specific farms for quality purposes,iegsk4,2020-08-22 14:37:46
"I agree - we should be moving away from egg based - and a lot of vaccines have already moved to recombinant. Even for a regular flu season there are a lot of eggs used.  The amount of eggs needed for a 7 billion dose vaccine is enormous
I think the choice of eggs has a lot to do with the ability to propagate virus, consistency of egg size and quality and the ability to maintain a healthy flock that produces consistent numbers
The supply chain security is also a concern. But I suspect that is true for the new vaccines also - I have seen comments about the syringe supply needed. I assume with no info that the new covid vaccines will be multi dosed which is a new challenge - the world has been moving to single dose syringes for safety and economy. In order to vaccinate 7 billion people we are going to have to get the old vaccine “guns” out that do 50 shots in minutes",iegsk4,2020-08-22 14:54:44

85% effective at preventing any form of varicella
almost 100% effective against severe varicella
Two doses

In a pre-licensure clinical trial, 2 doses of vaccine were—
98% effective at preventing any form of varicella
100% effective against severe varicella
In post-licensure studies, 2 doses of vaccine were—
88% to 98% effective at preventing all varicella

And 


A case-control study conducted from 1997 to 2003 showed that 1 dose of varicella vaccine was 97% effective in the first year after vaccination and 86% effective in the second year. From the second to eighth year after vaccination, the vaccine effectiveness remained stable at 81 to 86%. Most vaccinated children who developed varicella during the 8 years after vaccination had mild diseas.",ie4n4i,2020-08-21 23:55:14

"I’ve come back to report my results for future references regarding a single childhood varicella vaccination: 

After receiving a single varicella dose 20 years ago, according to my most recent titer, I still have immunity. According to the results, immunity is considered >165 (135-165 equivocal) with my value showing as 310. This was for the Varicella-Zoster V Ab, IgB test.",ie4n4i,2020-09-01 18:45:14
According to historyofvaccine.org the booster dose was added in 2006. By oldest kid had a similar situation when he went school - he only had one dose and had a titer done to prove he was good to go.,ie4n4i,2020-08-22 01:04:14

From there, medical companies will begin testing new types of vaccines to replace first phase to make them better, ie more effective, life time immunity vs. yearly immunity, deal with allergy problems that may crop up.

Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults ages 27 through 45 years may decide to get the HPV vaccine based on discussion with their clinician, if they did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. HPV vaccination of people in this age range provides less benefit, for several reasons, including that more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV”

Why would you want to? It is best just to get all necessary vaccines done at once.,i7ywnm,2020-08-12 06:43:55

So I take it both are relatively important? When I looked at the cdc info looks like Hep A is recommended if you are traveling outside the country. If I’m not doing that is it necessary? Still on the fence with HPV as I am over 26 and I’m not a fan of the idea of three shots,i7ywnm,2020-08-12 14:12:16
"Yes, both are important. HepA outbreaks happen inside the US, too. And even if you're over 26, HPV is likely to be beneficial -- even if you have already contracted some strains of HPV, you probably haven't contracted all of them. The vaccine will still reduce your risk of cervical cancer.

Obviously you need to weigh up how much the momentary pain of a few injections matters to you versus a very substantial reduction of the risk of cervical cancer, plus the risk of HepA, should you come into contact with contaminated food or water either in the US or overseas. Personally I would say the pain from a few injections is pretty insignifcant compared to the suffering caused by those illnesses.",i7ywnm,2020-08-13 01:42:22

Basically drugs are followed long after they being prescribed, it's important because even with extensive research funky things can rear their head in the greater market.

We've had vaccines for over well 20 years. We know there aren't long term adverse effects.,i49l9l,2020-08-05 19:37:01
"Watch this 5-min video that goes over all the safety monitoring systems that are in place (applies to U.S.)

https://youtu.be/Fcvgp6gNh6o",i49l9l,2020-08-05 20:38:54
"They don't. When a person lives 20-30 years after receiving a vaccine, any number of genetic or environmental effects can contribute to a health issue, making it impossible to pinpoint the cause of a disease to a vaccine received earlier in life. Measuring immediate side effects is possible, but there is no way to ensure long term safety. The same could be true for any kind of medication, radiation, etc.",i49l9l,2020-08-18 20:15:21
"But that’s after a vast amount of people has already been applied the vaccine, so in the case of it having negative long term effects the damage would be done",i49l9l,2020-08-05 19:04:31
Not entirely true. Reinfection (and infection post vaccination) with flaviviruses can lead to antibody enhanced disease. The formalin RSV vaccine lead to severe disease upon RSV infection (vaccine enhanced disease).,i49l9l,2020-08-05 20:08:30
"It's part of the risk/benefit analysis. The likelihood that a vaccine will have adverse effects that only/primarily occur many years after administration is judged to be low enough (and the postmarket studies bear this out), and the benefit high enough, that it's considered an acceptable risk.

If we waited 30 years to see if there's any long term adverse effects, how many people might die or otherwise be negatively affected by the actual disease? 

We know enough about vaccines in general and the specific pathogens that we can make pretty good guesses about how they might affect people. There's no reason to expect adverse effects to ""wait"" to appear for almost all vaccines (with a few notable exceptions like the prospective dengue vaccine which can cause more severe reinfection... dengue is weird). 

The vast, vast majority of adverse reactions are pretty prompt after administration of the vaccine, within minutes or hours or days at the most. 

Further, the longer the safety trial, the more likely a spurious correlation might appear, particularly with small sample sizes. Say for example you notice that 100 of the 120 patients in the cohort that got the vaccine got heart disease within 30 years (let's assume for the sake of the example that this is a vaccine made for adults). In the other cohort, only 60 of the 120 get heart disease. You might think,  wow! That's a huge increase in risk for heart disease. But about 1/3 to 1/2 of people get heart disease (if memory serves, anyway). So you have to do some statistics to see whether the association is actually statistically significant (i.e., likely to be a ""real"" effect and not just happenstance). The longer the trial, the more likely you are to notice something which is actually just a result of chance. 

Postmarket monitoring doesn't have this problem to anywhere near the same degree, because the sample sizes are so vastly larger. It makes it much easier to detect ""real"" effects, since the large sample size washes out most or all of the random variation.",i49l9l,2020-08-05 19:33:51
It would be people who would willingly allow the clinics testing the vaccine to vaccinate them. A vaccine only become less mainstream/mandatory after phase 4 has undergone many years of research.

"Autoimmune problems plus allergic reactions are likely related, but really, you should be speaking to a doctor. Immune system specialists are much more qualified to answer these questions because your condition is not something that most of us here on this subreddit probably have much knowledge of. This isn't so much a question about vaccines as much as it seems to be a situation with your autoimmune disorder's present activity and interactions with triggers. So, I'm sorry I can't help more, but I do encourage you to reach out to a specialist who deals with autoimmune diseases regularly.",i3yq5c,2020-08-05 06:41:49
"This is not a place for medical advice. 

Your genetics are primarily responsible for autoimmunity, in general.",i3yq5c,2020-08-05 19:38:52
"There is some limited research suggesting that vaccines can cause flare ups of certain autoimmune disorders and may be associated with higher chance of allergic disease and atopy. However, it's quite difficult to study since most people receive vaccinations. Also, a lot of vaccine clinical trials exclude people with existing autoimmune disorders or allergies, so we can't really be too sure of the effect of vaccines on people with autoimmune backgrounds.

I have a similar experience to you though. I have a family history of autoimmune disorders (although not in my first-degree relatives). Throughout childhood and adolescence, I would often develop new food allergies or atopic issues (like recurring hives, urticaria and eczema) in the months after receiving vaccinations. There were years where I didn't receive any vaccinations and didn't develop any allergies. It really seems uncannily linked to the vaccinations. But it's obviously hard to prove. People are more likely to develop allergies in childhood and adolescence so it could just have been a coincidence. I will say thought that it's been 13 years since I had any vaccinations and I haven't developed any new allergies since then.

You have the real anti-vax scientists who say that vaccines cause autoimmune disorders. But there are more moderate ones who say that vaccines can *possibly* act to trigger allergies and autoimmune disorders in people with genetic predispositions. Those people would have likely developed the disorder anyway at some point e.g. if they came in contact with a certain virus or bacteria or fungi. Anything which stimulates the immune system a lot can cause it to do funny things if you have the ""wrong"" genetic profile. For example, we can link my grandmother's rheumatoid arthritis to living in a mouldy house for several years. And an uncle developed Crohn's disease right after he and his wife got sick from food poisoning.
For me personally, I try to avoid both getting sick and getting unnecessary vaccines because of my personal and family history. But you have to balance the risk of the vaccine with the risk of the disease, including the fact that most diseases can trigger autoimmune disorders.",i3yq5c,2020-08-05 23:41:49
"Thanks. I've been to many doctors already (especially 2 years ago) and they aren't very helpful in \*why\*. They did give me steroids, allergy medication, etc. And my allergies seemed to go away over time. I had a problem where after getting vaccinated my face would swell up shut every time I would get my period and none of my doctors (allergist, gynecologist, endo) could figure out why, but taking allergy meds prevented it from happening until it just stopped occurring at some point. I do not have that problem this time around, but I also do not have a thyroid organ anymore this time.   

I'm mostly wondering if there's any research / safer way to get vaccinated for autoimmune patients. But I imagine it depends on the vaccine.",i3yq5c,2020-08-06 02:05:52
"Yeah, I rarely see research about vaccines and autoimmune research which is what I am looking for. I was wondering if there's any research for a safer way to get vaccinated for autoimmune patients. I would hope people are modifying vaccinations to be less triggering for the immune system, but maybe it's just not preventable with how varied people's genetics are.

Your mother is probably confusing the HPV vaccine with HPV causing cancer. The HPV vaccine prevents cancer .

The CDC ( cdc.gov) says this about HPV


 In the U.S., nearly 35,000 people are estimated to be affected by a cancer caused by HPV infection each year. While there is screening for cervical cancer that can detect cancer early, there is no recommended screening for the other cancers caused by HPV infection, like cancers of the back of the throat, anus, penis, vagina, or vulva.


HPV vaccine provides safe, effective, and lasting protection against the HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer.",hzhwjt,2020-07-28 18:48:53
"Hi,

Did you get your HPV vaccine? The HPV vaccine isn’t new. It has been around for 12 years. “With over 120 million doses distributed in the United States, HPV vaccine has a reassuring safety record that’s backed by over 12 years of monitoring and research.” Here is a link from CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine/six-reasons.html

Have your mom watch this important video from the HPV Roundtable Resource Library: https://vimeo.com/311592537

You along with your mom can also write to HPVroundtable.org if you have specific questions. 

As for COVID-19 vaccine, it is going to be a while before that is out, and there will be safety literature on it. 

Although searching in Google, like someone suggested, is not a bad idea for a start, it is extremely important to make sure you get your information from reputed sources: WHO, CDC, and state immunization coalitions.

"Hi,

In addition to my previous comment, I would like to add that if you are indeed searching for scientific articles, please add “scholarly article” as a prefix to whatever you are searching for. Here is one that is inline with what I mentioned earlier that HPV vaccine isn’t new and it prevents against 6 types of cancer. The study does a ten-year review. I’m sure you can find new ones. 

https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(17)30494-1/fulltext",hzhwjt,2020-07-29 20:18:28
"I'm sharing a research paper that shows a link between febrile infections and cancer. The study shows that the more febrile infections a person clears with their immune system, the lower their risk of developing cancer.

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361090X06000043](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361090X06000043)

This isn't exactly what you are asking for, I understand. And it indirectly supports your mother's reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated. COVID is a febrile infection, one with a relatively low mortality rate, like influenza. It usually doesn't pose a problem for people without existing conditions like diabetes or autoimmune diseases or cancer.

You will not find research that shows a direct link between vaccines and cancer. The long term effects of vaccines are largely unknown. Like many medications or treatments such as radiation, the adverse health effects can take a while to manifest. Cancer cells generally don't just pop up, they actually arise from compounded mutations over a period of time.

While the immediate side effects of vaccines can be studied, long term effects can't, because if 10-20 years pass since inoculation, any number of genetic or environmental factors could be responsible for a tumor arising and it would be impossible to pinpoint the exact cause.

TLDR: Vaccines may not be shown to directly cause cancer, but preventing the immune system from activating a full blown response to pathogens can increase one's likelihood of developing cancer. There is also a link between childhood leukemia and deprivation from common pathogens in the first two years of life, showing that there is a critical period for the immune system to develop and become 'aware' ... cancer is something the immune system protects against, just like any bacterial or viral infection.",hzhwjt,2020-08-18 20:23:26

However, a vocal minority is completely anti-vaccine. You can identify them when they give anecdotal examples of injury, most likely from social media sources, and/or talk about govt conspiracies, personal liberty, religious freedom (although all major religions support vaccines since community health far outweighs adjuvant concerns). No matter how many studies have been published debunking every single myth (not repeating here since I do not want to spread these), for this latter group who are just not open-minded, best to ask them their “sources of information” and ask whether they are open to modern science. Just these two starter questions will tell you whether someone is hesitant to vaccines or are completely anti-vaccine and are far too gone.

Think of it like a ballistics expert looking at shell casings at a crime scene -- are they being shot at? No, they're just looking at the casings and determining what type of bullets were fired. Your immune system does the same thing and makes antibodies against the Hep B virus. 

For other vaccines the virus/bacteria is either a) not wholly present (subunit/DNA vaccines), b) inactivated (""killed"") but still a complete virion/toxoid, or c) live attenuated (the virus is artificially selected to grow in a non human host and when introduced to a human is not able to infect them, barring a compromised immune system).",hsa38r,2020-07-16 17:14:18

"Unfortunately, no. You can't get the hexavalent vaccine (the ones for 11 month) earlier, because it needs to be done at a minimum distance of 6 months after the second dose.

So the third dose can be done, if the schedule was followed, at 10 months minimum.

But what you can do is postpone it a bit.

The hexavalent (i'm assuming it's either Infanrix or Hexacima, cause you have a similar schedule as my country dose) can be done until 24 months. 

So as long as you won't skip it indefinitely, you can get it done when you move out of Europe with no problems.

"Interesting. I'd normally seen DTaP in more doses. I'm not sure about the others as I haven't looked into them, so you may wish for a doctor's opinion (there are some on this subreddit), but the other vaccines may act like DTaP.

So basically the dosing amounts, timings, etc. are designed to work with that plan you linked, but in other countries the dosages, timings etc. can be a little different. It seems the French way is designed to give the final youth booster earlier than I'd expect, but after waiting a longer time in between the penultimate and ultimate doses (and in fewer doses altogether). I suppose they must have research to back their dosage amounts, times etc. to show altogether it works well. If you are to move, you can certainly give them the final doses early if it's only a matter of 1–2 months. HOWEVER they become slightly more likely to lose effect as the final dose is to serve as a booster promoting long‐term immunity (rather than immunity that could be lost in a shorter timeframe). If you are travelling someplace where vaccines are cheap (Asia, ME, Africa, etc.) you could check whether they mightn't be given a final (final) booster later on for an affordable price. It shouldn't be necessary, however, if you end up someplace like the US where everything costs so much. You're ideally not supposed to administer a final dose prior to having at least six months pass since the penultimate dose, but as long as four months have passed, normally there is no reason for concern nor is there a real need for any more supplementary doses. In this case, looking at the chart it seems France reduces the doses but extends the timeline for the final booster, so you actually seem to have an extra month margin beyond the typical six month guidance.

I think then, you should try to delay as much as reasonably possible prior to leaving, but not worry too much because they will still be administered within the ranges of time that are generally acceptable and which in most cases will not entail requiring any additional doses.  

Edit: I am a bit tired and completely overlooked your child's age as I was focusing on the time between doses. I will amend what I wrote earlier to say that receiving the final DTaP dose at 9 months of age is actually earlier than the normal 'acceptable' age range, and so in this case I would put a bit more emphasis on seeking a final dose later on (up to 18 months of age, but not less than 6 months after the last dose).",hq1l53,2020-07-13 07:36:19
"Thank you again, it's quite informative. What I am not sure of if I can get exact dose in another country. I have inquired in India(where I am moving), they follow different schedule and doses. So it can be problematic to get it this done.",hq1l53,2020-07-13 12:40:13
"If it's problematic, and you are sure you won't have the possibility to get this done in an 'ideal' way, you have two possibilities: follow through early in France then get a final booster in India, or wait until you reach India. It won't be perfect either way, but to achieve durable long‐term immunity your child needs a dose at not earlier than 11/12 months and ideally at a minimum of 5/6 months after the penultimate dose. You could help their immune response by getting a dose now and one in India once you're settled (and have waited long enough in between) or put it off altogether until India and simply use their vaccines to substitute completely. Regardless, it would not be recommended to administer at 9 months in France and stop there, as this would almost certainly result in lower immune response later on (my main worry is your child's age). And again, if you hear specific information about your situation from a qualified pediatrician or other doctor familiar with French vaccination policies, take their advice over mine.",hq1l53,2020-07-13 16:13:28
"Sure, I will book an appointment with pediatrician to get more insight into it from her point of view. But I think what you suggested to put it off altogether and use Indian vaccination may help. Thank you",hq1l53,2020-07-13 16:42:01
"So I spoke with a doctor friend who knows more than me. He isn't French and is used to different vaccination schedules, but he thought the easiest course of action for you would be to delay, and vaccinate at your earliest convenience in India, but that vaccinating early in France wouldn't be a bad alternative if you were worried that you might not be able to vaccinate easily in India soon after arrival given the situation there. (And as I said, to supplement with another dose in India if you were to do so in France early).",hq1l53,2020-07-13 19:25:40
"It's very kind of you. Thanks to your friend for advice. One more question if you don't mind, you mentioned that it's okay to vaccinate early in France and then another dose in India, will there be any side effect of over dose? Because as per French schedule this is the last dose.",hq1l53,2020-07-13 19:45:25
"Actually a significant number of countries have more doses in their schedules than France does. Four or five is quite [normal](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/administering-vaccine.html). Either option (extra dose or delay) can be considered safe, though I'm sure if you looked at academic research in these areas they might not be 100% identical in outcome. The most important aspect is that the final booster be given at a bare minimum 4 months after the penultimate (and the advice is almost always over 6 months) and that it be administered when your child is old enough to elicit the correct responses (normal recommendations are at least a year old, but 11 months in France seems to work well enough). Vaccines aren't drugs and behave a little differently from what you might be inclined to think. Their main role is to trigger the immune system to try to fight back against a percieved threat, and the role of waiting several months for the final dose is so that the body's long‐term immunity is triggered instead of fighting only with shorter‐term responses. The main risk with your child is that by not waiting long enough, there is a chance that the proper long‐term immune response may not be adequately triggered, so giving an additional booster after six months is the way to combat this problem.",hq1l53,2020-07-13 20:06:21
"It has been kind of a learning day for me, can't thank you enough for this. I will try to go with an extra dose to be on the safer side. The situation in India is very bad due to COVID-19 and vaccine may be delayed over there. Once the situation improves I will continue with Indian vaccination chart, which may include additional doses. But at least I will not be worried immediately after reaching there and searching for pediatrician.",hq1l53,2020-07-13 20:16:41

I recall ERIG/HRIG is administered after suspected exposure. H is for human source, and E is for equine source (horses). 

**Rabipur** is a vaccine for Rabies. Rapibur is a three shot series a month:
 One injection of Rabipur i.m. on days: 0,7,and 21 or 28. 
 There is a one shot booster after 1 year.
Rabipur can be given post exposure in a 5 dose series.

You can have your tetanus shot any time. It's not linked to rabies vaccinations, but can be given at the same time.

Link to WHO for rabies vaccinations and PEP: 

https://www.who.int/ith/vaccines/rabies/en/

"In general, names with ""IG"" are immunoglobulin and will provide fast-acting but passive immunity. That means they only last as long as a free antibody naturally lasts in the body - a few months at most. They're used as immediate post-exposure prophylaxis to neutralize any pathogen that is already in the body. 

Vaccines have more lag time on how fast acting they are. Even the best take 3-7 days for antigen-specific immunoglobulin to start being produced at measurable levels. The clinician probably didn't lie so much as either mix up their words because rabies vaccines aren't terribly common for many offices (unless you're in a major endemic country). Did you get two shots or just one? If it was 2, then you almost certainly received both the IG passive immunity and a primary rabies vaccination which does need 2 boosts.

That said, if you have an outdoor cat that is not vaccinated for rabies, you should 1) get your cat vaccinated, 2) Go to a doctor for an antibiotic course, cat scratch fever is a real thing and 3) get your full PEP course. While it's unlikely to have transmitted rabies, the consequences are so dire (you will die) that you should take it seriously even at such a low probability. If you've had a tetanus booster in the last decade you're fine.",h9jnm6,2020-06-15 18:54:29
"Noting on the intervals of when the shots are administered, is it possible to give the three shots all in one day? 

My clinician offered me that option saying it would be all the same, just that I wont have to visit the clinic for three weeks anymore",h9jnm6,2020-06-16 00:48:33
"Noted on this.

I was given the ERIG by the year 2012 and the clinician said to my dad that it would give me ten years of protection against rabies. That time I received a full series of shots, maybe three if I remember it correctly.

Last week on the other hand, the other clinician said I will need two boosters. The first one, I took. The second I skipped.

Would it have any bad side effects when I skipped it? Would that make the vaccine not work on me anymore if I ever needed to have the shots again?

I would also like to ask one last thing. When going to a clinic after being scratched or bitten by my cat, how would the normal procedures go? Is the attending clinician supposed to assess if I need the vaccine or not? Or for preventive measures they always administer it?",h9jnm6,2020-06-16 01:04:27
"No. The Rabipur schedule is important, or else you will not have the desired immunity.",h9jnm6,2020-06-16 13:49:00
"I see. Thank you very much!

I really wanted to know so that next time I wont be ignorant. If we agreed on that three shots in a day that would have wasted money",h9jnm6,2020-06-16 15:38:32

"With in laws that are antivax and say this same thing, mostly about measles and the mmr vaccine saying the mmr vaccine kills more people than the actual diseases. They don’t realize that people don’t die of measles as a listed cause of death they die of complications of having measles. Same reason we vaccinate for chicken pox is that the complications of chicken pox causing deaths outnumber the risk of a death of a vaccine dose. John Oliver (last week tonight on hbo go/ YouTube and he has sources) has an amazing segment on vaccines and the way he puts it in perspective with the stats he uses is so goood. He has stats that say something like your kid is more likely to end up a on death row or something crazy like that then die of a vaccine related death. However no medicine is perfect. My friend had 14 Tylenol and almost died. You can have too much water and die. There’s allergic reactions. They just need to understand literally everything you do in life is a risk.

"Unfortunately, that is unlikely to be true. Just to give one example, starting in 2016 the Philippine government gave the new dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, to 700,000 people without first testing them for seropositivity. This was contrary to the manufacturer (Sanofi Pasteur)'s 2017 warning that Dengvaxia should only be given to people who have already had dengue, because if they haven't, it can make subsequent dengue infection much more severe. Subsequently, large numbers of vaccinated children became severely ill with dengue, and there were a number of deaths. It's impossible to be sure how many of these could have been avoided if this mistake hadn't happened, but apparently it could be as high as around 600.

"Mate, I would not touch anti-vax propaganda with a barge pole. The WHO and Sanofi are both very clear about proper use of Dengvaxia, and no one disagrees that mistakes were made in the Philippines, with the result that a lot of people became unnecessarily ill. I'm sorry, but it's accepted fact.

Luckily there seem to be good reasons to be optimistic about Takeda's new TAK-003 dengue vaccine, which could become commercially available as early as next year, with no negative effects for seronegative individuals. I will be first in the queue for that one.",h81t5k,2020-06-13 12:36:15
"In a word, no.

* Vaccines do not 'injure' people. Most vaccines have extremely rare and mild side effects. There are a few kinds of vaccines with occasionally serious side effects, but vaccines like that (e.g. anthrax) are not included in standard vaccination schedules. That's because public health authorities make a careful cost/benefit calculation such that if a vaccine is going to cause more harm than good, it will not be licensed for general use.
* The fact that vaccines are not 100% effective is not an argument against them. The universe is probabilistic. Nothing is 100% effective. Seatbelts are not 100% guaranteed to save your life; they simply reduce the probability you will die in an accident. Is that a good reason not to use them? Only if you are a moron.
* 'Sitting out your illness at home' is not an effective way to recover from often lethal diseases like polio, yellow fever, meningitis, tetanus and so on. Before vaccines were available for these diseases, huge numbers of people died from them (and still do in developing countries without access to vaccines).
* Have there been occasional cases of contamination of vaccines through human error? Sure, just as there are occasional cases of contamination of food, medicines, cosmetics, and anything else humans make. There is not some great conspiracy. It's just that unfortunately, when humans make anything, they occasionally make mistakes.
* As for the lizard man conspiracy theories, these are so absurd they do not merit a reply. However, as far as 'big pharma' is concerned, you may be interested to know that profit margins on most vaccines are extremely slim. There is far more money to be made from allowing people to get sick, and then selling them treatments for the disease. Indeed, that may be one reason why we still lack vaccines for most diseases--if anything, the financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies is *against* vaccines, not for them.

As for the subject of your post, there are no 'alternative methods to vaccines'. If you believe in homeopathy or other forms of witchcraft, you could try that, but quite frankly, it works no better than rubbing yourself in excrement and sacrificing a chicken on a full moon.",h7kebb,2020-06-12 15:28:51
"I holds merit in that one, not all people can have vaccines. Some people have immune system problems or are allergic. Two, people are gaining a lot of popularity by demonizing anti-vaccers which we shouldn’t be doing. 

Vaccines are a cheat code for your immune system. While vaccines are not a full blown silver bullet, the studies have shown that over time diseases are eliminated due to having no hosts to pass around to. We don’t hear anything about smallpox and don’t even use the vaccine anymore. I had 12 kids in a group of 120 that had the chicken pox versus everyone getting it when I was in school. 

People should be vaccinated to create a nation wide immunity to protect those who can’t be vaccinated. But we should not be demonizing people who are mostly just scared parents.

An alternative for a vaccine is to catch the disease and pray with advanced medical care it doesn’t kill you. Most of the vaccines we have are for people killers and cripplers. These will either kill you or cripple you. Example if polio doesn’t kill you, you often have to pay enormous amounts of money for braces to support your body, surgery to correct limbs with paralytic polio or be subjected to the iron lung for decades. Yes companies make money off of vaccines but could be making far more on the required medical devices that allow us to live post illness.

Hope that helps.",h7kebb,2020-06-12 15:23:57

"If you mean you want to be in research and development of vaccines, immunology is the area of research for most vaccine development and testing. You can join at the level of a lab technician or research assistant, generally with a bachelors degree in a subject like micro or molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, etc. Any subject that gets you basic knowledge of human health and disease and relevant lab experience. If you want to develop new vaccine types, look more to a bioengineering or biochemistry degree. Additional degrees (either a terminal masters or a PhD) can lead to lab management or leadership roles.

If you don't want to be involved in the lab science part, there's lots of administrative, public health or medical practitioner roles in vaccines. Clinical trials require a huge amount of regulatory work, so there are people who specialize in experiment/human subject management, statisticians, distribution experts for large scale campaigns, doctors and nurses, etc.",gzgg2j,2020-06-09 06:24:10

" OP 

I was walking this cemetery I came across while exploring some old small towns in the southern US.

There were many old graves with iron civil war markers near them that piqued my intrest. As I continued to explore, I kept coming across these family graves that had Dad on on marker, then Mom, then child after child after child.

They had mostly all died in the 1800's to early 1900's. Most of the children died before 6 years of age. All different years.  The youngest child was 4 months and did not get have a name. The oldest was 17 and based on the date he died and the special marker I believe he may have been killed in the civil war. The eldest child did not have a small marker, but a large one outside the picture.

I also have an old family cemetery in my yard and the amount of children that passed at young ages is sad. Again markers just say infant, 4 months old. I believe it was common not to name a child for a while because of the high mortality rate.

If you visit any old cemetery you will see how common the loss of many children really is.

If it matters, these folks were a Dr., his wife and 8 children, none of whom survived past 17. And this was certainly not the only family grave like this in this particular cemetery in Bishopsville, SC.

Edit: Reread your question to make sure I answered everything and see I missed cause of death. Obviously I have no way of knowing that as it is not listed on the stones. This is just a common phenomenon in older cemeteries. Also the 3 small markers in the front of the photo are from a different family then the line of other markers.

"Just get it done, as your doctor recommends. Getting chicken pox while you're pregnant is extremely dangerous. I'm sorry no one told you about it, or checked on it sooner.",gpaopi,2020-05-24 01:58:35
"Sometimes, though pretty rare, you can get chicken pox multiple times. It's because your immunity waned.

But it's also likely that you had another infection that resembled chicken pox and you were misdiagnosed. It's usually what happens, cause back then nobody had blood tests to check what childhood disease it was.

That being said, chickenpox in adulthood is very dangerous. Children get over it fast(er) mostly because their immunity is too young to fight it properly and it's not overreacting to it. But as an adult, you can die or have severe complications, because your immune system fights it hard.

It's also a very contagious virus, so why nit be protected against it, pregnancy or not.

One dose will offer about 85% protection, so it's best you get both doses (at least 6 weeks appart from each other).  2 doses will ofer above 98% protection against it. 

Both doses will offer 100% efficiency over complications caused by the disease. So that's great statistis, don't you think?

And the biggest bonus?

"Your mother sounds like my mother-in-law. It's frustrating that these conspiracies seem to exist everywhere and not just in the US. The rumour that Gates wants to microchip everyone with a vaccine is somewhat based on a plan he had to improve medical records I'm undeveloped countries where vaccine records are routinely lost. The ""microchip"" isn't really a piece of electronics that track location, it's a pattern of infrared dots that work like an invisible tattoo and are unique for each vaccine. It's like carrying your own medical records on your shoulder rather than computer or paper. They have only been tested on animals so far.

"Some vaccines do (absolute efficacy) and other don't (relative efficacy). There are a lot of factors that go into clinical trials: what's the current standard of care for a disease, what is ethical, etc.

If you are developing a vaccine that doesn't currently exist for a particular disease, like say a covid 19 vaccine, you would have double blind testing. This is to see the vaccines absolute effectiveness. Once that vaccine is proven to work against that disease it becomes the new standard of care. 

When you have a disease that already has a vaccine, or current treatment, vaccine trials will compare the new vaccine to the current standard of care (in many cases). This is where ethics comes into play.

 It would be unethical not provide some sort of treatment that is proven to work(the current standard of care) when developing a new vaccine for a disease. Lets use the example of covid 19 again: If a vaccine is made, and is proven to be effective, its the new standard of treatment. Any future vaccine that would come out would need to prove it works the same, if not better than the initial vaccine (relative efficacy). We know covid19 kills people, it would be unethical not give individuals a vaccine proven to work (the first vaccine) when bringing a new vaccine to market for the same disease (a future vaccine that could work better).

"First, to address the anti-vax friend’s opinion, I shall assume that they have the belief that there is a link between the MMR vaccine and the incidence of autism. The ‘evidence’ on which this concept is based was reported by Wakefield et al. (1998). However, as a result of both credibility of the evidence and the author’s conflict of interest, the paper was retracted, and the researcher discredited. There have been many studies since then that have proven that there is no credible scientific link between vaccination and autism.

Furthermore, I am also assuming that the friend was very confident in their questioning of double-blind randomised placebo-control trials (dbRPCTs) for vaccines, which is what might have caused the scepticism, however, that is due to ignorance or perhaps a lack of information on their part, as there have been previous randomised control trials (RCTs) in the past.

To make it clear, there are ethical guidelines that need to be followed when holding any trials for new treatments, however, the issue that many have with dbRPCTs is that it means that if there is a treatment already available, then the group on the placebo treatment, would not be receiving any medicine.

This would, for example, occur if there is a new MMR vaccine that is awaiting trial - it would be unethical to put people at risk when there is already a safe treatment available - so instead, there are comparable trials that occur, so that the participants can still receive the approved treatment and then one group would get the new treatment on top of that and the other a placebo treatment.

However, with brand new treatments, such as a vaccine for COVID-19, the dbRPCTs would occur as normal - one group on a placebo treatment and the other on the new treatment - as there is no other treatment available.

To address the OP's question -  have been any sort of RCTs or dbRPCTs for vaccines? Well, the short answer is yes.

Over a million children participated in a field trial of the Salk Poliomyelitis Vaccine in 1954. There was a placebo-controlled group as well as the treatment group. These children were then observed, and by 1955, the results announced showed good statistical evidence that Jonas Salk’s killed-virus preparation was 80-90% effective. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114166/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114166/)

Furthermore, there has also been RCTs for influenza drugs and vaccines. 26 RCTs were published between 1947 and 2014. Two-thirds of these trials investigated antivirals and one-third investigated influenza vaccines. These challenge studies helped to down-select three antivirals and one vaccine that were subsequently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208631](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208631)

There have also been other clinical trials conducted for other vaccines, for example, the trials that went into testing the measles vaccine that used the Edmonston strain of measles. The researchers, after vaccinating themselves and seeing no ill effects, went to the Walter E. Fernald State School. With the parents’ approval, Dr Katz and his team vaccinated children at the school. The researchers then waited to see if any of the vaccinated children developed measles, as was usually the case in the late 1950s and early 1960s. None of them did, pointing to the high efficacy of the measles vaccine. 

Ultimately, I understand the scepticism, especially if it is a topic that the OP might not have spent time researching beforehand. I know that if it wasn't for my interest in this topic, I would also have not been aware of these results. However, I can only hope that with this new-found information, addressing the trials that have been conducted previously (and some even today) for vaccines to get FDA approval, I have aided the OP (and perhaps the friend) in reducing their doubts on the topic.",gbolao,2020-05-03 01:45:17
"From this link by u/unsinkablerubberduck https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/vaccine-randomized-clinical-trials

It looks like the answer is:
- for polio, a huge study was done. 
- based on that and other double-blind tests, vaccines are safe in general
- because we don't want people to die by missing treatment, we don't do large scale tests. instead, we compare vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations to look at efficacy and side effects.  

Is that basically correct?",gbolao,2020-05-02 13:04:41
"Did you read that page? It suggests that placebo controlled tests are NOT done anymore.  It says that it is misinformation to say that they were never done, but indicates that they generally don't get done these days.

""Conclusion
That universe is made up of millions of people, all working every day in the trenches of public health and medicine. They know firsthand what vaccines can do for a population, and how now more than ever vaccines are safe. They also know that a randomized clinical trial for vaccines that we know work would not be ethical if it used a saline placebo that would leave a child susceptible to a deadly disease. This is why we don’t see such studies today like we did in the 1950s and 1960s. Yet we might see such studies if an HIV or malaria vaccine is developed. The misinformation talking point that there were no RCTs conducted in the testing of vaccines for safety, efficacy and effectiveness can be easily refuted just by looking back at history. There are plenty of documented trials out there... One just needs to look at reliable sources.""",gbolao,2020-05-02 12:53:42

"It would be immoral to re-do the double blind placebo tests when they have already been done. Vaccines save lives, so withholding a vaccine puts a life in danger.

Drugs save lives too, why do we insist on double-blind tests on drugs, but not vaccines?  

I very much trust researchers and doctors, but the recent COVID testing accuracy rate is not inspiring confidence.

"Streamlining this vaccine trial process for COVId doesn’t inspire confidence either. The rules and regulations are of utmost importance until they get in the way......

I also wonder about the additive effects of vaccines. I received about a dozen as a child, and the schedule is upwards of 50 if not more for kids these days.  There is no study being done save for seeing what happens to the next generation every time they add a vaccine to the schedule. I think vaccines are important life saving tools, but the overall number gives me pause.",gbolao,2020-05-11 12:27:30

In my opinion is because most provax people have given up presenting their arguments. I know it’s a ridiculous amount of effort needed to do so but what’s the cost of not doing it?

"This is interesting because it does not seem to be interpreted the same way universally. I’m in PA and my now 8mo was supposed to get a flu booster and the beginning of the month and the ped office cancelled it. The article claims primary care offices are a safe place to be, but isn’t that where you’d first take a child sick with covid? And when I was there last month, the waiting room masks for sick patients were already gone. And young children can’t wear masks to begin with.

Regardless, for children who are social distanced, there is little risk of catching any of these diseases. It’s only a risk for children who’s families aren’t distancing (like ones with a parent working in public) and hopefully those parents are sticking to the vaccine schedule if the office allows.",gavgmt,2020-04-30 16:01:58

"Well, your ""friend"" is right that they're not a ""healing potion"" because vaccines are a *preventative*. That also means the logic your friend is using is totally wrong. The only contexts I'm aware of where you can take a vaccine after exposure to the pathogen is rabies, which is an incredibly slow-progressing disease; or tetanus, which is a disease caused by reaction to a chemical toxin as opposed to a general infection response.

Also, health authorities *do* follow the philosophy of risk reduction. Different countries use different vaccine schedules because there are different risks of contracting the diseases. This is why you should check with your doctor before traveling to other countries, especially tropical climates. The US doesn't vaccinate for polio anymore, as one example, because it's not a risk in this country.

Where your friend is wrong about risk reduction is in assuming s/he understands it adequately to make a judgment about what vaccines are worth skipping. The heavy metals comment is adequate proof of that: alum, the most common adjuvant, is made of aluminum which is by definition not a heavy metal.",g9klw8,2020-04-28 12:38:38
"So the “heavy metals” this idiot is babbling about refers to things like aluminum hydroxide or other metal SALTS. The ionic salt form of a metal is not the same as an elemental health metal. 
It’s true the ionic salts are generating an immune response. However, ionic salts are highly water soluble. Meaning they dissolve in water and are easily eliminated by the kidneys. Not to mention the amount of adjuvant in a vaccine is incredibly small and it’s designed to cause only a small local inflammatory reaction. It is not a sustained body wide reaction though. 
These people are so fucking stupid it makes me sick.",g9klw8,2020-04-28 15:07:02
"This person knows a lot of buzzwords, but clearly doesn’t actually know what they mean.

To be honest though, the best available research shows that arguing with people isn’t an effective way to change their mind. Instead, they dig in even further to their position.

In my experience, and research backs this up, the way to move the needle is to try to understand what their deeper concern is. Empathize with them, and ask them questions without explaining to them how they’re wrong. Once you understand their concerns, and have demonstrated that you care, you can start to do the work of unraveling these misconceptions. It almost never gets them to radically change their position, but you might be able to inch them closer to a better informed opinion.

"Well. The only way, in my opinion, is to compare risk of the disease to risk of the vaccine.",g9klw8,2020-04-28 12:44:38
"Lots of other arguments given are really great here. I haven’t seen anyone mention anything about the specifics about the metal argument. It’s important to consider not only the method of delivery of the adjuvant, in this case now it’s very often aluminum salts if a metal salt adjuvant is used, but also the ionic state of the metal.
To my knowledge:
Research points to the ingestion of aluminum having a correlation (not causation) with Alzheimer’s and maybe other neurodegenerative diseases. These are experiments done in murine models with ingestion as the primary mode of delivery. Not injection. This is an important distinction, as the body will have different methods of dealing with compounds introduced in different ways. The route of intra-muscular injection is decidedly less toxic regarding development of these neurological effects. It also important to note that researchers give specified amounts of compounds to the animals controlling the lethality of the dose by quantity. Enough of anything can be poisonous, and even lethal. Anything.
The second point is the ionic state of the metal. Different compounds can have extremely variable effects in the body depending on their state. A good example is table salt. Sodium and chloride are both things you wouldn’t want to eat or inject by themselves. However the compound sodium-chloride is commonly injected and ingested. It’s important to understand the biochemistry of the situation this person is speaking to. Do they fully understand it? I might pose a question like that.
People are not being injected with a solid hunk of aluminum, they are not being injected with toxic levels of aluminum. The method of delivery is decidedly non toxic in this context. It’s likely that everyone ingests more aluminum salt in the water they drink than what will be injected into them receiving their vaccinations. Plus, by getting vaccinated we are helping other immunocompromised individuals not die from something that would be completely preventable.",g9klw8,2020-04-28 22:29:32

It’s only a matter of time until another highly virulent strain of the flu evolves and hits the world very, very hard. This is why there is so much time and money going into research around influenza. It seems relatively benign because a lot of other viruses cause “flu-like” symptoms so we attribute things our bodies can easily combat to the “flu.” But a Novel influenza virus could easily do tremendous damage to a very large population of people.

As this last article is from 2016, I would like to know how these trials are currently. I know also that a company cited, Medicago, is developing a vaccine for coronavirus too!

— No. For the 2019-2020 influenza season, CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed age-appropriate influenza vaccine including inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another.",g70ohd,2020-04-24 10:05:31
"Both of my children have received each kind over the years as administered by their aunt who is a pediatrician. There is little to no risk of either. You might get a stronger protective response from the nasal vaccine due to it being a live attenuated as opposed to killed. 

As far as harmful chemicals, everything in moderation. There isn’t anything in a flu shot that will kill you in a flu shot dose.",g70ohd,2020-04-25 03:09:47

"Okay, perhaps the word unhealthy is the wrong word. My new question is: besides the state of the virus, is there ANY difference within to two vaccines in terms of composition (ingredients and proportions).

"One thing I came across recently is that the nasal spray might not be as effective, I can’t provide a source as I can’t remember where I read it, but the overall summary was that the nasal spray was being dropped from use by a country as they’d found it to be less effective at creating antibodies to the chosen flu virus.

Hopefully you’d be able to find a source to what I’d said but that maybe a factor to choosing shot over spray.",g70ohd,2020-04-26 07:15:41
"Likely no difference in ingredients, though that I can't be sure of. I just tried to look it up on the CDC website and I didn't find anything that listed ingredients. Your doctor or pharmacist would be able to provide that information, though, as it will be present on the vaccine packaging or insert (I'm assuming).",g70ohd,2020-04-24 16:21:54

"No, but if I were to find out that one has less toxins than the other, I would stop being a baby about getting a shot, and stop doing the nasal spray, it that were the case, even if it was a very minor difference. I know it’s a very small risk regardless, but I would just rather take the smallest risk possible, and clearly there is a difference in the state of the virus between the two vaccines, so most likely, there is also a difference in the solution that they are in.",g70ohd,2020-04-25 04:53:16
"What toxins? I can eat a pickled jalapeño and need a sip of water. I can eat pure capsaicin and go into anaphylactic shock.

Is there a specific chemical that concerns you? For example, some vaccines have small amounts of formaldehyde. Obviously drinking a pint will cause some real damage, but your own body produces around a milliliter a day naturally, which is more than in a shot.",g70ohd,2020-04-25 05:13:13

I enjoy working from home; I can hear myself think. I do not really miss the social aspect much at all, but I am not particularly social. In fact I have more free time to spend with my family and on my own projects. 

My point is that some people are not financially impacted; for some people I think it's actually likely that the reduced stress from commuting and office politics and more time with family could actually be quite a positive thing.

>whereas social distancing needs everyone on board.

I'm not sure I agree with this at the individual level. In my case, I can just tell people ""No I don't want to meet at your house; don't come to my house.

"Social distancing wouldn't be effective *enough*. 

It would cut down on infections, but especially for health care workers and immunocompromised people it would still be worth it to get the flu vaccine.

I would think a flu vaccine that has limited side effects would be way more worth it.

I also think you would be surprised at the jobs that are okay right now that will not be okay if these measures go on for 6 months to a year. My husband has an office job that he can do from home, but he works for clients that won't be able to stay in business and pay their invoices for much longer if social distancing keeps going for 6 months.

">you're giving a lot of other things up

Yes but I am also gaining things. I'm actually hoping I can... just keep working from home after the pandemic. 

>If customers don't have money to spend or places to spend it, there's a butterfly effect through the economy that ripples through every job.

This is true. I am also thinking that an awful lot of businesses may find that they actually don't need so many people in the office. If they don't need so many people in the office, maybe they can save on rent or office overhead, increase efficiencies, profit more and sell their product or service for cheaper. Increased efficiencies has potential to benefit everyone through lower costs. If the current situation carries on long enough, companies may accelerate the adoption of automation, increasing efficiencies further. If less people commute to work, they don't need the same kind of drivers insurance, they don't burn as much gas or energy, so they save more money. Increased efficiencies can also have a butterfly effect.

It does kind of sound to me as if a possible outcome of this pandemic might be that going forward, we need a COVID vaccine which may or may not change on an annual basis; if this mutates anything like the flu, the elderly may need BOTH the vaccine and social distancing on a more or less permanent basis. I can't really tell yet; at first it sounded as if COVID was far more deadly to the elderly than flu but now it is starting to sound as if a much higher percentage of the population were infected earlier than we realized.",g4mzgm,2020-04-20 21:44:02

"Currently I have been working from home for about 5 weeks. I've discovered that I rather enjoy it. They are handing out rather remarkably expensive tickets to any groups of people discovered outside, and I would rather not meet anyone indoors until a vaccine is discovered. While they might loosen up the current social distancing laws, it also seems likely that the second wave will arrive around the same time as flu season; thus I think it is rather likely that I will not be leaving the house during that season. 

When they load the groceries, it's in the back of my full size van which is around 10 feet away from me. WHen I get home, I use gloves to take the meat and vegetables inside. Then I set the gloves aside in quarantine for 4 days minimum. (actually, usually 2 weeks)
My wife puts on her gloves, washes the meat and vegetables. The rest of the food stays in the van for the next 4 days minimum.

Everything else I have needed I have been able to acquire online.

I would really like to head up North and go camping in the bush this summer, but they have shutdown the parks and are fining people; I think they may have outlawed camping even on Crown land but I am not sure; either way it is clear that if I encounter law enforcement just to go fishing they are likely to find a way to give me trouble. So I am rather inclined to stay home; further I have found that I actually really kind of enjoy it. I save a fair bit of time and money from commuting and eating out; my job hours meant that I tended to eat 3 meals a day from restaurants. I'm eating much healthier and saving money on food.

"I appreciate the sentiment. 

I have a philosophy: Quality of life is made of quality of moments. When we experience some of the terrible moments that life has to offer, we should go out of our way to build quality moments; this is how we build a good quality of life.

Life is suffering for the majority, much of the time. Suffering is often caused by a disconnect between our desires and reality; or it is often caused by worrying about things which may never happen. If you can't change it, stop worrying about; it can't do any good and in fact worrying without action could be detrimental to survival.

Focus on what you have and what you can do; not on what you do not have, or can not do. Strive to build a better quality life; also, learn to be content and enjoy what you have. 

I am making the best of the situation. I want to survive. I am trying to find ways to actually thrive under lockdown.

On week two, I started chopping up scrap metal and welding security bars. It's really good exercise; my shitty welding is not quite as shitty now; and frankly I enjoy it, if I wasn't working on the bars I'd be working on my van.

"Here (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/fulltext) is Andrew Wakefield's infamous paper that people tend to cite as the modern start to the vaccines and autism debate, although I will point out the sentence in the discussion at the end that says:

>We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.

As I'm sure you may have read already, there were also problems with how Wakefield selected the kids (there were no good healthy controls), and he had a financial stake in developing a single measles vaccine and wanted to discredit the triple MMR vaccine.

I don't think there are any databases that compile information on vaccines causing autism because there just isn't anything that shows there is. What I think you might need to do is refine how you Google search.

If you're ever looking for scientific papers and want to make sure you're getting peer-reviewed sources, make sure you put the terms 'NCBI' or 'PubMed' in your search. Those are two ways to limit your searches to actually published papers.

Keep in mind, though, that Wakefield's paper was published in 1998 and even though several of the authors personally retracted their support of it within a year or two, The Lancet didn't officially retract the paper until 2010. This means that when you look at an article, you have to make sure you agree with it yourself, not that you just blindly trust the authors.

For you, and anyone else reading along, who wants to find out the issues with Wakefield's paper, [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/) is a good article with some good references and links.

BUT, you want antivaccine information, not research papers. It can be hard to actually find it because Google does a good job of filtering those results. You could look up things like 'vaccine hesitancy', Jenny McCarthy and her doctor, or harmful vaccine ingredients.

Most antivaccine propaganda disguises itself as natural medicine or homeopathic treatments, and tries to persuade people who very strongly believe in personal freedoms, liberty, distrust of government, and distrust of experts, so I'd suggest googling things like 'my body my choice', 'are doctors right/trustworthy', 'natural vaccine alternatives', etc.

"Measles, no, but for tetanus and rabies, yes.

This is because the vaccines work differently.

[Measles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles) is caused by the measles morbillivirus virus. It infects your cells, replicates, and bursts the infected cell which releases (likely) 100s of copies of the virus that go on to infect other cells.

The virus itself is doing damage to your cells, so to prevent the disease, the virus must be stopped before it can infect your cells. The measles vaccine contains a [live attenuated](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/types) (weakened) version of the natural measles virus. This is usually done by making sure the virus can't infect human cells, but is still alive so that your immune system can recognize it and develop specific antibodies and T cells against it. This process (of a vaccine taking effect) takes a couple weeks, but after that you've got memory B and T cells ready to recognize live/wild measles virus and stop it before it infects your cells. A live/wild infection ~~only takes a couple days~~ can take [7-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/signs-symptoms.html) before it causes symptoms, so your immune system needs to respond to measles quickly.

[Tetanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus) is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani. Virulent/dangerous strains of C. tetani carry the gene to make a toxin, tetanospasmin, aka tetanus toxin. When you get infected with the bacteria, it can take some time for it to reproduce and begin to make the toxin. Symptoms can occur within about 8 days.

The tetanus vaccine is actually not against the bacteria, it's against the toxin itself. If an unvaccinated person is exposed to tetanus (ie. gets a wound from something dirty. A rusty nail is the typical trope, however it can be anything outside and dirty as C. tetani lives in soil naturally) they will likely be given a post-exposure prophylactic vaccine.

This vaccine will be something different, it will not contain any of the toxin, because as I've said it takes a couple weeks for you to start producing your own antibodies and T cells against a pathogen. A post-exposure vaccine for tetanus contains [immunoglobulins](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-22-tetanus-toxoid.html), aka antibodies, specific for the tetanus toxin. This means that the antibodies (which don't have to deal with issues like blood type) are ready to go and immediately begin to neutralize the tetanus toxin produced by the C. tetani.

Rabies virus is similar to tetanus. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6899062/) is a good article if you want to learn *a lot* of information about rabies virus. To sum up, rabies is transmitted by the bite of an infected animal. The farther from your brain you are bitten, the longer it takes for the virus to travel to your brain and cause fatal symptoms. If you're bitten on the foot, it can take maybe 7-10 days to travel. If you're bitten on the neck, you're not likely to survive unless you get immediate medical help. Rabies infects your nerves, which is a very good place to hide from your immune system because your immune system is trained to not attack your nerves. 

Your nerves are not long, continuous threads from your toes to your brain, though, there are many connections (interneurons) that the virus must cross in order to make its way to your brain. When it crosses this interneuron space, that's when your immune system can attack and kill it. Again, though, it takes a couple weeks to develop B and T cells against a pathogen, and by this time the rabies virus has usually made it to your brain and started to destroy things up there, meaning you're going to die.

A rabies post-exposure vaccine also [contains antibodies](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html) against the virus, so that it will be neutralized. People are usually given a rabies vaccine against the virus as well as the post-exposure one so that they can begin to make their own antibodies and T cells. The antibodies in the vaccine are there to tide you over while you make your own, and often the post-exposure vaccine is given 2 or 3 times to make sure you're protected.",fuv2i9,2020-04-04 21:27:27

"**Measles**

Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by measles virus. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104 °F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms.

***

**Tetanus**

Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a bacterial infection characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body. Each spasm usually lasts a few minutes and spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks. Spasms may be severe enough to cause bone fractures.

What you want is something that can be absorbed without targeting any of the body's cells but that ONLY kills the virus.

"Immunity to diseases takes time to build. It can take weeks for your child to be fully protected from vaccines, as the adaptive immune system (T and B cells) can take 14-21 days to fully adapt and proliferate to deal with the pathogen (via natural infection or vaccination).

Your baby also needs several doses of each vaccine, which is why the [CDC recommended schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child-easyread.html) has up to 4 doses for some vaccines. In the first 12 months of life, the CDC recommends 3 doses each of vaccines against rotavirus, diptheria, pertussis, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and polio.

These three doses need to be spread out by about 2 months each, as like I said it takes time for each vaccine to be dealt with before it is most effective to give another dose.

This means that if you give your baby zero vaccinations for the next year, you will have to begin the vaccination schedule then, and that will put your baby's health under-protected for the first few years of their life. However long you delay them, that's how long it will take to catch up on them.

Assuming that at some point you're going to send your child to public school (I hope), your child will need to be up-to-date on vaccinations otherwise being around other children will put them at risk. If you ever want your family's to be able to meet the child (and I won't judge you if you don't, that's not my business), the child will be at risk if they are not up-to-date on vaccines.

All of the diseases your child can get vaccinations for are deadly, and it is extremely important that if you want to give your child the best chance of surviving beyond 5 years old, that they get all their vaccinations on schedule. 

I should note here that many things can be transmitted via the environment and animals as well, not just by people. Tetanus is caused by a bacteria in the environment, it isn't transmitted by people. Diphtheria can be transmitted from contaminated objects, and while you personally may not be sick, you may very well have the bacteria on your skin somewhere, or it may be on an object in your house. Babies *do* love to put everything in their mouth (and this is good for them, normally, as it bolsters the immune system, but not if it's going to transmit deadly pathogens that could've been vaccinated against).

If you stay on your farm/acreage/wherever for the next year, and don't take your baby to the doctor until then, then they will spend the year to 18 months after that playing catch-up on all the vaccinations they missed. In that time, they will be vulnerable to things from other people that they could've been perfectly protected against. Once you and your partner start going back to work, you will be carrying home all manner of diseases that your baby will be 100% vulnerable to, until you catch up on vaccinations.

You say you're entirely off the grid, but you still have internet. What happens if the internet goes down? Would you sacrifice and not get it fixed just so a repair person doesn't have to come out to wherever you are? If you're using the internet on your phone - what if your baby breaks your phone, or you drop it in the toilet by accident? Give up and not get another one until after your year of self-imposed isolation (and then a further year to make sure your baby's caught up on missed vaccinations, like I mentioned)?

What if there's a natural disaster in your area and you have to evacuate? What if society crumbles in the coming year and the National Guard comes in to forcibly move you? You could've given your baby at least some protection for growing up in a post-apocalyptic world (where there will be no doctors to save you from easily-survivable diseases) by going to the doctor and getting as many vaccinations as you could now, but that option is gone now and you're herded into a survival bunker with a bunch of other sick, gross, dirty people. You may survive, but your baby is fucked.

Or, you could just go get regular vaccinations once every 2 months.",fohfon,2020-03-25 03:01:10

And they don’t have passports and from a third world country so they have never left all their life and will never come to visit.

"> And once he gets vaccinated he will be no more exposed than any other newborn around the time he gets his shots.

So you're planning on keeping him isolated from strangers for the first few years of his life? I feel like this will be damaging to him in some way, but I'm not a child psychologist.

>If I have a baby in a year and then that baby starts to get his shots because the world was normal and he was exposed to everyday life, going grocery shopping with me, going to the mall etc. Why is that any different than doing the same with my son when he turns 1 when he is finally going to be exposed to the world

An infant in your arms or in his car seat can't run off and lick things while you're not looking, or get scratched by sticks or rocks in the environment. In fact, most babies should not be taken to the mall or shopping for the first couple months because of precisely the problem that they are not vaccinated and have a woefully underdeveloped immune system. When they're first born, the only thing immunologically protecting them are the antibodies they get from breast milk.

The B cells and antibodies that a baby has up until about 2 months are [much less capable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9764600/) of responding to disease challenges than an adult's. 

>And I will be no different than any mom who returned to work after their kids were only 4-6 months old. Their babies are unprotected too when going back.

No, by 6 months old most babies have had 2-3 sets of vaccinations.

>so my house is always 100% disinfected on a weekly basis.

You should probably stop that. It's called the [Hygiene Hypothesis,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841828/) and states that the less an infant or child encounter microbes, the more likely they are to have autoimmune conditions later in life, most usually asthma and airway disorders, but also [food allergy, dermatitis, IBD, and Type 1 diabetes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918254/)

If you're that afraid of microbes that you're willing to deny your child vaccinations, please, *please* seek some counselling. This isn't good for your mental state, and it could very seriously harm your child's health in the future.

I know that you just want what's best for your kid, but microbes are an essential part of our life. We need them in order to survive, we cannot digest our food properly without them.

In the end, if you don't get your son vaccinations until starting 1 year from now, as long as you get them eventually, it will all work out in the end. Just when you do rejoin society in a year and start getting him the vaccines, please still be careful not to expose him to other children much until he's had at least 2 or 3 rounds of them. It'll give him a better chance at having at least somewhat of a defence against the things they may be carrying.",fohfon,2020-03-25 04:36:29

"During the first six months there may be residual maternal antibodies that neutralize the vaccine.  But those first six months are also the most vulnerable for babies.  So we give them doses at 2, 4, and 6 months to ensure that they are never left uncovered.

The 12-15mo dose is a booster that ensures long-term protection.

For adults, maternal antibodies are long gone and the adaptive immune response is stronger, so one dose is usually enough.",fmg3jy,2020-03-21 17:17:09

So the current regimen is to give adults PCV13 first, wait a year, and then give PPSV23.

But there are a bunch of patients who already had PPSV23 years ago.  So what do we do with them?  This study is looking at whether giving those people a second dose of PCV13 works better and apparently it does.",fmg3jy,2020-03-21 19:30:26

How effective is pcv13 in  healthy adults and for how long?  I read for the ""rest of their life"", which makes sense for someone who dies 5 years later but not for someone who lives for another 30 years.

"To jump on this - mass production won’t be a humongous problem- obviously yields will determine how much can be made per batch - cycle time for each batch regardless of size will be driven by yield, equipment size, antigen production time ( time to grow), antigen purification time, filling time ( usually relatively short) and release testing ( sterility tests are a minimum of 2 weeks )- packaging and distribution 

but the harder part is all the other moving pieces. 

Even with 
        expedited trials and plenty of volunteers- sometimes hard to find people who meet the criteria 

         Scaling up and expanding the manufacturing process - will depend on what large equipment is needed- and if the manufacturers have that equipment - large scale pharmacy equipment is often a 12 week lead time ( or more ) when there are no people

        Raw materials- how to locate and move around the raw materials needed to where they are needed and get the, tested and ready for use ( this increase not just chemicals but things like vials and syringes etc)

        the regulatory pieces - the manufacturer and all the various health authorities will need to at least peruse the clinical data, manufacturers equipment and quality systems, and in my experience the HAs like to look at the facility and testing facilities.

"Disclaimer: this is going to be a very rough outline of an answer. I am not a medical specialist and it is very late at night and I’m too tired to look anything up.  All numbers in the answer below were chosen purely for the reason of making the math easy. 

But basically the answer to all your questions is yes. You said you have a basic understanding of heard immunity but I’m going to go over it roughly just in case it clarifies anything to you. 

So vaccines in general don’t make you immune to anything. Let’s say that you have a 66% chance of catching virus X. That means that every 2/3 times you interact with virus X  via personal contact, a hard surface someone has sneezed on, or simply  breathe in air someone has coughed into you will catch disease X (of course this is assuming our hypothetical virus transmits these ways). If you catch it, you will pass it on to roughly 2/3 of people who you have close contact with or who have close contact with areas you have contaminated. 

Now let’s say the vaccine drops this rate of transmission to 33%. That drastically reduces how many people will be infected and how quickly a virus will spread. This is how vaccines work (obviously with different levels of efficacy). The vaccine does not make you immune, it lowers your chance of infection. If enough people in a population are vaccinated (can’t remember the exact number off the top of my head), it is impossible for the virus to get a foothold and therefore impossible for person to person transmission to begin. 

Conversely, even if you are vaccinated, if enough people in the population are infected, you are highly likely to get infected as well. Think of it like rolling a dice. If catching the disease is represented by rolling a 1 and you have to roll the dice every time you meet a person (or touch a table), eventually you’re gonna roll a 1. Being vaccinated may change your dice from a six sided die to a 20 sided, but roll it enough times you’re still gonna roll it.

To extend the analogy further, say patient zero comes across the disease and they’re vaccinated. They roll their 20 sided die and chances are they’re fine. Those odds don’t look nearly so good with a six sided die. Let’s say they’re unlucky enough to roll a 1. Now the first person they interact with has to roll their die. Again odds are way more favourable if you’re vaccinated. You get enough unvaccinated people and suddenly everyone, vaccinated or not are constantly rolling their dice. 

So vaccines are essential for everyone but particularly for people like you asked about who are unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons. If enough people around them are vaccinated, they will likely never have to roll their dice. People who are unable to get vaccinated often have other major health concerns as well. This means that where for a normal person catching a virus will likely mean just getting sick, for others, it is a matter of life and death.

Edit: when I said that vaccines don’t make you immune I was using the term ‘immune’ in the colloquial way it is used in everyday language. Vaccines do make you immune in that they train your body to have an immune response to a virus. They do not make you immune in the sense of being completely impervious to a virus.",fidapc,2020-03-14 07:49:05
"the other reason would be that these kids may have younger brothers and sisters at home, under the age of one, who cannot get vaccinated yet. If exposed, even if vaccinated, they can become carriers of the virus and infect their non-immunized sibling, which could have deadly consequences.",fidapc,2020-03-14 10:44:58
"Think of it this way, a non vaccinated person can easily get a disease and be contagious prior to having symptoms. So they can infect people who are compromised and cannot get vaccinated. 
Here immunity is needed to protect the most vulnerable people.",fidapc,2020-03-14 18:32:20
"I have a friend who has been vaccinated against measles and also caught it naturally (after getting vaccinated). For some reason, her body just won't hold onto immunity to this disease. It's rare, but it happens. And it's not something we test for, so you don't know if you're one of those people. She has 2 kids and doesn't know if they're same as her.",fidapc,2020-03-15 06:06:51

Tetanus shot does leave you with a sore spot from the injection but that's all I experienced.  Wasn't bad at all.  Can't remember what my boosters we're like unfortunately but I know they didn't stop me from doing anything......,fhimhi,2020-03-12 17:07:07
"It depends on the person. My tetanus was a bit painful fir a couple of days, but only if I'd hit the injection area or if I slept on thst arm. But was not horrible. Please look into anesthetic creams or patches in pharmacies. Those will help tremendously with the fear of being stung if you put them on your arm before going to the doctor ☺️

Also, for pain, if it's unbearable, you csn take ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but preferably not right after the shot. And definitely not before the shot.",fhimhi,2020-03-12 20:15:30
"An older nurse told me (about 30 years ago) that as soon as I received any vaccine or booster the area should be aggressively massaged at the injection site to reduce pain.

I have done this for all my shots and boosters and it works!

Air travel is still one of the safest modes of transportation in terms of successful flights vs. crashes, and severe turbulence is rare as well- I liken my injury to severe turbulence.

Fortunately I didn't need surgery, and 8 months of PT brought me back to a point where I didn't have pain every day and was regaining strength and stabilization in my shoulders.

I do want to push back on your assumption that the injury was unrelated. The orthopedic surgeon I consulted with as well as my PT agreed that it was a shitty chain reaction/side effect from the shot. Doesn't change my conviction that vaccines are extremely safe and life-saving.

"Vaccinating against chicken pox is very important, because your body doesn't clear the chicken pox virus (varicella-zoster virus), the virus just goes dormant. Later in life, it can cause [shingles](https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/transmission.html) which is characterized by extreme nerve pain and rash in the affected area. The affected area can be quite big, too. If you have a strong stomach, look at Google images for 'shingles rash' to see.

It is the same virus, and a person with shingles can give chicken pox to someone who's never had chicken pox or been vaccinated before. The pain from shingles can last *years*.

Flu and chicken pox are not considered minor illnesses, and vaccinations for both are on the standard vaccine schedule for at least Canada and the US - I am unsure about other countries.

In general the cdc says injection site soreness but there may be more in the product inserts 

Also just a note - there are more than one type of meningitis vaccine - which are typically given based on age and circumstances 
the haemophilus meningitis vaccine ( Pedavax, ActHib for example) if for infants generally, 
Neisserian meningitis (Menveo, Menactra etc) is typically for adolescents and young adults ( college age and military and travelers)
Pneumococcal (Pneumo 23, Prevnar) covers infants and the elderly in general 

So my assumption was you are speaking of the Neisserian vaccine 

But if you are really concerned see someone about it

Edit: also report to VAERS- this is the vaccine adverse event reporting system is the US- VAERS.hhs.gov - it’s their Job to track side effects of immunizations - last time I used it was a simple submission ( and you don’t need all the lot information etc , just tell what you know)",fbt9o1,2020-03-01 15:06:18

"I am going to say yes, but I am not 100% sure. Like 75%.

According to [Immunize.org](https://www.immunize.org/askexperts/scheduling-vaccines.asp), two live attenuated vaccines shouldn't be given within 4 weeks of each other because the second vaccine's reaction can lessen the reaction to the first.

Usually flu vaccines are live-attenuated (still alive but can't replicate well), so I had to check up on rabies.

CDC says that rabies vaccines are [inactivated](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/specific_groups/travelers/pre-exposure_vaccinations.html) meaning they're dead and not the same as live-attenuated, so I would say you should be fine to get them together.

However, please ask your nurse and/or doctor to be sure, before you get the flu shot.",fbobup,2020-03-01 05:57:08
"> Usually flu vaccines are live-attenuated

No, usually they're inactivated. Only the nasal mist vaccine is live attenuated. And either way, if you're getting vaccines in the same day/24h, you can get them both or 3 or 4 at a time. Just different sites of vaccination.

Unless there's a contraindication of administration in the insert, yes, you can have them done in the same day/dr visit.",fbobup,2020-03-01 06:32:13
"> No, usually they're inactivated. Only the nasal mist vaccine is live attenuated.

Okay, if you say so. I did a quick google and saw live-attenuated. Still, what I said still stands - even if the flu were live-attenuated, it would still be fine to get at the same time as rabies because rabies is inactivated.",fbobup,2020-03-01 17:49:47

"I know plenty of people, including adults, that have needle anxiety. It's normal, and not weird. Needles can hurt, and that's a natural thing to be worried about.

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html), the vaccine can go into muscles in your upper arm, or your thigh (look down the page under 'Vaccine Administration').

I honestly don't know if arm or thigh will be better in terms of pain. Each person's reaction varies too much to be able to say. I've had flu vaccines where it's hard to move my arm for 2 days, and I've had them where I had a mild ache for 1 day and was perfectly fine the next.

It doesn't have anything to do with the vaccine itself, it's more to do with your reaction. A little pain or a small rash are somewhat normal reactions because your body releases chemicals to deal with the infection.

Your white blood cells (the first responders, they get there first and attack invaders while also releasing small protein messengers to attract the adaptive T and B cells that provide the immune memory which is the point of a vaccine) are non-specific and just sort of explode themselves (degranulate) in order to fight off infections. Neutrophils, which are very potent and important white blood cells, have even been known to eject their nucleus and DNA to form a sticky web that catches viral particles or bacteria and stops them from moving.

Degranulation releases enzymes, reactive oxygen compounds (superoxide, peroxide), catalases (more enzymes), and antimicrobial proteins to kill off viruses and bacteria, but it also causes things like swelling so that other white blood cells can migrate to the spot easier. 

All these are reasons why sites of vaccines can hurt a little bit, but it's why the hurt can be a sign of a good reaction! 

The only reason for concern after a vaccine is if you develop a high fever, start vomiting, or experience an allergic reaction (throat swelling, hives, difficulty breathing).

If you have anxiety problems during a vaccination, definitely let your nurse know this beforehand so they can help make you comfortable. Maybe take a stuffed animal to squeeze, or a stress ball? There are anxiety reducing practices that I've heard about where you count 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. It can help ground you in the moment and get you to focus on something else.

Hope this helps!",fbfxv9,2020-02-29 20:52:02

"What vaccine did you get?

What vaccines have you had previously?

Do you normally get vaccine- or needle-related anxiety? This isn't to suggest it's all in your head (because, after all, why should it being in your head mean it isn't real?) but because anxiety responses can cause genuine physiological reactions. Most often this results in diarrhea, but it could start higher up in the GI.

Have you been around anyone sick lately?

Most vaccine 'reactions' involve a minor fever, maybe a red mark or a rash at the injection site (though a rash may form elsewhere, too, I think), or maybe some aches and pains. Yes, it is normal to have mild reactions to vaccines, it actually could be a good thing from a certain POV, because it means your immune system is reacting strongly, which is what we want.

"After skimming, I don't think this will be a solution for a vaccine, but I don't know if we know enough about Covid-19's methods of replication and evasion yet. 

Many viruses and bacteria stick methyl groups (-CH3) onto their DNA (or RNA) is specific spots. It helps them know what genetic material is theirs, and it helps us know what's not ours (Humans don't methylate their DNA).

The article you linked says 

>The RNA modification central to this research is known as N6-methyladenosine modification

and this modification hides the virus from the innate immune system. The innate system is the first line of defence, it responds immediately and usually strongly, but it's non-specific and reacts the same way to everything (with few exceptions). The innate system also tells the adaptive system (B and T cells) that they're needed, so if the innate doesn't respond (b/c the virus is hiding from it) then you can't develop immunity to it and can be infected again later on.

Vaccines don't typically present pieces of nucleic acid to your body to develop a strong response to, as nucleic acids are only exposed once you're already infected (and other reasons I don't have time to get into). Vaccines usually rely on structural proteins of a viral shell, or surface binding proteins (viruses and bacteria have these), because then you can recognize the pathogen before it infects your cells and begins to multiply.

Structural proteins and surface binding proteins are usually crucial to a pathogen's infection, so they don't change or mutate over time. These components are called 'invariant' and make good targets, because the pathogen can't change them and still survive.

I think maybe if Covid-19 is discovered to have some sort of methylation disguise that's causing the long incubation period, or prevents you from developing immunity to it, then this could be a solution, but I couldn't find any info on whether or not we know this about Covid-19 yet.

I did find [this](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12250-016-3726-4.pdf) paper about SARS (and Covid-19 is also called SARS-CoV-2 so it'll be very similar) but I'm busy and don't have time to read it in detail.

"A list of facts is not going to win you a debate, particularly against someone who has already rejected widely accepted information.

Instead, what I'd recommend is taking the time to learn the science behind vaccines and immunology so that you can explain to your mother how the immune system and vaccines interact. Teach her, don't debate her. Let her ask questions and try to figure out the answers together.

You're probably not going to convince her that the government should mandate medical interventions, that's a controversial subject even among people who are supportive of widespread vaccination.",f7v1qi,2020-02-22 19:16:22

The link above is from Vaxopedia.org and has a credible point by point rebuttal if that’s what you are looking for. These will point to appropriate scientific studies as needed. Aside from these, there are video FAQs on Vaccinateyourfamily.org, link for which I posted in this subreddit a while ago.",f7v1qi,2020-02-22 23:56:12
