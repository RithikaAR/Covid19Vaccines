"I'm Dr. Vincent Racaniello, a virology Professor at Columbia University and host of the science podcast TWiV - Ask Me Anything",115,nqlwm6,Coronavirus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqlwm6/im_dr_vincent_racaniello_a_virology_professor_at/,121,"I’ve been studying viruses in the laboratory since 1975 when I obtained my PhD with Peter Palese, studying influenza viruses. I then went on to do postdoctoral research with Nobel laureate David Baltimore at MIT. There I produced the first infectious DNA copy of an animal virus, poliovirus. In 1982 I started my laboratory at Columbia which has been active to this day. Some of our accomplishments include identification of the cell receptor for poliovirus, and establishment of the first transgenic mouse model for a viral disease, poliomyelitis.

I not only do research on viruses but have written a virology textbook, I teach virology to undergraduates at Columbia, do a weekly podcast about viruses (microbe.tv/twiv), and much more (YouTube.com/profvrr). All of this makes me uniquely qualified to talk about a viral pandemic.

In this AMA I’ll be pleased to answer questions on SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, including origins of the virus, virus variants and their properties, the disease, vaccination, antivirals, and what the future holds for us.

I will be here between 11 am-1pm eastern time US to answer your questions.",1622669644.0,2021-06-02 14:34:04

I am the American Medical Association President-elect Dr. Gerald Harmon. I’m here to talk about COVID-19. AMA!,357,nmadr1,Coronavirus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nmadr1/i_am_the_american_medical_association/,173,"I am a board-certified family medicine physician, military veteran, South Carolina native, and soon-to-be president of the American Medical Association. I completed my medical degree at the Medical University of South Carolina and my residency at U.S. Air Force Regional Hospital. 

I’ve been caring for patients in the Tidelands region of South Carolina for more than 35 years, where I’ve had the privilege of serving my community on the front lines throughout the most uncertain times of the past year. 

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve helped my patients identify their symptoms, evaluate their risk, and understand how we can avoid getting and spreading the illness. More recently, I’ve been answering their questions about the COVID-19 vaccines. Today, I’d love to do the same for you. 

Let’s talk COVID vaccines. Ask me anything!
