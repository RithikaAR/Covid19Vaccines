"I appreciate kurzegzat (however it is spelled) for emphasizing the fact that even though vaccines are harmful to a select few, it is overwhelmingly better for vaccines to be enforced to protect the larger majority.

And I appreciate you, OP, for sharing this to expand the knowledge of others.

For any anti-vaxxers on Reddit (if they even exist), Just because there is something online, doesn't mean it's true. I can spend 2 years of my life, cherry picking data and make the best video explaining how vaccines are dangerous. Those cases are extreme and almost never happen, or happen due to hereditary issues not relating to vaccines. There is nothing wrong with vaccines for the most part, just check if you are allergic or have mutations in your DNA that can affect you in the future",bnzmmj,2019-05-14 01:01:35

"I think the problem here is the risk of injury vs the risk of potential disease infection. Risk of getting a vaccine injury is extremely low, whereas the risk of contracting a debilitating disease is high without vaccinations. We've seen this with measles already, and people who were anti-vaxx before are now vaccinating because they realize that ""shit, my kid will become injured if I DON'T vaccinate."" I mean, if you have a 50% chance of contracting measles from an infected people (don't know the real stats, but let's assume it's at least 30%), and a 0.001% chance of getting a vaccine injury, I'd hella take the risk with the vaccine. And no, the argument that measles isn't debilitating doesn't fly. It is a bad disease, period.",bnzmmj,2019-05-30 19:16:05

Look, I‚Äôm going to try to stop harassing you here because it‚Äôs not helping you. My calling you an idiot doesn‚Äôt help you. I apologize because my words were childish and unbecoming of me. So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say.

Forget everything you know about vaccines. Both pro and anti vaxxer views. Then get as much information as possible about BOTH sides. Not just on Google, but also from family, friends, your own doctor, Karen, people like that.

Then, take both sets of data and compare them. See what makes sense to you. If afterward you are still an anti-vaxxer, *fine.* But you clearly have the time to populate this subreddit with tons of content. Use that time to re-evaluate, with absolutely ZERO goal in mind.

"It's actually health authorities misinforming the public when they falsely claim that ‚Äúvaccines are safe‚Äù.

How can anyone claim that vaccines are safe when they have never been tested in the gold-standard double-blind placebo control trials using a genuine placebo like every other drug is required before approval?

**No Placebo in Vaccine Safety Tests**

They found that ***none*** of the current vaccines on the schedule have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data. And worse, there‚Äôs ***never*** been a trial of a vaccine against a genuine placebo‚Ä¶the toxic vaccines were only ever compared with an equally toxic comparator (ie. another vaccine or the vaccine less the antigen only), rather than against an inert saline solution. Shockingly, such deliberate and blatant scientific fraud was not only permitted by medical regulators but fully endorsed as part of the licensure and mandating of vaccines on the schedule.

" You are an idiot. If monkeys were given the virus before they were vaccinated, they get the virus. Vaccines don't work during a virus attack. Vaccines take a while to work. They aren't instantaneous, as the body needs to make the memory cells and fight the super weak virus off. If they get vaccinated during or after they aren't immune yet and contract the virus. And with the real thing, once you fight it off it leaves your immune system vulnerable to other diseases. Vaccines have to annoy the body just enough so it makes memory cells, and this doesn't cause any damage to the immune system, maybe just a few cells Die that are quite literally instantly  replaced.  Did you even watch the video? Oh and also, vaccines are not eaten. They are injected into the blood stream and do not find their way into the stomach.

There would be no reason for the microbes to harm the brain because the body is like a house that protects the microbe.

Counter point for the ‚Äúsheep study‚Äù the ‚Äúsheep study‚Äù is true the vaccine will harm the sheep but basics off what I know the sheep‚Äôs gut was recovering from the lack of microbes in it gut sheep have a different bacteria than us humans sheep mostly eat plants and that means that there microbes are different from are microbes.

"Yeah, maybe all that happened to *non-human organisms*, but humans are very different than the animals listed on this wannabe science journal, physically and socially. On top of that, I, and, indubitably others, noticed many other errors in the constants of the experiments.

For one, as far as Google tells me, there is no way that the digestive tract being immunologically affected in any way causes any form of brain damage. Also, a sheep's physiognomy is different from a human's, meaning that they will indeed be psychologically augmented after being injected with a vaccine *meant for humans*, may I remind you. How do you think they would react? Gain superpowers? Also, you spelled monkeys wrong like, three times :V. And you think that mon*keys* and baboons are the same thing. And, first, researching a *human's* vaccine's efficiency on baboons is a not very good setup, and second, *of course the vaccine wouldn't work anyways, because the dumbasses SPRAYED the TDAP vaccine on the baboons.* TDAP, last time I checked, should have it's vaccine be *injected*.
And lastly, if you weren't like the person that replies ""Cool video"" two minutes after you sent them a five-minute video, you would know that vaccines are basically your immune system's workout sesh, training it to fight a disease better, or give you immunity to that virus. Actually, it's more like soldiers running drills in the military, or football players tackling dummies at practice. No, it does *not* weaken my immune system, if anything, it makes it stronger.

second, the sheep study when I looked this up there were multiple studies so please link your source since you got the burden of proof backwards

and last the monkey study same problem as the sheep study. there are multiple studies

and your last bit of ""If you've had the vaccine, you are going to have a weaker immunity, a higher chance of getting the disease without knowing, and a higher chance of getting the disease later on in life when your immune system is weaker.' that's just bs since your body produces something called memory cells and get this I know this sounds crazy but their whole point is to live for a long time and produce antibodies for that one illness you were sick too and plus you AGAIN had the burden of proof backwards because you just made a claim and didn't provide evidence for it.

look I get it you are trying your best to protect your children but the fact of the matter is you need to do research and not just on mommy blogs.

We know that it can be easily transported to the blood supply of the gut, and Andrew Wakefield provided very large amounts of evidence and research to suggest that this can impede and affect the guts functionality, processes, and in turn health.

">You know what kills you

Most of those Diseases don't kill you often at all. 90% of the time they don't even cause a serious problem, just short term fever, rashes, coughing, mucus, mild diarrhea..

Only rashes and diarrhrea are the disease, the rest is just immune response.

You get immune response either way, yes you get less from a vaccine, but thats because the vaccine is in small amounts, and whoopsy, small amounts of disease = small amounts of immunity.

Full immunity required getting the real disease, not the laboratory disease.

The safer the vaccine, the more useless.

Vaccines have to be a certain level of unsafe in order to actually work!

They have to provoke your immune system to even cause a response.

So, they literally have to do damage, in order to have a response.

Maybe less than wild disease, but still enough to cause the diseases symptoms, especially since the disease is injected into your arm, not orally taken.

So, you prevent a disease, by giving yourself a weaker laboratory version, into a weaker part of your body, and this almost, if not completely cancels out the efficacy.

You end up just doing yourself harm anyway.

There's no such thing as a safe vaccine, because a safe vaccine, is a vaccine that doesn't do squat.",bnzmmj,2019-07-06 18:10:50
"Well, I'd go on a limb and say you probably do, just aren't really that aware. You might have some benign allergy or chronic illness. You may get dementia earlier because of the vaccines you have. It can take ages to kick in. It may never kick in.

Well great.

Vaccines had little effect. Maybe saved a 5-10 thousand lives in the USA from the vaccine. Over 30 years.

However, probably caused 2-3 thousand deaths over the same period. And potentially millions of of injuries which were permanent. 

So, really, we probably would have had more success just improving living conditions, Hygeine, sanitation, diet, sex education, knowledge on how to best deal with the disease, vitamin d, exercise, good sleep..

But instead, we have a diabetes crisis, fat people everywhere, little exercise, sleep deprivation, sex problems, diet Problems...

All because we went the easy route and said ""let's make it so we don't have to fix society and environment, and put effort in to fix ourselves, before we treat ourselves for being broken"".

Now we have all kinds of health problems.

The USA is the unhealthiest it's ever been.. yet vaccines were supposedly the best thing ever.

Before vaccines people weren't perfect, but many things today were less prevalent.. Chronic illnesses now appear in 1/2 of the population.. 1/2!! 

The USA is the sickest it's ever been, and so is the UK, and many first world countries.. Vaccines are supposed to make you healthy, but yet we don't seem to see many vaccinated and healthy people.

Why don't we try and find out why this is happening?

Well, who's looking at vaccines, or drugs, or medicine? Not government, not big Pharma, not CDC or FDA, not w.h.o.

Maybe the massive rise in chronic illness and auto immune disorders, brain damage, cancer, etc, may just be, either directly related to the very thing that messes with the immune systems of hundreds of millions if not billions of children, in astoundingly unnatural ways, with untested ingredients, lacking safety testing that warrants usage, 72 times from a baby to an adult, 8 of which can be given at once. And or, indirectly, from the long term side effects of being weak, and depending on drugs and needles rather than fixing ourselves.",bnzmmj,2019-07-12 13:12:09
">Andrew Wakefield requested his name taken off the Wakefield study after the scientific community basically disowned him.

Probably because he didn't want to be attacked and oppressed and saw no reason why not remove his name if it would only increase his happiness.

The what do you mean by the scientific community is the community filtered and constructed by People who have the power, such as government regulators, big Pharma, and academia like university.",bnzmmj,2019-07-12 20:42:39
">Isn't that what the vaccine do, injecting a weaker version of the disease into the body so that the body can fight it off. Thus, the next time there is an attack, the body can respond quickly and efficiently. 

Vaccination is intended to provoke an immune response to a small amount of attenuated pathogens, so that your antibodies and macrophages come to attack and learn from it without it spreading into the wild disease.

However

I ‚Üí In order to work, it must aggravate and provoke your immune response using adjuvants, and these adjuvants are designed to stay in your body to do this. 

II ‚Üí The pathogens injected are vaccine strain viruses, and aren't the same as the wild virus only similar. Hence why it only works 90% of the time in stopping a wild infection becoming full blown disease, and the rest of the time, much of the disease can still colonize your lungs or chest, and can be contagious without having symptoms.

III ‚Üí The body has side effects from this vaccination that are much more likely than the disease itself.
Rarely ever, if even ever at all, does a wild disease come into your body in such a way as it does through the vaccine. 
The adjuvants, preservatives, and virus, all can damage the body much more easily as they do not have to get through a gut barrier, a lung barrier or a blood brain barrier. They have it easy.
They don't test you for immunocompromisation before vaccination, they will only be aware of this if you have already been found to be immunocompromised. 
So, in some cases, it's not only risky, it's very risky because they're immunocompromised.
The vaccines can cause brain damage, organ failure, paralysis, autoimmune disorders, Chronic illnesses, guillain barre syndrome, seizures, allergies that are permanent, even sudden infant death, or just general death, cardiomyopathy, anaphylaxis.

And this is just in a normal patient, an immunocompromised patient will be even more likely to be worse off.

IV ‚Üí The vaccine can't stop contagiousness only disease spread. If you have been vaccinated within 30 days you are still contagious. You will vary different amounts of contagiousness, from very low to mild.
You aren't often aware of any symptoms, so you won't know this unless you are told, which you aren't, in fact they tried to say that vaccine shedding is not real, even though cancer words tell us that it is.

V ‚Üí Vaccinated people can still get the infected by the disease, and be contagious, but might not realise that they're infected because there body has been able to stop the disease from causing any symptoms but not stop it from being colonized to a certain level.

VI ‚Üí Vaccines pretty much wear off between 5 and 20 years. Boosters are needed after they wear off.

Natural immunity is much longer lasting and doesn't require laboratorial boosters, it gets it's boosters from the wild virus.

If vaccine immunity is as strong as natural immunity it wouldn't need labatorial vaccines but wild viruses should be enough.

VII ‚Üí The worst part is, many vaccines contain virus strains that are way out of date, and are not the same as the current wild strain.",bnzmmj,2019-07-13 10:49:36

"Yeah, it's funny because you tried to make an argument but just ended up making a circular loop of illogical nonsense. 

&#x200B;

There are currently ([https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/25/nearly-170m-under-10s-unvaccinated-against-measles-worldwide](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/25/nearly-170m-under-10s-unvaccinated-against-measles-worldwide)) 170million kids unvaccinated for measles right now, and potentially almost 1 billion adults who have no taken their boosters. So lets look at the facts, in the 1st world (maybe the most developed 2billion), there's been around 2.25million (i can't find anything but approximations for some reason) or so cases of measles in the past 15 years, ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology\_of\_measles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_measles)) and in all countries with the exception of poverty ridden third world countries in africa and parts of asia, there has been, let's see, about 50-60 or so deaths. That means in every year, 6 people have died from measles, over 250,000 people got measles, meaning that the death rate is about 1/50,000 cases. That's a very low death rate. It's even lower in the states, or england, I think more around 1/150,000 cases, which is less than 1 death per year! 

&#x200B;

Now if being unvaccinated for measles is soo awful, so dangerous, then how come 1 person dies from it every fucking year? When more people die from getting killed by horses than that. 

&#x200B;

Now if you consider the possibility of vaccine fatality, and or injury, then weighing it out, it seems that if vaccines were actually the reason for all these infant deaths after vaccine injury, which seems plausible, then you'd have a sacrifice of maybe 1 death, in order to prevent 100s of vaccine deaths and 10s of thousands of injuries. (And yes measles cause injuries sometimes too, but they're not usually as permanent as vaccine injuries). 

&#x200B;

On top of that, if we found out that, by doing a placebo test, vaccines were actually not helping, or were slowly becoming less effective, at preventing measles, (since vaccinated people get measles too, in fact many of the outbreak 'victims' were vaccinated (YES I know, shocking!) Then it would weigh even more heavily on the side of not getting vaccinated.

&#x200B;

Now, using your feelings, your instinctive reaction, and your lack of understanding or investigation using critical analysis of the situation, is not a good way to refute facts. If you want to refute facts, give facts, and demonstrate that the facts are false, but until then, stop crying at anti vaxxers for actually looking into it and not just clicking on CDC, FDA, or whatever other pharmaceutical companies studies, that are selling you a product, and actually look at independent sources.

In 1950 in England and Wales for example, 40/1,000,000 cases were fatal. In 2010 the death rate is almost 1/1,000,000.

The problem is, no one has investigated the vaccine damage, at least mainstream, so at this moment you cannot justify claiming that vaccines are less harmful than measles.

For all we know the vaccine death rate could be higher than the measles death rate.

I mean how the fuck did you determine there's a 1 to 1000 ratio between vaccine  deaths and measles deaths?

"You clearly haven't even researched anything, and are just here for a joke, I said nothing of the sort. Don't strawman me.

I say that there is many many cases of people having their kids get ill or severely injured or dead just after getting a vaccine. 

And there is enough anecdotal evidence to warrant investigation to find out what is causing this, if it's vaccines, if it's something else. But isn't it a good idea to look at the one thing that is putting chemicals into our bloodstream and playing with and confusing our immune system.. Don't you think that's a good place to start? Anyway, there are no current placebo tests or safety test that are sufficient to conclude anything about vaccines safety. So until there is a placebo study, and any kind of independent safety study into vaccines, then I'm not going to take your word or the seller (pharma companies and government organisations) just by blind dogma and blind trust.

The other thing is, A, measles doesn't even cause many problems anyway, so you'd have to show vaccines are less harmful (and are actually useful) than measles to warrant their usage.

B, we know that the vaccines cause gastrointestinal issues and have the capability of causing brain injuries, and that gastrointestinal illness is highly linked to the brain health.

We also know that CDC themselves admit that vaccines can kill, and can be severely dangerous, and that hospitals don't allow vaccinated people into cancer wards.. And that kids under 12 months can't be vaccinated as it's too dangerous and their immune system can't handle it, (and that goes for diseases too, being honest here of course) but at least we have a way to prevent measles at young young ages,  that isn't admitted to be dangerous by the CDC, that is called breast milk, it has passed down antibodies that fight off measles given from the mother.

Now research please. I don't want people to follow the mass media that's trying to fool you into a false representation of anti vaxxers and an unfair positive representation of vaccines. Please don't take my word for it, look at the evidence, or lack thereof.

"> More unvaccinated deaths than vaccinate

That's not demonstrably true in any way. 

It's also more complex.

It's about how many lives vaccines actually save (not too many in the first world) and how many they take.

Not just how many deaths from diseases, but how many deaths from diseases that would have occurred without the vaccine. Which is not many. Maybe an extra 10-20% extra deaths.. 

Vaccines don't remove all deaths, they barely scratched the surface of removing many at all.

They prevent some deaths. 

Are those, some deaths it prevents, more than the deaths vaccines take?

No one knows for sure.

Because no one is willing to investigate exactly how many deaths vaccines are causing.. 
However of course they are perfectly happy addressing how many deaths diseases cause, because all they want is to say the diseases are bad, and make people think they are serious, they have no interest in button under scrutiny their own marketing products.",bnzmmj,2019-06-30 11:26:37

>But people can die from literally anything. You can die from drinking water aswell if you‚Äôre unlucky, are you anti-water too?

Change this to a debate about giving guns to minors, ""But people can die from literally anything. You can die from drinking water aswell if you‚Äôre unlucky, are you anti-water too?"" 

You really cannot die from water anyway, you can die from abnormal things in the water, you can die from suffocation from any liquid, you can die from drinking too much water, but nobody's forcing people to drink too much water, or drink contaminated water.. and nobody is getting ridiculed for over drinking on a hot day.

>Vaccines aren‚Äôt just to prevent disease for a single person. They exist to prevent another fucking plague.

there's many different reasons vaccines exist, one of them might be that there is an intention to end diseases.. the thing is are they really doing that, is this even possible, are they just an unthought about, rushed idea to comfort people's fears of the irrational. let's not treat the diseases, let's improve hygiene, clean food and water, sanitation, diet, nutrition and housing, general living conditions, sex education, and general lifestyle. so that the diseases become so benign.. and on top of that the world is a better place.",bnzmmj,2019-07-07 10:15:07

E.g. (for example if you don‚Äôt what it means I bet you didn‚Äôt)

V = vaccinated person
Uv = Unvaccinated person
D = diseased
C = not diseased

V is near another V. NO DISEASE

Uv is near another Uv. THEY COULD BOTH DEVELOP THE DISEASE OR ONE COULD AND THEN SPREAD IT TO THE OTHER

Uv near a V. THE Uv COULD DEVELOP THE DISEASE AND SPREAD IT TO THE V BUT THE V COULD NOT DEVELOP THE DISEASE SO V‚ÄôS CAN‚ÄôT SPREAD IT

So in conclusion 

V + V  = C + C

V + Uv = C + D

Uv + V = D + D

Uv + Uv = D + D

In regards to the 'Vaccines cause Autism' statement, the only reason rates are rising is because of better detection rates. Additionally, the autism rate should be dropping, because of the dropping vaccination rates.

We do know that the measles death rate is higher. We just don't see that today because people the number of people who are vaccinated vs. the number of people who have measles and are unvaccinated is still quite large. The only thing we CAN do is look at a time when measles DID spread and compare their population with the current one, before breaking it down with mathematics to get a relatively accurate probability.

The VAERS has public datasets that record each report they've gotten for vaccinated children or adults, along with calls due to adverse effects and the outcomes. You can look at them here:

Oh, the CDC actually explain the side effects here, too. In a nice, neat list.

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm)

""I mean how the fuck did you determine there's a 1 to 1000 ratio between vaccine deaths and measles deaths?""

Math, research, and years upon years of testing. You can read up on how the vaccines are tested for patients here: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/journey-of-child-vaccine.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/journey-of-child-vaccine.html)

Then, comparing the amount of deaths they get from that, to the population at the time of an unvaccinated measles outbreak and the deaths from that. It's essentially this:

n = the amount children in the study

d = the amount of children who died

They they take d/n, which is in turn, the odds of a child dying.

Taking those two numbers and then finding the common denominator. I hope this clears things up!

EDIT: No, I'm not a doctor. No, I do not know the exact method that is used to determine the odds-- But again. Just using simple math with related numbers should be able to give a relatively close or easy answer.",bnzmmj,2019-06-14 08:33:37

">We could only come up with a handful of documented cases

DOCUMENTED, being the key word.

The authorities won't admit a death from MMR because it will mean they will be sued or have to face harsh realities.

If doctors are encouraged to record every person that dies from measles who's unvaccinated, then they aren't going to count the number of those that are vaccinated anyway. 

The Rockland county, and Disneyland outbreaks were full of vaccinated people, we know this because, if they were not, the reporting on it would be full of titles such as ""And all were unvaccinated!!!"" Or ""99% were unvaccinated!"" They would have such an insentive to convey this, that the fact they didn't, is almost proof that many were vaccinated.

The first MMR vaccine was retracted off the schedule it was that harmful, yet you believe the new one is way better??

MMR vaccine could be causing 10,000s of world wide DEATHS, and injuries, and most of the measles deaths are in the third world where they have low hygiene rates, and poor living conditions. 

Vaccines are likely saving lives overall in third world countries, but in first world countries, we don't need vaccines, we have natural health.",bnzmmj,2019-06-22 15:57:03

"I've spent probably 5000 hours researching books, articles, papers, stories, documents, history, films, talked to pediatricians, gastroenterologists, general practitioners, been to talks, talked with hundred of people and family and friends in detail about their experiences, talked to scientists, listened to scientists lectures online, and I've spent dozens or hours researching immunology in books and writing my own documents. I've also listened to the opposing view and articles from the CDC FDA and who, and all the vaccine proponents, and tend to get information about their honesty, claims, evidence, fraud and misconduct.

Don't strawman and rehash bullshit blanket phrases and sentences I hear over and over by pro vaxxers, who probably just went to CDC and bought all the claims blindly without checking to see if they were credible or just pushed as credible because of the media being 95% against anti vaxxers religiously.

Guess what, many doctors, like Dr Richard Kelly, Dr Zimmerman, Dr Suzanne Humphreys, and Dr Jack wolfson, used to be pro vaccines for a long time. And some doctors are now completely changing their minds and coming out against vaccines.

So, trust a pro vax doctor, and you might just be trusting a future ANTI VAX doctor.

What you mean by the scientific community is the community filtered and constructed by people who have the power, such as government regulators, big Pharma, and academia like university.

Importantly, the reason a lot of the sources agrees with me, is because, surprisingly, it's impossible to find a source that's adamantly pro vaccines, that will post a study that's doesn't support vaccines. 

Each side has their biases. I'd say the anti vax side has about 1/100th of the bias, because we have nothing to lose, we want truth, we want to be right and be corrected, we want to look under the rug and see what's there, we want to solve the problem! Pro vaxxers don't want to solve the problem, they want to deny there is one. Pro vaxxers have everything to lose if they're wrong, like their beliefs, their worldviews, idealogies, their egos, and importantly their comfort in avoiding potential scary realities.

There's nothing scary for us anti vaxxers, I don't care if vaccines are good. If vaccines are soo good, what is there to be afraid of, why are pro vaxxers spreading propoganda, rehashed arguments, desperate fear mongering and scare tactics, smear tactics, identity politics, insults, attacking any experts that disagree with them, and putting them under immense misrepresentation.

I'm not afraid that vaccines are all sunshine and roses and necessary. That would be great. I'd go get vaccinated and no problems.

If you vaccinated your kid 60-70 times, would you want to find out that you may have given him unnecessary vaccines that cause serious complications and that it may be your lack of research that caused them to get autism, or brain damage or a chronic illness? No you would not.

Doctors don't learn about immunology in medical school, or any form or their education, it's optional, and can be taught to some, but doctors are not researchers, they use research to make their decisions.

You should be referring to immunologists if you want to talk about expertise.

Doctors are not immunologists.

""But everyone you get your evidence from are anti vaxxers!""

I get my information from both sides, most of the time I will end up linking either an on the fence source, or an anti vax source, mostly because the pro vax sources aren't exactly going to want to support my view with links to why I'm right.

The people that have power are chosen by big pharma, government that believes vaccines are the reason their country is health, big media companies that are owned by big pharma, big media companies that cannot freely and happily express the view against vaccines without fear of being fired, mocked, attacked, and smeared. 

I don't see many anti vaxxers in charge of these things. If there is, they are certainly not going to be in power when they come out the closet. This has been demonstrated every single time that somebody has come out in power as anti Vax.

For example, Dr Andew Zimmerman said that he was of the opinion that vaccinations could be linked to autism. He was an expert witness for the department of health and Human services proceeding. After the proceeding, he clarified his opinions with the doj attorneys, and he was then contacted by one of the junior DOq attorneys, and informed that he would no longer be needed as an expert witness on behalf of the HHS.

He was then fired by doq.

There is no one who is pro Vaccine that doesn't believe that they are safe, effective and vastly necessary to stop a massive plague.

When the overwhelming consensus is adamantly invested in the idea that they are safe, effective and necessary, it's no surprise that they all say that the research points to their prefered conclusion.

The evidence is that there has been many claims by these mainstream scientific communities and fields, such as that vaccines don't cause autism, when the truth is, there is no evidence that vaccines don't cause autism, this is literally admitted by Stanley plotkins, and they have only admitted to testing 1 ingredient and one vaccine, and haven't even demonstrated from that one vaccine let alone the 15 others and the 49 other ingredients, that they don't cause autism.

It even says on the MMR vaccine insert, and almost all vaccines, that all kinds of brain damage can occur, (even though they claim rarely, this hasn't been tested with an inert placebo or anything similar). 

Brain damage and permanent states of swelling, (especially in the area that is associated with autistic behaviour and symptoms) are what can occur, and so to say that autism cannot occur at all, is like denying that cars have wheels.

I don't need the expertise, they don't even claim vaccines do not cause autism. Every paper attempting to deny the link, simply concludes that there isn't enough data to reject or accept because a link between autism and vaccines.

And I wonder why they don't have enough data. Maybe because they haven't done a placebo, biological, or clinical test!

The same authority you appeal to, however educated, claimed that vioxx was harmless, and were astoundingly wrong, claimed that MMR1 was harmless, and were wrong, claimed that glyphosate was harmless, and were wrong, claimed that DDT was harmless and were wrong, claimed at tobacco and smoking was harmless and even beneficial, and were wrong, claimed that asbestos was harmless, and were wrong..

Now they are claiming that autism cannot be caused by vaccines, and that vaccines are perfectly safe and rarely ever caused serious problems.

And, they're **right**. Of course.

Don't be on the wrong side of history dude.

Don't be that one. You have nothing to lose by opening your mind. Being open-minded minded, truly honest, unbiased, and questioning rarely contributes to a bad outcome. 

The funny thing is, vaccines are even more likely to be protected and held sacred, than any of the above-mentioned.

So, if they can do it with all those, they most certainly can do it with this.",bnzmmj,2019-07-12 21:54:14

Anyway, there is no way you can determine that the chances of getting autism from a vaccine, or injury, or death, is 0.001% there is insufficient evidence to support this, and the evidence that exists, points towards a plausible likelyness in there being a high chance of vaccines causing autism, brain damage, or death. But since we can't do a placebo test, legally, we cannot investigate the definitive truth of the claim, for either side of the argument.

&#x200B;

The 100% chance of dying from early age from not vaccinating claim, is demonstrably, and absolutely false, there are currently 100s of millions of people walking about that are above the age of 20 who were never, or are no longer, protected against catching the common measles virus. And none of them are dead, they're all alive, you idiot. 

&#x200B;

Why did you assume I even have kids anyway? If I had kids I'd possibly give them 1 or two vaccines and be done, if the risk vs benefit assessment was weighed towards benefit. For many vaccines though, probably not. Until other evidence or change comes about.

They could be over reported. They could be misattributed. People with corona virus could die from complications and it is never discovered.

When you suggest the numbers are wrong, but your bias is only on one side of it, you have a bias problem. VAERS is a database for searching for a connection, when they report a death. It doesn't mean someone died from the vaccine. Saying that they died because of the vaccine because of VAERS data is disingenuous.

">Even more people survive the vaccine by a huge margin


even if this were true on the principle of doing no harm it's more important if the treatment is causing death. Diseases are not treated equally in this regard with treatments. If a treatment is increasing your risk of dying for some reason it's usually removed from the market. Look at rotavirus vaccine which only killed zero people and had 50 cases of intussusception. Vioxx was removed from the market for causing nine more heart attacks compared to naproxen at a 4000 people. Supposedly causing more heart attacks because that was also correlation is not causation. But they didn't wait for causation to be established before they removed it from the market.

In the initial stages of using a new treatment we never used to go by the total number of deaths of the new treatment compared to what it's treating. Because initially those total number of deaths are a problem are indicating a possible problem with the new treatment. And since it's in the early stages it may indicate a much bigger problem.

The point is that even if it kills people at a lower rate than coronavirus there is a level at which if it does kill people it should be stopped.

(One caveat regarding this. I'm telling you with the FDA believes not what I believe. If you are dying of stage 4 malignant melanomas and a drug may have potential and curing you but can you possibly kill you at a rate of 20% the government has no right to prevent you from taking it.)


>They could be over reported. They could be misattributed. People with corona virus could die from complications and it is never discovered.

So why don't we discuss what really causes death when you have coronavirus. Because all the stuff is just conjecture. They don't know for sure how many deaths there have been. They're not even trying to find out. Most of the cases involve coronavirus positive people who may have died of something else.
Dr. Beirx admitted this. And there have been cases of people dying of motorcycle accidents and it being attributed to coronavirus. Until they approach this topic objectively I'm not going to believe anything they say about coronavirus or a vaccine.

You do realize if you put that as your end point and go back decades an adverse effects you'll get 12,000 total deaths. If you put coronavirus vaccine which has only been around for a few months you'll get 4000 total deaths. Doesn't that bother you? 1/3 of the total deaths are already attributed to coronavirus vaccines for a system that's been around for decades.

>When you suggest the numbers are wrong, but your bias is only on one side of it, you have a bias problem. 

Please don't accuse me of bias unless you have evidence that I'm being biased. I can give you evidence for everything I say.

>VAERS is a database for searching for a connection, when they report a death. It doesn't mean someone died from the vaccine. 

But it usually means they stop using the vaccine until they figure it out. See Rotashield


>Saying that they died because of the vaccine because of VAERS data is disingenuous.

I never said they conclusively proved it. But it should be investigated and we should stop giving the vaccine until ruled out.


>We could stop Covid 19, but we have an entire political party who has made antivax part of their platform. Because of that, we will never reach herd immunity and lots of people are going to die, it's sad.

"> If you put coronavirus vaccine which has only been around for a few months you'll get 4000 total deaths

Again, those 4000 deaths are not from the vaccine. It's 4000 deaths that need to be evaluated. VAERS IS NOT A DATABASE TO RECORD CONFIRMED DEATHS FROM VACCINATION OR SIDE EFFECTS.

I say again, VAERS is not a list of side effects. VAERS is a reporting platform for possibilities that need to be evaluated.

I'm accusing you of bias specifically because you are trying to use VAERS as confirmation that there's been 4000 deaths.

That's because the number of people vaccinated since the vaccine released has been massive. 284 covid vaccinations have been administered in a matter of 4-5 months! For example, more covid vaccines have been administered in months than most vaccines given over a decade or longer.

I spent the whole post discussing how association is enough in the past. 

Do you think they waited to see if children were born with deformities was confirmed because it is by thalidomide before they removed it from the market?

And the list of deaths regarding coronavirus or not that confirmed either. Until they go through each case just like you want them to do with the vaccine and confirm causation we should look at the 500,000 number as possible deaths. Especially since we are having controversy regarding PCR testing and amplification as Dr. Fauci claimed 40 cycles been too much. How many of those are false positive? How many of those are actually dead because of coronavirus and not just happen to have had the disease. But were killed by something else like a heart attack.

"I agree with you about a lot of this, but I haven‚Äôt overcome my vaccine hesitancy.  My distrust for the establishment predates the pandemic by a long time- I‚Äôd say it crystallized with the WMD/Iraq charade/kabuki that got us into the Iraq War II, but that‚Äôs another discussion.  I looked at the messengers and policy makers/advisers, and you put them into 3 groups(politicians, media pundits, and public health officials) and that makes sense to me.  But one thing I didn‚Äôt see you mention is that they all receive absurd amounts of money from the corporations profiting tremendously from the vaccines and further that I don‚Äôt believe most of the mainstream pundits are smart enough to understand the science in most cases, and in the case that they are smart enough, have deliberately omitted science.  When I say science, I mean a couple of things: 1) our body of scientific knowledge and understanding of the human immune system and 2)peer-reviewed studies conducted by objective researchers/institutions(ie not funded/supported by a pharmaceutical corporation and/or the researchers don‚Äôt have related vaccine patents pending the research under discussion).  The Doctor you called out, Ghandi, has been much more forthcoming, specifically about the 2 ways to achieve herd immunity.  This is a key point for me, as I was sick before the vaccines, or testing really, was available.  But I did get an antibody test less than 2 months later, and it was positive.  To then listen to the dominant narrative incessantly brayed by the pundits, specifically that everyone everywhere must get the jab, omitted our scientific understanding of the human immune system; that if you get sick and survive, you are immune to whatever infected you.  So then these and possibly more questions arise: what are the chances of reinfection? how long will this immunity last(durability)? What about variants(robustness)? Do the vaccines offer significantly different/better levels of protection?  I never heard discussion of any of these in the context of herd immunity and infection-induced immunity- with Ghandi being a notable exception who I rarely saw quoted in more national media- usually it was in the SF Chron near her UCSF home base.  So we were expected to place our trust in pharmaceutical corporations who have enormous influence over the messaging from public health officials(I also consider Fauci to be dubiously trustworthy, given his very likely involvement in- and subsequent downplaying of gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology- I don‚Äôt think that it was biowarfare, rather that he‚Äôs squirming to not be implicated/associated with the gain of function research and subsequent leak of a virus that caused the worst pandemic of my lifetime) and institutions like the CDC and FDA that frequently see high-ranking offices filled by recently fantastically paid corporate actors who go on after working at the watchdog institutions back to corporate and continue to be fantastically paid often times even more due to what they were able to accomplish at the watchdog oversight institution(usually some sort of deregulation or giving competitive edge their favored corporation), to politicians who receive massive modern day bribes in the form of campaign contributions, and media outlets who receive absurd sums of money in the form of ad dollars from pharmaceutical corporations.  This is a heaping pile of conflict of interest plain to see for anyone who even casually inspects it.  

So I read the studies myself- as I said, peer-reviewed mostly but also kept an eye on pre-prints and took those with pharma ties and/or pending patents with a huge grain of salt.  And the most recent studies do not demonstrate that the vaccines will offer me significantly better protection from reinfection- pair that with my general ethos of not putting synthetics in my body unless absolutely necessary and well, the vaccines never met that threshold.  

Had the authorities provided antibody testing and an honest discussion about previous infection, ai would have been more inclined to trust them, but they very deliberately did not and in fact omitted this scientific data/understanding, all the while suggesting that the vaccine avoiders were conservative men(while a man, most of my views align more with socialism) and grandma-killers.",npnaol,2021-06-01 09:44:59

I don't think the internet documented a lot of this autism fear with the DTP that happened in the pre-internet era, but I can link a 1991 institute of medicine vaccine safety review that looked at whether pertussis and rubella vaccines caused various conditions, and pertussis was the only one they looked at for if it caused autism or not, indicating there was at least some concern about this before 1998 (conclusion was that no data existed on this)

You are certainly entitled to your your theory but the science behind chemo is sound.  I was dx‚Äôd with stage 3 colon cancer in 2017.  I had six rounds of folfox (standard first line chemo for colon cancer) and when they opened me up for surgery the cancer was gone.  Path report on the tumor site and 45 removed lymph nodes were all negative for cancer cells.  Been cancer free since and will be discharged as a patient at MDAnderson in September if everything continues to look as expected.,nnpr1d,2021-05-29 17:16:46

While chemo is the best option for treating cancer it is not a cure for all cancers. Watching a person go through chemo is devastating. It literally kills the body. However, if you can treat the cancer early chemo works wonders. It is just so sad what it does to the body.

"Although many people and stores called natural substances ""homeopathy"" originally it meant diluting substances so much that the original molecules were no longer present in the substance [usually water]. The guy that invented it believed that substances leave a ""memory"" in the water. It was conceived in 1796 by the German physician [Samuel Hahnemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy). I'd read the Wikipedia article on it to get the real story. You may be referring to herbal ""medicine"". So many people have mixed the two up that by now many people don't know the difference.

 There are lots of scammers out there making money by claiming to practice ""naturopathy"" or selling herbal ""medicine"". One way they ensure business is to denigrate the competition such as real medical doctors and pharmaceuticals. They take a kernel of truth, that people act like jerks in every profession including medicine, and turn it up to 11 completely tossing out the baby with the bathwater.
It is not a good idea to use black or white thinking about any subject, including medicine. You can use the medical system to your advantage [In the U.S.as much as you can afford, I guess] while also being a discerning patient/consumer.   ""Do your research"" is often an invitation to look up questionable reading material or watch a youtube video designed to pull in most people and make the owner money while often hurting and tricking the consumers. On the other hand professionals in any field know how to be discerning and actually research. Having media literacy is a good skill to have. It will save you from scams and real harmful material.

there are hardly no long term studies for vaccines in general. Only thing you want know on the long term is how long it protects against symptoms of the virus/bacteria. This is because the vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect you from getting infected, it protects you from severe symptoms leading to hospitalization and death. However, if you don‚Äôt have symptoms, you‚Äôre also less likely to transmit the disease.
Most side effects of vaccines occur within the first weeks of vaccination. This is because the amount substance you could get a reaction to (formaldehyde, mercury and other substances for conservation) are at extremely low dosages. an apple has 10 times the mercury than a vaccine. None of the substances from the vaccine are traceable after a couple of weeks. For that reason you could never have long term side effects of the vaccine. In other words, concentration of vaccine is low and given only once -> no long term side effects.",nl1upw,2021-05-28 15:01:57

"Long time corona or side effects from Elvanse/Vyvande (lisdexamphetamine)

I‚Äôm starting to get desperate at this point, no doctors and no nurses can give me any advice or help since this is complicated.
I‚Äôm 20 years old, have diagnosed ADHD
In January i got tested positive for covid-19. The only symtoms I had where the loss of my smell and taste. I was desperate in that time because i‚Äôve always been paranoid of how i smell, always ask my friends if they could sense any odour. Keep in mind that I shower daily, use deodorant, wear clean clothes. 
When I recovered from Corona, i got my senses back. About early February i got my first dose of the vaccine (Pfizer/Biontech) 
Just had a sore arm really, that‚Äôs it. In march i got my first ever prescription for Elvanse (30mg) which I take once everyday. It helps me and all but within the same weak where I started, i lost my appetite (which is a normal side effect). After that I started to sense odd smells that i‚Äôve never noticed before, some smells i was used to from before were intensified by like 10x. It was getting out of hand and me being me, I was more conscious of my own smell. 
I can‚Äôt find actual proof on how this medication can affect your senses, so of course the docs and nurses couldn‚Äôt help me. 
After some googling I noticed people with similar issues. In march I got my second dose of the vaccine and felt a little muscle pain but that‚Äôs about it. Since then until now I haven‚Äôt been able to eat foods I‚Äôm used to and wear perfumes, use certain washing detergent.
Here is a list of all products that either set me off because of the smell or because of the taste:

Red meat, chicken, slices of ham/turkey, tuna
Ginger, Yoghurt, Milk, Coca Cola, Pepsi, Bread (dark and light), vinaigrette, cheese (gouda), onions, garlic
Borax, Lenor, all perfumes, vodka
Carmex lipstick

All of these disgust me, some just have a blunt taste. Ginger, Carmex, Gingerbeer, borax and washing upp liquid n perfumes have almost the same smell. It‚Äôs a chemically strong, ammonia like sense

I‚Äôm thankful for not having any other sicknesses and that i survived from covid but this is making me paranoid, nervous and self conscious. It affects me every day and I don‚Äôt know where the problem lays in.
Elvanse, covid or vaccine?
Please help me. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Is this a network that people actually *watch*? And why would you name a Christian network after Lucifer?,njxsoi,2021-05-24 15:05:21
"It's distressing as religious-based disinformation spreads like a wildfire and is exceptionally difficult to extinguish. What's especially awful is that so much of it is exported to some of the most vulnerable areas of the world where Covid is savage. 

The other issue is that the more you try to combat it, the more combative those pushing it can become. So you have to weigh whether you'll actually give more attention and fuel to them by trying to fight it than if you just ignored it. 

This has long been the case. My cousin actually wrote her thesis on Christian-based medical disinformation and it was entirely inspired by time she spent on a Christian forum. Last year she'd tried to get the moderators to implement a Covid misinformation policy, tried to get them to make a section with pinned information. The lead moderator mocked her saying that there was no such thing as correct information, and turned around and made a section for ""alternative science"" to promote anti-vaxxer, global warming denialism, flat earth, *and* featured threads about the ""Plandemic,"" face masks being useless, HCQ being a cure, and the Covid vaccine being made from aborted babies.

These people think speaking to clouds will have an effect on their lives, they're not exactly digging into the data to find meaningful relevance. I can guarantee you that none of the doctors presented have ANYTHING to do with immunology, virology, epidemiology, pathology, pharmacology or the COVID vaccine in general.

What are the doctors credentials? Where is their research published? Where is the data? What are the counter-arguments? What are the potential consequences of not getting vaccinated?

"What do you mean when you say proper vaccines and what criteria are you using to define them?  Is time the only factor?  Why is time important?  

So do you think the first people that took medicine were foolish? Also new medicines come out all the time do you avoid new ones?",nj9mt4,2021-05-23 16:13:52
"I don't want to bring hate, this is just my viewpoint on this

I think it's important to understand that while these vaccines were developed in a really short time, this is not the first time we have developed a vaccine against a coronavirus. And as far as I know, we used this knowledge to develop the new vaccines. Plus, normally the development of a new drug or vaccine takes much longer because the paperwork is done more slowly. But now, covid was the top priority

I understand that new things can often be a bit scary, but the regulatory agencies and the scientists who worked on this wouldn't just put a new vaccine on the market without testing it very thoroughly",nj9mt4,2021-05-23 16:25:13
"You say ""proper vaccines"" take years of work, however most vaccine have nowhere near the amount of funding that is actually needed to complete the process. This means the most of the time where the vaccine is ""being made"" is actually the researches waiting for the funding required to actually do stuff.

Modern medicine is actually not that old. For hundreds of years people thought that sneezing was your soul/spirits escaping your body and bloodletting was how you remove poisons from your body (I assume you wouldn't do this even though this treatment dates back much farther than proper medication)? It's really only the last couple hundered years that modern medicine has actually made most of the advances that actually work, vaccines, antibiotics, etc...",nj9mt4,2021-05-23 16:28:16
"Knowledge isn‚Äôt in isolation. Knowledge is compounding that adds on to previous knowledge and experiences. By strictly isolating a single bit of knowledge and what comes out of it, you can always find ways to debunk or invalidate it. By denying the COVID-19 vaccine because it is relatively new, you are also denying the knowledge behind ‚Äúproper vaccines‚Äù, what ever that actually means. A vaccine is a vaccine. The efficacy of a vaccine must be tested over time, but that‚Äôs why there are revisions to the scheduling of vaccines. 
The recommendation to change the Shingles vaccination age to 50 from 60 shows an example of that compounding knowledge. Shringrix was added to the market that showed better efficacy even though there was already a successful shingles vaccination available. 
What we have now is the vaccines available for COVID-19 in the midst of a pandemic. As a population, if we care about finding a better vaccine that is ‚Äúproper‚Äù we should at least use the defenses that we have to live to see that day. 
Btw, whatever medicine you are discussing is also technically a poison to your body. You should not feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù taking a medicine because it is time tested. It is time tested to have a beneficial effect on your body in one aspect, but everything we take affects something else that is actually harmful. There is no perfected medication.",nj9mt4,2021-05-23 16:49:47
"When I asses your points, it occurs to me that very little robust argumentation is given and some logical fallacies are present:

Point 1. You are begging the question. The covid vaccin is a proper vaccin, as had been proven by numerous trials. It isf still closely monitored now, perhaps even more closely than usual, for adverse side effects. No corners have been cut in the development of the covid vaccins. As a doctor, I always advise my patients to take the vaccin, as it is involves much less risk compared to getting covid-19.
2.  modern medicine has more of less emerged post WOII. Before that time, things like antibiotics werent widely available and surgerical procedures often did more harm than good. population health was mich worse the than it is now.
Just because something exists for along time, doesn't mean it is good. Slavery, for example. 

The real question here is, why did you post this? Top convince other people? To change your mind?",nj9mt4,2021-05-23 17:25:35

"Come on, thats not a very accurate comparison. All of these things have been traditional practices that have been proven to work. The covid vaccine is different for a couple reasons. Firstly, mRNA has never been used as a vaccine on a large amount of people before, and long term effects are unknown. 

It was also quickly produced because of how urgently it was needed. This makes me think that its a possibility that people are willing to overlook potential risk to alleviate the desperate situation we find ourselves in. The framework surrounding the vaccines is also worrying, its hard to have a good faith discussion about this without being mocked or labeled as a conspiracy theorist. This type of behaviour makes me believe the people in authority pushing these vaccines should not be assumes to be trustworthy, and scrutiny is justified.",nj9mt4,2021-05-23 19:50:43

Not an attenuated virus. An actual piece of mRNA. That mRNA gets transported into your cells to create a protein from it which is the spike protein. The spike protein then gets transported outside of the cell and into the bloodstream.

All those steps are using mRNA in a way that other vaccines have never used before.

"As per your quote: ‚ÄúHuman gene therapy seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use‚Äù

An mRNA vaccine does not manipulate genes or alter the biological properties of living cells as it does not enter any cells. Rather, it allows a ribosome to make a copies of the information contained within. In this case to make copies of the spike protein so that the immune system can respond to this antigen.

The below article from Forbes covers this... as do countless other articles and scientific sources.

From the article:

‚ÄúWhen a cell wants to produce a protein, it uses the DNA to produce a copy of mRNA. That mRNA then serves as a blueprint for the protein that is built by the ribosomes in your cells. The DNA is in the nucleus of the cell. The ribosomes are not. Thus, the mRNA from a Covid-19 vaccine will not go into the nucleus but instead will simply go to the ribosomes, which in turn will manufacture the spike protein.‚Äù

If you disagree with this, please tell me which cell type does this vaccine enter to modify or manipulate the gene it expresses. Or, which cell type is biologically altered?

You‚Äôre incorrect. Think of any consumer product that is tested, say, by Underwriter‚Äôs Laboratories. Once that product passes, any non-substantive changes or improvements do not need to undergo the same testing. If the individual component can be shown as safe, and the original construct is safe, then it is safe.

The construct of the mRNA vaccine *has* been in development for over a decade.
Changing the protein being made does nothing require you to prove the vehicle (nanolipids, etc.) are safe all over again.

And no, this is not like adding two things together that will make some unsafe new whole, like mixing bleach and ammonia. 

I‚Äôm still not quite clear as to why you‚Äôre afraid of mRNA. Your body is awash in foreign genetic material every day (No, I‚Äôm not making that joke). You eat it, for fuck‚Äôs sake. You drink it. You breathe it. It is *unavoidable*. 

As for testing for this *exact* combo of vaccine construct and antigen, the sole difference between accepted for emergency use and what you would call ‚ÄúFDA Approved‚Äù is that we carry out a lot of the safety testing (Phase I, II, and III) at the same time as Production.

"> From your answer I'll assume you can't name another such viral disease.

This isn't what I was saying. It is true that you're immune to covid after you've recovered from it, but the immunity doesn't last forever. According to a study, it can last up to 8 months (https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-long-does-immunity-last-after-covid-19-vaccination#:~:text=Natural%20immunity%20(i.e.%20immunity%20in,to%20research%20published%20in%20Science.). 

And another article states that it can vary between 35 days to 4 decades and that:
> The key message from this study is that the longevity of functional neutralising antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 can vary greatly and it is important to monitor this at an individual level

(https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-scientists-find-immunity-to-covid-19-vary-greatly-in-individuals-who)

But it‚Äôs not a yearly thing right now and it only will be if we continue to let it mutate the only way to eradicate it completely is herd immunity which is estimated to require 70-90% of the population be vaccinated.

"That's opinion piece about a ""research"" paper that performs no actual research and was written by an anti-vaxx money pit that parades around under a BS non-descript name. Congrats, your link has literally zero credibility.

As for the paper...

My first day of my pharmacology class, the professor showed us a research paper that demonstrated that people who receive annual check-ups tend to live longer. Pretty simple correlation, right? Go to a doctor more often, get diagnosed earlier, live longer. Except correlation does not equal causation. Turns out, going to a doctor once a year does not have any significant impact on longevity when you normalize for lifestyle. What actually affected lifespan was a combination of factors like healthy eating, exercise and seeing a doctor early instead of waiting for a condition to become severe. Seeing a doctor annually was just one trait that was more common for people more health conscious than those who waited to seek treatment and/or did not take good care of their health. It was an ancillary effect, not an action. The point was to demonstrate how a simple perception can be completely wrong.

The study you reference, as far as I can tell, does not normalize for lifestyle nor does it perform independent verification of each subject. So yes, parents who vaccinate their children are also much more likely to take their child to a mental health practitioner and receive a diagnosis of a neuro-developmental disorder like ADHD than a parent who refuses to perform the most basic of health practices like immunization. The paper is about as useful as saying that gay conversion therapy works because 100% of people who go to gay conversion self-report being ""cured"".

Also consider many ppl will have their TCELLS doing the work therefore a test wouldn‚Äôt show antibodies because the immune system didn‚Äôt require activity to fight the virus.  Healthy people.  Natural herd immunity historically last a lifetime. Also consider that the vaccines were not produced with the covid SARS 2 strain of virus. They used common cold and pink eye virus.,nd54k3,2021-05-18 04:57:58

So what is the point of the vaccine then?",nd54k3,2021-05-18 05:23:18
"No, you need both antibodies and T-cells to fight off a disease. And natural herd immunity doesn't exist as this doesn't work without a vaccine. Also, I think you could theoretically even produce a vaccine without using any virus by just synthesising the mRNA. So, in the end, all that matters is that the genetic material belongs to covid to make the vaccine work",nd54k3,2021-05-18 14:01:06
"If I had to guess, mainly for logistical reasons. Antibody tests take a while to do and you'd need to develop a whole new infrastructure to be able perform them at the same scale as our current vaccination rates (you'd need mass testing, lab techs, equipments...)

Much better to just vaccinate everyone and risk wasting a few vaccines, than vaccinate more slowly and at a higher cost per dose, just to make sure no one already has antibodies.",nd54k3,2021-05-16 03:15:17

"OP, I wouldn't trust this comment. There is a point to the vaccine, which is to generate a memory response in case covid somehow enters your body in the future, so that you don't get sick

As for whether you need the vaccine if you already have antibodies:

>Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That‚Äôs because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible‚Äîalthough rare‚Äîthat you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again.

"Well that‚Äôs not science. Science shows natural herd immunity is the only way to achieve the desired goal. Sadly vaccines can‚Äôt deliver long term immunity or even lifetime immunity.  Check out the flu disaster.  Thus, why they shove boosters at you. Yet, we see MLB, NHL, NFL all contracting the infection (not disease) post vax.  And TCELLS are first line of defense. They can mitigate foreign entities before it gets to the immune system which would then register and instigate the defense. But stick to what scripts the CDC is pushing if you must.  I‚Äôll stick with long term scientific data.",nd54k3,2021-05-19 04:17:22
üòÇüòÇüòÇyes most vaccines work this way. But the covid vaccine is way different. It uses MRNA which is genetic material. We have no clue about the long term effects of the mRNA or the antibodies it creates.,nd54k3,2021-05-16 04:38:27
"> Well that's not science.

I'm a scientist/student in molecular biology and from what I know, natural herd immunity is not something that can be reached. With vaccines however we can reach herd immunity, were able to stop the spread of many diseases and were even able to eradicate polio. If you have a credible source that states otherwise, feel free to give me a link 

Also, T-cells are not the first line of defense. The first line of defense is the innate immune system, which consists of other cells such as dendritic cells. And again, T-cells and B-cells (the producers of antibodies) work together, so you need both of them to fight off a disease. So, I'm not quoting the CDC; this is what I learned in my education and career",nd54k3,2021-05-19 10:48:17
"‚ÄúmRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine.‚Äù

Basically literally what I just said. 

we know mRNA will have no long term side effects, because besides what gives the weaker version of COVID, there *IS* nothing left to give side effects. Anything that would be ‚Äúlong term‚Äù would have to be a side effect of the virus itself, not mRNA. And we already know how vaccines work to make the virus less weak. So I ask, what‚Äôs dangerous about it?",nd54k3,2021-05-16 04:41:20
"Everything in the replies to you about the scientific facts about mRNA vaccines is correct.

But also, not all the COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA based. Those from Pfizer and Moderna are. I had the Oxford-AstraZeneca one, which isn‚Äôt.

Since your inaccurate beliefs regarding mRNA vaccines are preventing you getting those specific shots, will you be seeking out one of the other, more traditional vaccines?

Or will you be finding a reason to avoid those too, because this really isn‚Äôt about mRNA anxiety but about you wanting to find reasons to refuse vaccines in general?",nd54k3,2021-05-20 18:23:50
I don‚Äôt think you understand between traditional vaccines which inject antigens and mRNA vaccines which inject viral genetic material. You are so out of context. And I never said the vaccine is dangerous. I said it could have unknown long term affects and we don‚Äôt know how long the antibodies last because this is the first ever mRNA vaccine to be used on the public,nd54k3,2021-05-16 04:43:25
"I don‚Äôt refuse vaccines in general. I have all my immunizations that are required. Not getting the covid vaccine simply because I already got covid and taking a vaccine for a virus I already got is foolish. I also went to labcorp and tested positive for sars cov 2 antibodies a few days ago so getting an experimental vaccine is pointless. As for the mRNA vaccines, they‚Äôve been tried before on other viruses like sars and Mers and a few others, and they all failed and some caused antibody dependent enhancement which could be deadly. How about you do your research first before you patronize ppl. It‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to be hesitant on the vaccine.

No you didn‚Äôt explain it. This covid vaccine uses a mechanism that has never been used before. That means it it nothing like previous vaccines we‚Äôve had. Older vaccines use viral PROTEINS and this vaccine uses viral GENETIC MATERIAL (mRNA).,nd54k3,2021-05-16 04:56:27

"I'm gonna put it out there that before hearing about the COVID vaccine, I was entirely pro-vax. I support administration of all necessary vaccines, but I refuse to take a vaccine that has become artificially necessary, especially one described in any way like the COVID vaccine. I had a talk with my parents. None of us plan to get the vaccine and we are prepared to be shamed for that, but nobody will call me ignorant without hearing my voice in the matter. Don't tell me about ignorance. I wore a mask. I stayed home for almost the entire month after the lockdown started. The reason this pandemic continued is because of the ignorance of others, those who would have the hubris to call me ignorant and stupid for doing what needed to be done in the beginning and refusing to do what I was trying to prevent when they're the stupid ones for refusing to flatten the curve in the beginning only to throw a hissy fit over an actually patriotic citizen who doesn't want to participate in the thing he was trying to prevent. Another thing worth noting is that the vaccine doesn't even make you fully immune, which is about as effective as slapping a band-aid on someone's head and thinking that will not only heal a concussion, but also prevent them from suffering any brain injury in the future. I don't want heat for this because I was an upstanding citizen and contributed in the beginning, but what good did that do? We're still suffering in the pandemic. If I contribute the same way as I have now, nothing will change, but nothing will change if I contribute more by getting the vaccine. I'm no disease spreader, but I refuse to feel even more crappy than I do on a daily basis just to make everyone else feel a little better. I suffered because of everyone else's ignorance, so maybe it's time that karmic retribution sets in and they suffer for their ignorance as well. Have fun feeling like crap for at least two days and realizing that not only are you not fully immune, but that after you got this insufficient vaccine, we did some studies and actually looked at the data we gave to you and found out that you still need to wear a mask, meaning that all of the suffering you went through after getting the vaccine was almost pointless and you are still stuck in the same boat as me, the person who didn't get vaccinated and is still just as likely to catch or spread a respiratory disease as you, except you had your hopes crushed and I'll sip on my hot chocolate with my low expectations being met or exceeded and say ""So, how does this make you feel?""",nc8yt0,2021-05-14 16:45:30

Let me tell you, anyone with more than half a brain cell who really wanted to be out of this pandemic wore a mask and socially distanced. I did. I still suffered. I'm done suffering for the benefit of a society who isn't willing to do their part to benefit themselves as well. I did my part, nothing happened. I'm still doing my part. Nothing is happening. Nothing will happen if I get the vaccine because after everyone is vaccinated, the CDC will realize that they told us the vaccine doesn't fully immunize you, so everyone still has to wear masks. I would rather keep wearing a mask than feel like a pile of garbage for a week and still have to wear a mask. It's like if you own a car that breaks down a lot and smells like cigarette smoke.

My main problem with everything is that I did everything asked of me, but nobody else did, and now that I'm skeptical of getting a vaccine that I was working to prevent the need for, I'm going to be bad person, but everyone else who let the virus get to this point isn't going to suffer stigma? They get off with no consequences because now, instead of the idiots who did nothing to help the world, the upstanding citizens who wore masks and socially distanced and now have had enough of this bullshit and won't get a vaccine are the bad guy? I'm not the villain in this story. I'm not the hero, but I'm not the villain. When the CDC and WHO realize that the case count isn't going down after the vaccine, they will just tell us to wear masks again. I'm tired of all of this crap. I just want all of this to end. I've done the work. If people want results, everyone has to contribute. I refuse be the only one actually trying anymore.

Not getting vaccinated is selfish. You should feel ashamed that YOU are drawing out the pandemic now. 

The only reason the CDC would reverse their mask rules is if a variety takes hold, which could happen if people don't get valued.

Antivaxxers have been batching about how the masks rules will never go away because it is the new form of government tyranny. New ruling come out reversing policy due to us beating the virus. Then the narrative changes to whatever the hell you are batching about now.

I can't remember which one since I was super young but I did haha. And most vaccines are only 95 percent effective. Just like the Pfizer and Moderna. It sounds like now you don't want to get it just to try and one up the government? Which is your right but it seems silly to me.",nc8yt0,2021-05-14 18:05:24
"The mask rules won't go away because of the idiots. The point of the lockdown was to stop the disease. I'm refusing to get the vaccine because I've done my work and I won't do any more than this if it involves feeling sick. I wear my mask because I don't want to catch or spread a disease. You can bet that as soon as I can, I will be leaving this dumpster fire of a nation by any means necessary. I haven't truly enjoyed my life since the school year began. I won't make it more insufferable just to avoid social stigma and not have to wear a mask for 3 days only to find out that not enough people got vaccinated and those who did aren't actually fully immunized so everyone still has to wear masks. I'm done doing my part for this world if it makes no difference. I want peer reviewed, indisputable proof that enough people are fully vaccinated and that being fully vaccinated means sufficient immunity so that I don't have to wear a mask when I graduate in 2 years. I think we all need to get over ourselves. If we want to get out of the hole, we need to put down the shovel. Putting down the shovel meant wearing masks and abiding by a two week lockdown, I did that. Then we just had to wear masks. I'm still doing that. Now we have a vaccine because not enough people respected the lockdowns, then not enough people wore masks. When does it end? Are we going to be forced not to drive anywhere? Are we going to have to go through a surgery? The morons will just refuse to do anything helpful. I'm not a moron. I'm doing things that are helpful. Not everything helpful, because the most effective way to ensure I don't spread a respiratory illness is to ensure that I never come into contact with anyone ever again, but I'm doing something that helps and I draw the line here. I refuse to go any further as far as a COVID vaccine is concerned. I'm sorry if you don't like that, but there wouldn't be a vaccine for me to refuse if the pandemic hadn't gotten this far and the pandemic wouldn't have gotten this far if everyone had done their part in the beginning. Don't just blame me for my refusal. Blame all of the morons and leftovers and rejects that no other country wanted, so they ended up in the United States where they became free to do anything without consequence, including essentially killing people by fostering a disease.",nc8yt0,2021-05-14 17:40:47
"I don't want to get it if it won't generate results, it hasn't had much of an opportunity to get results yet, so at the moment, I am refusing to get it.

"Good finding a country that will accept incomplete vaccination records.

Your strawman argument that people will be forced to get surgeries? Where does that even come from? That slippery slope logical fallacy is used by antivax people to pretent like a voluntary shot will be the start of some sort of governmental overreach. Has there ever been a mandatory surgery? Even one. No. Because that doesn't make sense. Herd immunity isn't solved by surgeries. That is insane.

Also the morons you are citing are YOU. Honestly how the fuck are you missing that. Not getting vaccinated allows the virus to continue to exist and prevents herd immunity.

Your wall of text makes no sense. Good fuck you won't stop bitching about society not taking masks seriously when you are refusing to vaccinate and end the virus. I am glad your idiocy isn't communicable or I would be brain dead.",nc8yt0,2021-05-14 17:49:01

"Well, I can't make the Covid virus more deadly, but the virus is doing that on its own through mutation. The sooner we can get as many people vaccinated as possible, the less chance the virus has to mutate into something less treatable, more deadly and more transmissible. There is currently about a 1% mortality rate for Covid, but of course that depends on your comorbidities (hypertension, asthma, immune suppression etc), and perhaps (now with mutation) what strain you get.

All the Covid vaccines available in the US are FDA approved through an emergency use authorization (EUA), so I am a bit confused what you mean by ""FDA approved."" Even when drugs and vaccines are fully approved, the drug/vaccine goes into what's called phase 4 clinical trials. What that means is the FDA continues to look at human trials and clinical data to determine if the therapeutic should continue to be on the market. So the idea of ""finishing human trials"" is something that never actually occurs in the US for any drug or therapeutic.

I just heard the director of the NIH discuss that the vaccine trials already conducted were the most rigorous of any vaccine trials in US history. No corners were cut and the data has been more available to the public for scrutiny than ever before. He is not a drug company executive and has zero financial incentive to say this (and everything to lose if he is wrong). Plus he is getting his granddaughter vaccinated as I write this. Personally, I just got my young daughter vaccinated yesterday.

Bottom line is that everything in medicine is a risk benefit decision. The data have clearly demonstrated that what little risk there may be to getting the vaccine is far far far outweighed by what people experience with Covid. The latest data on long Covid is that as much as 10% of infected get long Covid which has dramatic negative effects on many organ systems in the body like the lungs and brain just to name two.  So it is not just death we are talking about, there is the reality of life long disability from long Covid in 10% of people who get infected.",nafbc5,2021-05-13 18:32:20

‚ÄúThe most convincing evidence, though, is just starting to emerge among real-world data. In Israel, where more than 90% of those age 60 and over have been vaccinated, ‚Äúcases have plummeted in this population,‚Äù Gandhi notes. ‚ÄúNot just hospitalizations, which we expected, but cases [asymptomatic infection] as well.‚Äù Moreover, data from vaccinated health care workers recently published in the Lancet and preprint servers show reduced rates of asymptomatic infection and low viral loads in the nose when swabbing after vaccination.
‚ÄúI think that in a few months, we are going to be able to say with certainty that these vaccines not only protect you, they also protect those around you,‚Äù Ranney says.‚Äù

Also your girlfriend is incredibly irresponsible being a LMT and not being vaccinated. It‚Äôs idiots like her that give the profession a bad name. And she‚Äôs diabetic? Jesus Christ.",n9sf0j,2021-05-11 17:25:11
"That 16 year old is much brighter, well-informed and civilly minded than you.

Despite there being ongoing chickenpox outbreaks and a resurgence of measles. When kids at the preschool got chickenpox, she blamed it on the two-year-old sister of a little boy in remission for leukemia who'd been vaccinated at his oncologist's urging, insisting that she had shedded the virus and contaminated everyone.

(https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31192-3/fulltext)

Also, being vegan is doing something positive. You are not supporting an industry that kills about 70 billion land animals per year (and over a trillion marine animals) and contributes 14,5% (newer studies suggest it's more like 25% or even significantly higher) of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. 

You get vaccinated because you want to stop the spread of diseases and protect yourself and others.

Being vegan is essentially doing the same. By being vegan, you don't support the killing of sentient beings for your diet/lifestyle and you are reducing your impact on the environment by a large amount (adopting a vegan diet has been shown to be the single most effective way of reducing your own carbon footprint, after having fewer children).

"you're doing great.  You've explained it very well.   


mRNA is a molecule. It's a ""messenger""(hence the M) molecule. It can't alter anything in your body. It just has a message, and that message as you said, is instructions to make a protein spike just like the one covid has.   


It's wrapped in some fat, and floating in saline water, and that's literally it for the vaccine. That's why they have to be in a deep freeze, there's no preservatives or such that antivaxxers usually go on about.   


Once your body has the instructions, the molecules are tossed. The longest the mrna can remain in your body is six weeks. Your body in the meantime made the proteins and your Immune Systems says OH HELL NO and destroys them. And then your memory cells remember them for next time.   


later in life you get the real covid, memory cells say ohhhhh shit and white blood cells/immune system attacks on site. Well before covid can replicate like mad, which is how folks get so sick currently. It takes the immune system too long to recognize the intruder, as it stands.

There is propaganda. They don't let us see everything. That is where my concern lies. Why are things being hidden? I'd rather wait until it's FDA approved. Don't expect me to follow the governments every request when they have lied before. My integrity to myself must come first. I wear a mask. I wear big glasses.,n3j2rt,2021-05-11 22:23:28
"Yes the government has lied plenty, but please don‚Äôt conflate the vaccination effort with US government propaganda. Propaganda is political, the vaccine effort is global. It‚Äôs the one thing our national enemies agree with us on right now. Also, the clinical trial data is all publicly available, for all the vaccines, so while I understand a hesitation to get vaccinated before full fda approval, also realize that the amount of testing done on these vaccines is insanely more robust than many fda approved products, simply because of the amount of resources thrown into getting these vaccines finished. It‚Äôs the biggest medical research operation in human history. This isn‚Äôt some half-assed ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôll work‚Äù injection we‚Äôre talking about.",n3j2rt,2021-05-12 16:47:20

"Is that why Astrazeneca was just pulled after they assured everyone in my province up until last week that it was perfectly safe? I am waiting until more time and testing has been done. They do not let all information out for us to see. We are no North Korea but those who have another side to share are not getting to share it fully or with respect (their reputation is being tarnished). We are having more easy access to the numbers and explanations they want us to see. The comforting data. At the end of the day I need more time to feel comfortable taking this. Also, Ivermectin was pulled from the hospitals after a doctor discovered it could cure Covid completely. Yet they aren't telling people that. It is very easy for the media to show us their lense of the situation that benefits them and their pocket book first. I'm glad they pulled Astrazeneca because it shows they are seeing concerning affects already in those who used it supporting both of our views: 1) that they actually care about human survival and 2) my view, that there hasn't been enough time and research to know for sure what is actually a safe vaccine to take.",n3j2rt,2021-05-12 21:05:56
"I think you‚Äôre 100% correct on some of your statements, just wanna clarify a couple points. AstraZeneca was pulled because of some serious blood clotting cases that occurred in a couple hundred recipients. Out over 40 million. That‚Äôs less than .001%. That should show you how careful your government is in distributing the vaccines shouldn‚Äôt it? Some countries would argue the benefits far outweigh the risks, but that‚Äôs up to each government. Again, not some propaganda machine, governments are simply taking precautions that I think are totally acceptable, if not overprecautious.

I don't respect my mom because when my little sister was in still living with her, she would come in drunk with a random at the bar and proceed to have sex in front of my sister so I'm just now experiencing what my sister's have experience most of their lives.

Is all that just believing in a different basketball team?

What op did is not disrespect, it's disagreement.  He dismissed her opinions.  Does he need to accept them because she is his mom.  Go lick a doorknob

"Well, doctors can sometimes be wrong. Just this month, one of my friends was telling me about her chronic headaches. She has a few medical issues, the biggest one being epilepsy. She had shunts put on her brain when she was a baby. The thing about shunts is that when you have them put in as a baby, they are supposed to be revised when you are still a young child. She was supposed to get her revised at the age of 7, but long story short, she went 22 years without a shunt revision. So she told me that and told me about how the neurologist was pretty much saying that nothing was wrong. I told her that if it wasn't anything to do with her epilepsy (which she hasn't had an episode in a while now), then it was the shunt and she should talk to the neurologist. Today she had her neurologist appointment and as it turns out, the shunt on the left side of her brain had gotten infected and has a ton of built-up scar tissue all around it.",n2ppah,2021-05-06 06:18:06

By that point I lost half my vision to the cataract but at least she saved half of it. If it was in their hands I'd have a glass eye. Doctors have agendas they need to push too.

That is actually the problem I have looking into the Anti-VAX stuff, is there are no studies that show vaccines work.
There are plenty that assume they work.
Like Anti-Vaxxers usually talk about how the polio vaccine has caused Polio in India.
There is a study that shows that non-Polio acquired paralysis has actually skyrocketed from the vaccine and is caused by it, and it is far more dangerous than polio was, but the conclusion is that it is not Polio though it has all the symptoms of Polio.
I assume they have done tests to make sure it isn't the Polio virus.

"Well the person is not an antivax but just against vaccine passport to which it's just a bit of a ""red herring"". First of all, it's not uncommon for many to ask for proof of vaccination. In terms of traveling to other countries like in parts of Africa or Asia, you're required to show proof of a yellow fever vaccine. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, you need to show of a polio vaccine and in Saudi Arabia for hajj, you're required to have proof of a meningococcal vaccine. Proof of vaccination are also required to enter schools and universities, for example I was required to show that I took the Yellow Fever and Tetanus vaccine when I enter high school as well as MMR, Hepatitis B, Tetanus and Varicella for university and about employers as well as businesses asking for proof, so what?

They're private business that could literally do whatever they want and we can't complain. Like when businesses place signs that said ""Mask not required to enter"" or ""If you received the vaccine, you can't enter"" as much as I personally disagree, they're allowed to do that.  Why not when required to ask for proof of vaccination? Heck even proof of vaccination are required for employment because all of them want to keep their patrons and employers safe.

"Obviously one of us has actually looked into the law. 

The ADA places restrictions on employers when it comes to asking job applicants to answer medical questions, take a medical exam, or identify a disability.
An employer may not ask a job applicant, for example, if he or she has a disability (or about the nature of an obvious disability). An employer also may not ask a job applicant to answer medical questions or take a medical exam before making a job offer.
An employer may ask a job applicant whether they can perform the job and how they would perform the job. The law allows an employer to condition a job offer on the applicant answering certain medical questions or successfully passing a medical exam, but only if all new employees in the same job have to answer the questions or take the exam.
Once a person is hired and has started work, an employer generally can only ask medical questions or require a medical exam if the employer needs medical documentation to support an employee's request for an accommodation or if the employer has reason to believe an employee would not be able to perform a job successfully or safely because of a medical condition.
The law also requires that the employers keep all medical records and information confidential and in separate medical files.

">Does that change accuracy of the quote somehow?

Oh, no. The quote is still wrong. And the United States itself has proven that time and time again. Like the reference to the Native Americans. Oooor....how about the fact that in the 1940s, suddenly every Japanese-American suddenly had their 'god-given' rights revoked?

Also, bear in mind, the number of your 'god-given' rights vary depending on which country you're in. Some have ten, some have twenty, some have eight....you'd think divinely-granted rights would be consistent.

But hey your free to hate on people you deem as less then you. Will  people look back on your life and say this guy really did his best  hating on those he wished to change? Maybe?

I don't know, considering your repeated misuse of words like 'there' (the proper use in this context is 'their') and 'your' (proper use in this context is 'you're'), I'd say those 'demeaning comments' are a bit of a harsh way of making a perfectly sound point-you are not remotely as informed or as smart as you make yourself out to be.",mz83cu,2021-04-27 22:39:20

Then they deliberately classify any adverse reaction as ""not vaccine related"". And any time a new vaccine is released the response is "" no we didn't double blind placebo teat this on actual humans and actual viruses, that would be unethical"".

You're cherry picking information, or just repeating what's been cherry picked for you.

This is a flaw in the FDAs approval process, and a reason that other countries have an easier time approving new drugs than the United States.

">it has aborted dead baby fetus as one of the ingredients for the J&J vaccine ( it says that on the official website)

>Every vaccine has mercury and alluminium in it ( on the website again for proof)

What website? These are in some vaccines but not the covid ones

>We have been given immunity for a reason. And the old / sick people  should stay home, eat healthy and build antibodies and not just take a  shot, thinking everything is going away.

I'm not sure what you are saying, how will unvaccinated people build antibodies?

>The effects from the shot, are worse than getting COVID and recovering.  Many have even died after taking the shot, and these side effects are  way worse( blood clotting etc..) than if you were to get covid and  recover.

Where did you ear this? The serious side effects of the vaccine are less common than serious or fatal side effects of the virus, covid infection also causes blood clots for some people 

>Getting the vaccine does not mean you will never catch covid again.

No but it reduces the chance a lot (especially the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines)

Fact Check - Social media users have been sharing posts online that claim the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson contains aborted fetal DNA as an ingredient. This claim is false. While the vaccine used **lab-replicated** fetal cells (known as fetal cell lines) during its production process, the vaccine itself does not contain any fetal cells.

"Regarding the al and mercury stuff. The Al in a vaccine is less than your daily intake. A vaccine has less than 1mg of Al, if it has any at all. You take roughly 10mg of Al a day just by living and eating. If you take meds it could go up to 1000mg. 

As for mercury, there's different kinds of mercuries just like there's different types of alcohol.

But afaik neither aluminium not mercury is used in the covid vaccines. 




As for the death rate of vaccines vs covid. 

Let's take J&J and the blood cloth issue for example. 

Right now according to the CDC, 28 people out of 9 million got TTS. Idk if the reported number is those who died or those who got it and survived as well. 

That is 28/9 mil * 100 = a 0.000311% chance of getting TTS. Idk the death rate of TTS but I doubt it's 100%, so the true death rate would be a bit less, but let's assume the worst. 

Death rate by covid is hard to determine, because it heavily relies on the healthcare situation in your area, and of course your age and own health conditions. Let's take the US in general for example though, because we used CDC stats before. 

Reported deaths, directly are around 2000 at ages 18-29. There are roughly 32/33 million citizens aged 18-29 in the US. So the the rough chance of you dying from covid while in that age group is 2000/33 mil * 100 = 0.0061%. That is roughly 20 times more chance than dying from the J&J vaccine. 

These are rough numbers however and there's multiple methods of calculating it. But all in all, COVID's mortality is heavily being downplayed and the vaccines are demonized as killers, but the statistics show otherwise. 

Now that doesn't mean go ahead and go take J&J, a different vaccine might be suited better for you based on your situation. Listen to your doctor in that case and the FDA and see what they advise. I'm just a nobody on the internet and so are most people talking about this stuff. But if we don't know, we should ask those with knowledge.

Covid-19 vaccines have been in extensive trials for nearly a year now and have not come up with major short, medium and long term effects: [Feature Article: Long-term Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccine? What We Know.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

Keep  in mind that there is a definite long term side effect to not getting  the vaccine - in the US it is death for about 2 out of every 100 people  who get it. (1.9% case-fatality ratio)  [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center: Home](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)

So for the long term study you propose, in a place that has community transmission we could project that the death rate from covid in the unvaccinated subset would be around 2%. That's just death, not to mention reduced lung and brain function due to covid.

"Thanks for that nice at-bat.   The last two parts are clever.  Unfortunately they don't directly address the question.  

The links provided try to frame ""long term"" as less than a year which it is not, which is an implicit admission there's no genuine long-term vaccine safety testing.  

Vaccine injury comes from the adjuvant, not the mRNA portion of the vaccine so that part doesn't apply.  

The [chop.edu](https://chop.edu) link was the most intriguing but they don't address the point of my hypothetical either.

The fact is there is no such thing as vaccinated vs unvaccinated double blind placebo-controlled studies like there are with FDA drug approval so my question really is unanswerable.",myd9wp,2021-04-29 03:56:28

"They key line in that link: "" Several vaccine adjuvants have come under fire in the past decade, but most are considered to be safe for use in this application. ""

&#x200B;

Adjuvant chemicals are grandfathered in from old standards.  An example is aluminum as GRAS Generally Recognized As Safe, but old aluminum was elemental aluminum ingested as food, whereas they now use nanoparticularized aluminum injected straight into the blood stream which bypasses the protective mechanism of the digestive system entirely.  The obvious concern for injected nanoparticularized Al would be a) the higher chemical reactivity of the substance compared to elemental Al and b) bypassing the blood-brain barrier and potentially causing autism/parkinson's/alzheimer's/autoimmunity.

(Did you know that in order to induce autoimmunity in test rats there's no better method than injecting them with nanoparticularized aluminum?)

Furthermore the GRAS standard is the basis for why manufacturers perform their short-term comparison studies omitting the adjuvants.  They literally test the relatively inert portions of a vaccine against a placebo.

The GRAS standard is why the article dismisses adjuvants in a one line sentence I quoted above, the same way they are dismissed by manufacturers.

Nowadays they use nanoparticularized lipids in the mRNA vaccines which I suspect is grandfathered in as GRAS as well but I don't know.

&#x200B;

As it always was, the problem with vaccines are adjuvants and nobody has really addressed them except antivaxers.  That's why I pose the question here.

 The article is very well-supported IMO.  An interesting read I don't think would be a waste of time for a thoughtful and discerning person such as yourself.  It has everything I was talking about except for manufacturers using nano-Al to induce autoimmunity in test rats (although it is implied).  Too much text to simply requote everything I was talking about but I'll include this operative quote:

Mystifyingly, aluminum has never experienced biological testing to  consider its safety for being injected into babies, having been  ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù into our modern safety standards. Canadian scientists  Dr. Chris Shaw and Dr. Lucija Tomljenovic addressed this omission in a  critical study they published in 2011 in *Current Medicinal Chemistry* titled, ‚ÄúAluminum Vaccine Adjuvants: Are they Safe?‚Äù They wrote:

>*‚ÄúAluminum is an experimentally demonstrated  neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost  90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science‚Äôs  understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor.  There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and  pharmacokinetics of these compounds.*¬†***In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted.***¬†*Experimental  research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a  potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In  particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity,  long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications  and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences.‚Äù*

I wrote an extensive article in January about the way aluminum‚Äôs  safety has been mismanaged, you can read that article right here:

"Ok so a few things:  
1. I would not consider either of those websites trustworthy. I tried to follow the studies links and they give me a 404 page. Hard to tell without looking at the studies but from the article it looks like a low quality study published in a pay-to-play publication. A 5 subject study may give interesting results that should be investigated further but anything from such a small study is far from conclusive.

2. The Covid-19 vaccines do not have aluminum as far as I can tell. [https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-covid-vaccine-ingredients-idUSKBN2AQ2SW](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-covid-vaccine-ingredients-idUSKBN2AQ2SW)

3. Aluminum is safe in the amounts used for vaccinations: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22001122/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22001122/) 

4. Other adjutants also seem to be safe: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html)

5. Several claims have been made about vaccines causing autism but the science has not proved anything despite many millions of dollars being thrown at it. Wakefield is one example, he was paid handsomely to find a correlation between autism and vaccines and still failed to come up with a logical correlation. That didn't stop him from continuing to profit from other people's pain though and heartlessly blaming parents for causing autism in their children when they did not. Read this book (or find the same data elsewhere) [https://amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Fooled-World-Deception-ebook/dp/B07VXX9589/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=1J3HL0MMN22FA&dchild=1&keywords=the+man+who+fooled+the+world&qid=1620697245&sprefix=the+man+who+foole%2Caps%2C336&sr=8-1](https://smile.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Fooled-World-Deception-ebook/dp/B07VXX9589/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1J3HL0MMN22FA&dchild=1&keywords=the+man+who+fooled+the+world&qid=1620697245&sprefix=the+man+who+foole%2Caps%2C336&sr=8-1)  


I checked out your website. I understand that you feel strongly about this and truly believe what you preach. I know you mean well and are trying to help the people you love. 

I can't find any reputable science that supports your position. If I were you (and of course I am not) I would do extensive research on the scientific process, specifically what constitutes evidence vs testimonials and the different type of bias that scientists try to avoid. I don't at all mean to be condescending, it's hard to communicate well by text only.

It is my **opinion** that certain people (a small percentage) in the alternative medicine space use the ""don't trust mainstream medicine"" line to refute the fact that some of their alternative methods don't hold up under scientific scrutiny. The ultimate endpoint of this is that they end up attacking medical procedures that actually, factually and objectively do work. This is why I think the anti-vaccine mentality is pushed so hard in the alternative medicine space. In looking at who is gaining from this misinformation campaign this is what I have come up with.

"I think the concern here may be that the mRNA may be what's actually being 'shedded' from the vax recipient.  Given the injections allegedly contain up to 5 billion mRNA 'devices' it certainly is possible that some might be expirated out of the lungs.

There are reports that there are non-vaxxed women who are experiencing these very irregular symptoms related to their periods that could be consistent with the possible transmission of mRNA fragments from vaxxed individuals.  We DO know that the spike proteins 'instructions' produced by these mRNA components are capable of being acted upon by ribosomes, and nowhere is it clear that these components, transmitted to a new body would not act in the same manner in the new host.

And while the virus material might be dead, the mRNA fragments are most likely viable upon exhalation from a vaxxed person and, hence, could remain so upon intake by a second person.  And we DO know that the spike proteins DO have hemolytic effects, notably on clotting factors.

We just don't know.  More information, Big Pharma chooses to keep from the masses.  But, until someone comes up with a plausible alternative explanation for this phenomenon, there may be prudence in this caution.",mwttod,2021-04-24 13:24:44

WTF are you talking about? A belief that vaccines give you the virus? No that has nothing to do with infection and viral shedding.

When an individual gets infected by a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2, the virus particles will bind to the various types of viral receptors, particularly the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the case of SARS-CoV-2, that line the respiratory tract.

Throughout this ongoing process, infected individuals, who may not yet be experiencing any of the viral symptoms, are shedding viral particles while they talk, exhale, eat, and perform other normal daily activities.

Under normal circumstances, viral shedding will not persist for more than a few weeks; however, as researchers gain a more in-depth understanding of the viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2, they have found that certain populations will shed this virus for much longer durations.

In fact, a growing amount of evidence indicates that the viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 begins before a patient is symptomatic, peaks at the point of or shortly after symptom onset and can continue to be released even after the individual‚Äôs symptoms have been resolved.",mwttod,2021-04-23 20:10:23
If your infected you have a high chance of shedding the virus. And since you still can be infected after being vaccinated you may be spreading the virus when you go to shop at stores such as the one above. without  having any symptoms. Just like asymptomatic people who haven‚Äôt got the vaccine. Or people who are slick with covid not quarantining.,mwttod,2021-04-23 20:13:10

"Sources please!



people who have been vaccinated against coronavirus have become infected anyway

No source. However this is no surprise. The Pfizer vaccine only is effective in 95% of cases. That's one out of twenty people that it is not effective in. This is why we need everyone to get the vaccine so those who the vaccine is not effective are protected by the herd. 

Source

https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison




7% -- of those who got infected after they were vaccinated required hospitalization.

You provide no source. However if this is true it means that people with the vaccine end up with a less severe reaction than people without the vaccine

Source 

 The new data show 40 percent of diagnosed COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition were hospitalized (including 13 percent in ICU)‚Äîversus 
**9 percent of diagnosed COVID-19 patients without an underlying health condition** (2 percent in ICU).

"Read up on what a breakthrough case means. If you contract covid after getting the vaccine you can spread it to others. The vaccine lessens symptoms it dose not stop you from contracting covid. so you may not even feel sick when you have covid and you can be unknowingly spreading the virus around to others. 

7% of vaccinated people contract covid after all their shots. And we are just seeing breakthrough cases. So if it remains at 7% we still have a good protection not great but good. if it goes higher then that we may want to rethink what getting this vax actually means. I encourage you to look into it what the CDC says about breakthrough cases.",mwttod,2021-04-24 15:35:01
Do you understand what a breakthrough case is? If we vaccinated everyone in the world there will still  be 7% of those vaccinated catching and spreading covid.

Directly above my comment.  If vaccines prevent symptoms but not infection - the viewpoint from which you were arguing - then that would be *even worse* than not being vaccinated because you could be unknowingly spreading the virus.,mwttod,2021-04-23 20:38:26
"I don‚Äôt know how to clearly point this out to you?

-Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can catch it. 

Vaccinated people don‚Äôt show symptoms when infected. 

Unvaccinated people do.  

If you wake up and have flu like symptoms you most likely won‚Äôt feel well enough to go shopping. You will most likely stay at home rest and take care of yourself until you no longer show signs of being sick. Effectively quarantining. 

If your vexed you wake up you have no symptoms of being sick with covid so you go shopping, you go out to eat, you visit your family you go home feeling fine all while spreading the virus. 

Of course this is generalizing it as the cdc has mentioned they are still unaware of how long immunity works for vaccinated and unvaccinated people. 

So what‚Äôs the best thing to do?  

You rather follow what CDC says 

If your vaccinated stay home and quarantine. 

If your not vaccinated stay home and quarantine. 


Or you risk the chance of getting yet another virus - Biologists estimate that 380 trillion viruses are living on and inside your body right now‚Äî10 times the number of bacteria. Some can cause illness, but many simply coexist with you.
 At least that‚Äôs how I feel and I‚Äôm open to talking about what‚Äôs best for the world to have a balance with the microbiol world we live in.",mwttod,2021-04-24 19:50:20
"I think the body is very intelligent. When you get sick you stay home take care of yourself until you no longer feel sick effectively quarantining yourself. 

Trying to change that with vaccines is questionable if infections can still take place and your unable to know by feeling any symptoms. 

No one has a magic ball and we will just have to wait and see.",mwttod,2021-04-24 19:56:22
"That‚Äôs funny because those in medical science are saying what I am saying? So is the cdc denying the effectiveness of vaccines also? Because that‚Äôs where I got my information from. 

Or are you saying you are unwilling to look at the individual and would rather dismiss and label anyone saying something negative weather it was reported scientifically by a *trusted* source or not about the vax as anti vax?",mwttod,2021-04-24 21:28:57
"Well here is updated news from the CDC which hold the same view point I was arguing for. It‚Äôs alright you may not have known about the breakthrough cases showing up. 

Although COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting sick, scientists are still learning how well vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others, even if you do not have symptoms.

people who have been vaccinated against coronavirus have become infected anyway, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells CNN. Some became seriously ill and 74 people died, the CDC said. It said 396 -- 7% -- of those who got infected after they were vaccinated required hospitalization. It's the first indication from CDC of how effective the vaccine is in real life -- and the first indication the vaccines do not protect completely against severe disease and death.

And this is why you see people like the store talking about the potential of shedding.",mwttod,2021-04-23 20:49:53
"I understand that. Asymptomatic infection, it‚Äôs called. However, if you wear a decent-quality mask, you still won‚Äôt spread it.",mwttod,2021-04-24 19:51:24
"...so because it fails for 7% so far your solution is to let not only those people, but also plenty of of other people who would be just fine with a vaccine possibly die?

That‚Äôs some backwards thinking. It‚Äôs like saying not to use condoms because they sometimes break.",mwttod,2021-04-24 20:00:04
"No sources, no CDC link.",mwttod,2021-04-24 20:14:20
Yeah if you properly glue an n95 mask on your face like surgeons then sure there‚Äôs almost no chance you can spread anything! But let‚Äôs be honest people who are getting the vax are doing so to go back to normal and stop wearing masks and socially distancing.,mwttod,2021-04-24 20:00:50
"I don‚Äôt have a solution for anyone. You can decide for yourself what you want to do based on the information you can find. 

I am deciding to trust my own immune system until we have better evidence suggesting the vaccine wont compound the problem of creating super spreaders. And if you understand that viruses mutate then it doesn‚Äôt take much to understand if the virus can take hold of 7% of vaccinated people right now what would that look like in a year? Will we need a booster shot ever year? And the question becomes why? If all we are doing is creating more resistance viruses that can infect people who are vaccinated? It a very common problem with antibiotics especially in farm animals.

All valid reasons for me to wait until we understand more about the breakthrough cases.

"Sorry, but the clever overview you think you have of the situation is actually still from a position of ignorance. Allow me to explain why.

The ruling oligarchs have geniuses working for them on the logistics of this Covid Operation. In order to make sure it runs smoothly, they have to employ various psychological techniques to ensure that it goes on as for as long as possible. One of those techniques includes spreading disinformation and lies through their controlled media.

You like to tar all conspiracy 'theorists' with the same brush but it would be wise to understand that not everyone investigating truth is at the same level or accepting of the same ideas. Also, because we are dealing with incredible intellect here from the big boys and we don't know the minutiae of their plans, please understand that sometimes we are working it out as they make their script a reality.

Right now, yes the word is that people who have been around the vaccinated are getting ill. Now this could be the planned intention of the vaccines apart from killing off thousands and injuring hundreds of thousands, which they have already done if you were paying attention, or it might be a disinformation campaign to divide and conquer. It's not that we all believe the same thing. Some of us are weighing up the evidence while you are just arrogantly stating that we all represent opinion X or Y. The situation reversal does sound like something the powers-that-shouldn't-be would concoct but the question is whether it's a psy-op or they've actually programmed the vaccines to do such a thing.

Incidentally, herd immunity is not achieved from dangerous synthetic junk being put into everybody's arms, it happens when the virus passes through populations and gets weaker as our bodies build resistance to the pathogen. That you believe their blatant bastardization of the term thanks to vaccine company propaganda is as a another example of the brainwashing.

And yes, the fact that you daft system believing numpties are still wearing masks and social distancing despite the multiple promises of freedom which never came even after you all took a double dose of a dangerous vaccine, should tell you everything you need to know about the power of your masters. How many teenage mutant ninja variants are around now? How many masks do you have to wear? How many additional vaccines has master Gates told you have to take? How many booster shots? Honestly, you call it 'conspiracy' but you just have to understand how vaccine companies, who pay out billions in reparations for their lies and murder, operate.

It goes above that though because this is also about depopulation and the introduction of the 'Great Reset', a eco/techno-fascist Orwellian nightmare system of full spectrum dominance through bio-security. It's not a conspiracy theory either as many countries have signed up to it and if you go to the World Economic Forum's website, they show you how they have plotted the future of the world to come. 

Oh and Hollywood is a propaganda arm of government. The China killer virus has been predictively programmed to us all many times through films and series over the last couple of decades and even earlier to prepare us for this time. 'Contagion' in 2011 with it's all star cast, basically was the script for the narrative provided for the Wuhan Covid virus down to a Chinese wet market, bat vector, 'social distancing', mutant strains and a saviour vaccine. 

 James McConnell writing in Psychology Today notes, ""I believe the day has come when we can combine sensory deprivation with drugs, hypnosis and astute manipulation of reward and punishment to gain absolute control over an individual's behavior. It should then be possible to achieve a very rapid and highly effective type of positive brainwashing that would allow us to make dramatic changes in a person's behavior and personality"" (McConnell,April 1970: 14).

Regarding Hollywood, it's just ignorance again:

  We have recently acquired 4,000 new pages of documents from the Pentagon and CIA through the Freedom of Information Act. For us, these documents were the final nail in the coffin.  These documents for the first time demonstrate that the US government has worked behind the scenes on over 800 major movies and more than 1,000 TV titles.  The previous best estimate, in a dry academic book way back in 2005, was that the Pentagon had worked on less than 600 films and an unspecified handful of television shows.  The CIA‚Äôs role was assumed to be just a dozen or so productions, until very good books by Tricia Jenkins and Simon Willmetts were published in 2016. But even then, they missed or underplayed important cases, including *Charlie Wilson‚Äôs War* and *Meet the Parents*.  Jon Voight in Transformers ‚Äî in this scene, just after American troops have been attacked by a Decepticon robot, Pentagon Hollywood liaison Phil Strub inserted the line ‚ÄòBring em home‚Äô, granting the military a protective, paternalistic quality, when in reality the DOD does quite the opposite.  Alongside the massive scale of these operations, our new book [*National Security Cinema*](https://www.amazon.com/National-Security-Cinema-Government-Hollywood/dp/1548084980) details how US government involvement also includes script rewrites on some of the biggest and most popular films, including James Bond, the *Transformers* franchise, and movies from the Marvel and DC cinematic universes.  A similar influence is exerted over military-supported TV, which ranges from *Hawaii Five-O* to *America‚Äôs Got Talent*, *Oprah* and *Jay Leno* to *Cupcake Wars*, along with numerous documentaries by PBS, the History Channel and the BBC.  *National Security Cinema* also reveals how dozens of films and TV shows have been supported and influenced by the CIA, including the James Bond adventure *Thunderball*, the Tom Clancy thriller *Patriot Games* and more recent films, including *Meet the Parents* and *Salt*.  The CIA even helped to make an episode of *Top Chef* that was hosted at Langley, featuring then-CIA director Leon Panetta who was shown as having to skip dessert to attend to vital business. Was this scene real, or was it a dramatic statement for the cameras?

"That statement is worthless. If people are against vaccines it's because despite the billions put into covering up the crimes of vaccine companies, the evil spills out and some astute folk are not stupid enough to ignore it.  Perhaps if they just put little bits of the virus in there instead of intentionally mixing it with a cocktail of lethal chemicals and heavy metals that damage our organism, it would work, but since vaccines are a chosen vector of depopulation by the establishment, that's not going to happen.

I mean are you so stupid as to defend a product like Gardasil? 

Incidentally, the Covid 'vaccines' are actually gene driven technology and are far more dangerous than normal vaccines. In fact they are killing thousands and injuring hundreds of thousands as we speak. If you defend the cult of scientism just because, you have been brainwashed exquisitely by the state and those above it.",mvyqn0,2021-04-22 17:02:59

"Your first paragraph is simply false on almost all accounts. Vaccines may contain heavy metals or ‚Äúlethal chemicals‚Äù (knowing where people like you get your info, I assume you‚Äôre talking about the ‚Äúscandal‚Äù around the flu vaccine having mercury/aluminum and formaldehyde in it). Often the heavy metals are adjuvants to heighten your immune response and formaldehyde helps inactivate the virus so it doesn‚Äôt cause disease. They‚Äôre present in virtually harmless amounts. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs difficult to understand about that. 

Also please show me evidence of what vaccine companies are trying to cover up, I‚Äôd love to see it. Because I‚Äôm not convinced this nonsense conspiracy exists. 

Furthermore, what do you think is wrong with Gardasil? Because I‚Äôve gotten my HPV vaccine and I don‚Äôt see any issue. 

I can assure you no one is dying of the fucking COVID vaccine. I‚Äôm in medical school, my mom‚Äôs a nurse. I think I would know at this point. It‚Äôs sad that you‚Äôre pointing fingers at this ‚Äúcult of scientism‚Äù when you are so clearly down the rabbit hole that I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm arguing with you.

1. Vaccine makers are immune from liability

2. Considering the criminal past of vaccine companies

3.history of failed attempts to make coronavirus vaccines

4. No access to raw data from trials and we are still in the trial until 2023 

5. Under-reporting of adverse reactions and deaths

6. The vaccines don‚Äôt stop transmission or infection (  People are catching COVID after being fully vaccinated) 

7. Overall death rate from COVID ( According to the CDC‚Äôs own numbers, COVID has a 99.74% survival rate.) 

8. Bloated COVID death numbers 

9. Fauci and others at NIAID own patents on the Moderna vaccine

I honestly don't even need to present a case. You cognitive dissonance, Semmelweis Effect suffering, brainwashed, vaccine defenders are protecting vaccines AS THEY ARE BEING STOPPED!!! When people you have been trained to call 'conspiracy theorists' to close conversation say they are dangerous, you say they are not, then they are stopped for being dangerous and you STILL CONTINUE TO RANT! You're so programmed by the high priests of science that even when the evil companies stop them (never for the reasons they give) you empty vessels continue defending them!!!

If you didn't get immediate effects, great because 50% of the people that died did so within the first 24 hours. However, don't be so confident because the people with integrity speaking up about the vaccines say there are many ways in which it can harm you in the future.

https://brandnewtube.com/watch/dr-sherri-tenpenny-8-ways-the-covid19-vaccines-can-kill-you_Pmh9uZhGKVRMLUp.html

What I'm flabbergasted by is your incredible stupidity for getting an unproven, hardly tested, rushed, cell-hacking technology 'vaccine'. You sound so confident but in reality you are completely brainwashed to allow this when even the people who make it don't know what it will do (hint: they do really). Idiocracy!! And if it harms you, there's no liability for the proven felons who make the vaccine! And you have the audacity to come on here and attack me...you are not a sentient human being?!!

Your masters in their ivory towers exaggerated the Covid numbers by enticing hordes of healthy idiots to get tested on PCR which produced many false positives. Also, less people will be testing because of the vaccine promise. There are many ways in which they can p-hack the data. Many nurses and doctors don't agree with the obviously rubbish narrative.

Instead the population focused on voting for those that promise them as little taxes to pay as possible instead of preparing for crisis like Taiwan did for the last 20 years. No reason we couldn't have been prepared like them. The positive is our science has produced some very promising tech: mRNA vaccines. Instead of celebrating this massive leap forward, the naked apes look at it as if some demon is manifesting out of a burning bush. We have 4 amazing vaccines produced and approved through regulation in less than a year. We could easily be doing this for half a decade with so much greater massive death and disability that could have dwarfed the bubonic plague. How many people were on the planet at that time compared to the close to 8 billion today and our ability to move around the planet potentially infecting people across the globe in a 24 hrs timeframe?

"Those are concerns that I have heard before, I hope I can help.

I think the first thing you should do is get the information for yourself. Make sure you are getting data from trustworthy sources. Pretty much all of the anti-vaxx talking points have been debunked using easy to understand data and you just need to dig a little to find something that makes sense to a layman. You can search for ""covid-19 vaccine efficacy data"" and ""covid-19 vaccine long term effects"" and see if that gives you the info you need.

**In terms of  efficacy**, the vaccine will greatly reduce your chances of getting infected with Covid-19. If you are not infected with Covid-19 you can‚Äôt transmit it. If you are part of the small minority of people who do get infected your illness will be much milder than it would have been otherwise. [(CDC): Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html)

The Covid-19 vaccine gives your body the ability to fight off the virus. When you get your vaccine your body creates antibodies (the things in your blood that fight viruses and other harmful things) which wait for Covid-19 virus particles and kill them when they enter your body. 

If someone with coronavirus sneezes in your face the virus particles don‚Äôt just evaporate, they may start replicating in your body but will be exterminated by the immunity defense you had built up in getting your vaccination. [Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines may reduce coronavirus transmission](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease)

The current guidance from the CDC for people two weeks after they have gotten both doses of the vaccine is to wear a mask around people who are at increased risk for Covid-19 and to avoid medium or large gatherings. [When You've Been Fully Vaccinated - Covid-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

This makes sense if you take into account that the vaccines are anywhere from 70% to 96% effective and an infection could lead to death. Think about the fact that a single infected person could unwittingly kill several other people - this is why they are being very careful.

**In terms of long term side effects**, Covid-19 vaccines have been in extensive trials for nearly a year now and have not come up with major long term effects: [Feature Article: Long-term Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccine? What We Know.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

See if you can get info on what makes her think there will be long term side effects and what those side effects may be. Otherwise maybe search for the theory that she is talking about to see what is being said. I've found some truly fantastical theories that just need to be analyzed to fall apart.

People can come up with theories about long term side effects but they are only theories until they come up with proof. I can invent and promote a theory that skittles cause cancer but until I come up with some sort of data to back it up it's still just a theory. The ""burden of proof"" is my responsibility because I am making a claim.

Keep up the good fight, you're doing good work.",mueha9,2021-04-21 01:59:36

"This is unfortunate but it seems to be rare and isolated with those who are immunocompromised. This even mentions that the cause is still unknown but it happened to occur after this particular patients second shot, 6 weeks later.

"A little backstory is needed: 
The patient developed skin lesions 6 weeks after his 2nd moderna dose. That would be considered a long delay to show SJS symptoms; 1-3 weeks is the accepted window. Patient was also recently put on Protonix, a heartburn medication with a known, established link to SJS. Also important to note that a SJS reaction does not ‚Äústop‚Äù once you discontinue the offending medication. It has to run its course. The patient also never had an SJS diagnosis confirmed. It was narrowed down to SJS or EM (similar symptoms, but SJS and TEN are no longer considered part of the EM spectrum). Not sure why they didn‚Äôt perform biopsy to confirm differential diagnosis. 

Currently, the only published reports linking Covid and Stevens Johnson Syndrome are of a patient who was hospitalized for drug-induced SJS, contracted Covid 5 days post discharge, and passed away.  A second patient was admitted with Covid, was treated with hydroxychloroquine, developed SJS, and passed away. Unfortunately there is no way to determine if their SJS was caused by the virus or the treatment. 

Vanderbilt University‚Äôs SJS/TEN research program, as well as the Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation both advise that SJS/TEN survivors receive the vaccination. 

I understand this is an antivax sub, but I am an SJS/TEN survivor myself, and have done a lot of research on the syndrome, and it‚Äôs link, if any, to Covid and it‚Äôs treatment and vaccines. The OP Twitter link provided incomplete and incorrect information regarding the subject patient. I am just hoping to give some clarification to the particular case, and SJS‚Äô links to the vaccine in general.

1. Do you believe in the use of other medications for other diseases? (She's not Christian Scientist)

2. Do you believe that Jesus wants us to do what we can to help others?

3. Do you have reason to believe that the vaccine is immoral in anyway even though it was not used with fetal cells?

"1: socializing does help increase immunity as stress and mental illness lowers your immune system. But socializing with people who have known illnesses that can transfer via talking (covid, flu, common cold, etc.) is a less effective way of boosting your immune system considering that viruses mutate and you could kill someone if you interacted with the wrong person while sick. So while she‚Äôs absolutely right, she also dead wrong considering what she says next.
2: the heart does have an electrical field that reaches outside the body, but it‚Äôs 3 feet and you need an electrocardiogram (according to my source of https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/building-the-habit-hero/202011/the-hearts-electromagnetic-field-is-your-superpower (feel free to fact check me to death, I can take it)
3: our immune system is comprised of cells, viruses (not all viruses are bad like not all bacteria are bad), organs, organ systems and bone marrow. Bacteria can be used to train our immune system and help in the production of antibiotics. Fungus is also used in antibiotics (that‚Äôs literally what penicillin is). What is the point?
4. I looked up detoxing mechanism, specifically if a detox could help with illness. What I found was either a site that looked like a mommy blog, how to feel better with a better diet (life style diet change), or something akin to dialysis. So I want a fucking source for that shit because I tried looking it up and didn‚Äôt find shit.

"This might be nitpicking, but the only thing that sticks out to me in your answer is that it is implied that penicillin is created by bacteria. In actuality, penicillin is produced by fungi in the genus Pencillium. Modern production uses a different species than the original discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, but it‚Äôs still produced by fungi. However, there are many other medications that involve bacteria, as it is fairly easy to insert a plasmid containing a gene for a particular chemical into bacteria to increase yield and speed up production. Human insulin, as an example, is often manufactured using this process.

I did about 3 minutes of research to find that it wasn‚Äôt true at all, but I wouldn‚Äôt have done the research I‚Äôd I hadn‚Äôt seen that disinfo. (Lockdowns have saved ~6k in CA and Florida has had more deaths in relation to population).

"Correlation is not causation. 

The below report from the CDC includes an analysis undertaken by Brown School of Public Health covering vaccine safe monitoring among residents of 284 Genesis Skilled Nursing Facilities.

Essentially, they tracked 7-day mortality rates of 24,082 residents, both vaccinated and unvaccinated.

When excluding residents who tested positive for Covid within 20 days prior to the 7-day observation window the mortality rate of those vaccinated was lower than those who were not.

The reports on VAERS are just that, reports. Someone receives the vaccine and later dies and that is all that is reported. An investigation has to follow to determine the cause of death. How old were they? Did they contract Covid prior to receiving the vaccine? What was the general health like? 

There is no link to the deaths reported and the vaccine until it is demonstrated, and that requires a coroner, or similar, to review and conclude.

The below is straight from the CDC:

""Over 189 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through April 12, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 3,005 reports of death (0.00158%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. **A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.** CDC and FDA will continue to investigate reports of adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS.""

**VACCINE MAKERS ARE IMMUNE FROM LIABILITY**

This is not true in my country. However, from a country to another there could be many examples of such immoral clauses. But that doesn't make the vaccine less effective. Today, Covid vaccine has shown a very low proportion of serious side effects.

&#x200B;

**THE CHECKERED PAST OF THE VACCINE COMPANIES**

This part tells that some companies never released a vaccine before. I won't look to see if that is true, this is irrelevant. The only relevant data is: are the vaccines effective? For example, Moderna has produced one of the most powerful vaccines ever made in history - and exploited a technology that can open many doors in the future. If they produced a successful product, their inexperience is irrelevant. For the felony allegation, again I don't know if that's true - but that's a little more relevant.

&#x200B;

 **THE UGLY HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO MAKE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES**

The author would have to prove that the current vaccines don't work or are dangerous. But they mostly have been proven effective and safe already. This is therefore irrelevant.

&#x200B;

**THE ""DATA GAPS"" SUBMITTED TO THE FDA BY THE VACCINE MAKERS**

I had to read this one to understand the point. It seems it's resting on a valid point: the Vaccine Enhanced Disease. This concern is widely considered less important than the urgency of the situation. However, I don't know enough to give any opinion.

&#x200B;

**NO ACCESS TO THE RAW DATA FROM THE TRIALS**

It could be true but this is irrelevant. There are for example 1 million vaccinated people in France. As cynical as it looks, these people are a test on their own. If the vaccine was not effective are was dangerous, we would have known it by now - keeping in mind that the point above is part of that point here - and we know now that it's effective and yet the only serious side effect is only very rare and mostly curable (however people have died).

&#x200B;

**NO LONG-TERM SAFETY TESTING**

False. The vaccine has been tested last year extensively before being released. This very well-known fallacy is based on the ignorance about the testing process, and also why it takes sometimes years to test another vaccine. With the current situation, there was no lack of testing subjects.

&#x200B;

**NO INFORMED CONSENT**

This is a lie. The test phase has been already finished a month ago. Sure, every new data emerging from the vaccination campaign will be added to the current array of data, but this is not a clinical trial.

&#x200B;

**UNDER-REPORTING OF ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DEATH**

This is impossible. In fact, it is proven that the adverse reactions are overly reported. In France, doctors are flooded with the declaration of side effects - most being not related to the vaccine. People are very worried about this vaccine because of the anxiety induced by the proliferation of anti-vaccine on social media, creating paranoia. Strombolis, although very rare with AstraZeneca, was quickly discovered and documented.

&#x200B;

**THE VACCINES DO NOT STOP TRANSMISSION OR INFECTION**

Sure, that's not the point of a vaccine, but it's false nonetheless. Yes, if an ill person sneezes at your face, the chances to be infected are high, and you could be contagious for some time. But, you will never be as infectious as a sick person. You will not feel any infection as your body quickly dismember the intruders. Because you are not sick, you don't cough and sneeze, making you much less capable of infecting other people. The text tries to make this simple and intuitive fact a shocking revelation, as do many conspiracy theorists. Note that I am not even sure that you would be contagious if you were vaccined.

&#x200B;

**PEOPLE ARE CATCHING COVID** ***AFTER*** **BEING FULLY VACCINATED**

Once again, making an intuitively obvious fact look incredible and shocking. Vaccines are not effective at 100%, this data has been published LONG ago on every media. It's only malevolence to ignore this data and pretend this is evidence that vaccines don't work.

&#x200B;

**THE OVERALL DEATH RATE FROM COVID**

I feel we have entered the realm of cheap old and ignorant arguments. Sure it's not the black plague. But the problem is not there. The problem is not to fall sick, it's that everyone falls sick altogether. There are already a lot of people being let without surgery because there is simply no place left in hospitals. We don't want people to die in the hospital's corridor. It's that simple. Why is that simple though process incomprehensible to these people?

&#x200B;

**THE BLOATED COVID DEATH NUMBERS**

Denying reality, but yet a little smarter. If you have 10 co-morbidity and get covid, it's surely not crazy to assume that the co-morbidity did more than the covid to kill the patient. However, this is false. It's as predictably false that to understand that if your parachute doesn't work at skydiving, it's not the failing parachute that kills you, it's the fall. Yes, you can blame the lady who ate too much and glorified obesity on youtube and Facebook, but if covid makes her breathing impossible to the point she dies, the killing factor is not obesity, it's covid. Else, she would have died long before.

&#x200B;

**THE VIRUS CONTINUES TO MUTATE**

I skipped the Fauci stuff, I don't know what Fauci is. Yes, the virus mutates, just like does the flu. There is a new vaccine every year to respond to new flu mutations. Nothing here is an argument against vaccines.

&#x200B;

**CENSORSHIP...AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF SCIENTIFIC DEBATE**

There a lot of debates and research about vaccines. Would an anti-vaxxer debate with a child about what the child could drink? No, if a child wants to drink Vodka, you say no. If the child insists, you discard his non-sense and explain to him that he is wrong. If the child throws a tantrum, you take action and make sure he is safe. The same thing happens with anti-vaxxers. They say non-sense, they throw tantrums, but responsible people don't pay attention because they are not responsible and need adults to make decisions for them.

&#x200B;

**WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SCIENCE?**

There is some western society non-sense. Western society did not get where we are by giving credit to people who introduced non-sense, but by embracing industrial progress that was based on reason and science.

&#x200B;

**Agree or disagree with me; I'll treat you no differently**

The word of the end. Thank you but don't go too far. This guy has blood on his hand, confuses his madness with complex and contrasted alternatives thoughts. There are such things in this debate. Some people think that the consequences of the pandemic, and the terrible death of many people, alone and helpless, are actually not worth sacrificing the economy. This is certainly controversial, but this has the merit to be a more complex and debatable idea. Arguing that vaccines should not be taken, based on falsehood, is not a debatable idea. It must be shut down, not treated like any other idea. These people are the most dangerous part of an epidemy. They probably killed a fair amount of people, and their ideas spread like another disease among the population.",mpiqhx,2021-04-12 21:41:37

"I would normally not respond to an article like this. I am not a doctor so would not take it upon myself to argue with someone on the internet about a subject on which neither of us is an expert. I could easily double check the information on each of the points for myself and discount this as another source of misinformation.

The reason I am writing this is that I was sent this article by someone I really care for and their decisions regarding the vaccine are a life or death matter. They live with several very high risk individuals and a single covid-19 infection in that family is likely to lead to at least 2 deaths.

&#x200B;

**#1: VACCINE MAKERS ARE IMMUNE FROM LIABILITY**

This point has several pieces of information missing.

The first point that is being overlooked is that there are places in the world which are not the United States of America. These vaccines are being given all over the world and there are many countries that do not have this policy in place. The vaccine manufacturers are still delivering their vaccines to those countries despite the lack of protection.

They can be sued in many countries for damages and in the US for misconduct resulting in death or serious injury.

Specifically in the US, if a vaccine maker causes death or serious physical injury due to their willful misconduct they can be sued. The US government can also be sued through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program: [The PREP Act and COVID-19: Limiting Liability for Medical Countermeasures](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10443)

&#x200B;

**#2: THE CHECKERED PAST OF THE VACCINE COMPANIES**

This is a good point. Several of these companies have put profits in front of science and caused terrible harm to their customers.

They have also saved millions of lives. There have been medicines and vaccines developed which have eradicated massively destructive diseases. Polio and measles are rarely heard of these days but were massively destructive before vaccines were available.

[Our World In Data: Polio](https://ourworldindata.org/polio#the-history-of-polio-in-the-us)

[Graph of US Measles Cases | History of Vaccines](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/graph-us-measles-cases)

Putting one‚Äôs life in the hands of any company whose main goal is making money should not be taken lightly. Any company who is willing to spend billions of dollars making anything is going to try to make that money back with a profit and so should not be trusted to do the right thing as a matter of course.

Rejecting every single vaccine and drug developed by all of these companies would cause more harm than good. This is why we have scientific oversight and experts reviewing the results from the studies done. This is why we have constant surveillance of all parts of the vaccine rollout.

Every bad effect of the vaccine is widely publicized because of this oversight ‚Äì have you heard of the blood clots from the J&J vaccine? There were 6 cases out of 6 million doses (one in a million) but I bet you still heard about it, mostly likely from multiple news sources. 

Here is a graph of google searches for ‚ÄúBlood Clot‚Äù, ‚ÄúJustin Beiber‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTaylor Swift‚Äù who released an album 3 days before the CDC published their report: [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-04-12%202021-04-17&geo=US&q=taylor%20swift,blood%20clot,%2Fm%2F06w2sn5](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-04-12%202021-04-17&geo=US&q=taylor%20swift,blood%20clot,%2Fm%2F06w2sn5)

As you can see from that chart, the two biggest stars in the US - one having released an album three days beforehand - were searched less than a one in a million side effect from the least used vaccine in the US.

Every vaccine recipient is monitored for 30 minutes after getting the vaccine and is encouraged to report any and all side effects of the vaccine after that using a purpose-made system to track side effects. This is in addition to other systems already in use to monitor side effects using hospital and insurance data. [COVID-19 Vaccine Reporting Systems](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/reporting-systems.html)

The real question isn‚Äôt who made the vaccine, the real question is whether the vaccine is effective - which it is: [Fact Check-COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be effective, while vaccine efficacy figures are not estimates of survival rates](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaccine-efficacy-idUSL1N2M60JD)

&#x200B;

**#3: THE UGLY HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO MAKE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES**

The first vaccine brought up here is from 60 years ago when regulation was quite different from the present, additionally they were not approved for use. The rest of vaccines that are brought up here were never approved due to the effects they had. 

This is actually the review system working and catching problems with vaccines before they are administered to the public.

I specifically take issue with this point:

*‚ÄúHere's the lingering issue‚Ä¶ The vaccine makers have no data to suggest their rushed vaccines have overcome that problem.‚Äù*

This is false. There is an overwhelming amount of data that the vaccines have overcome this issue. There have been over half a billion vaccines administered by now and there is a huge amount of data showing that they do not initiate a ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù. [Can Vaccines Cause Cytokine Storm? - VAXOPEDIA](https://vaxopedia.org/2020/10/28/can-vaccine-cause-cytokine-storm/)",mpiqhx,2021-04-20 21:16:45
"**#4: THE ""DATA GAPS"" SUBMITTED TO THE FDA BY THE VACCINE MAKERS**

This is actually several points in one:

***‚Äú****They have no idea if the vaccines they've made will also produce the same cytokine storm (and deaths) as previous attempts at such products.‚Äù*

\- this is false, they know that it does not create a cytokine storm based on over half a billion vaccines administered. [Fact check: There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would cause recipients to suffer from a ‚Äòcytokine storm‚Äô](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-cytokine-idUSKBN29Q2UT)

***‚Äú****Anyone younger than age 18 or older than age 55‚Äù,* ***‚Äú****Pregnant or lactating mothers‚Äù, ‚ÄúAuto-immune conditions‚Äù, ‚ÄúImmunocompromised individuals‚Äù*

\- This is an important point, check with your medical professional if you fall into any of these groups ‚Äì don‚Äôt take advice from random people on the internet. Many of the vaccines delivered up to about a month ago in the US were to people over 55 so there should be plenty of data available at this point - check with credible sources for the newest data on these groups as I am sure more data has been/will be released.

This data is now available: [**Real-World Evidence Confirms High Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Profound Public Health Impact of Vaccination One Year After Pandemic Declared**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210311005482/en/)

The vaccine has now been proven to greatly reduce transmission and prevent mortality. The above link is just one of many, you can find the efficacy data readily on the internet.

*‚ÄúNo data on duration of protection from covid‚Äù*

This data is coming, there isn‚Äôt a way to get it without waiting. We know that it lasts at least 6 months (and probably longer): [Pfizer and BioNTech Confirm High Efficacy and No Serious Safety Concerns Through Up to Six Months Following Second Dose in Updated Topline Analysis of Landmark COVID-19 Vaccine Study | pfpfizeruscom](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious)

We have to wait and see if booster shots are needed.

**#5: NO ACCESS TO THE RAW DATA FROM THE TRIALS**

There does not seem to be access to the raw data from the trials - at least not to the doctor who wrote the piece that was linked in the article. There was raw data available to the FDA when they approved the vaccines.

This is not relevant to the efficacy at this point - with entire countries vaccinating their populations it is easy to find current and accurate efficacy data: [COVID-19 Vaccines Work](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html#Related2)

&#x200B;

**#6: NO LONG-TERM SAFETY TESTING**

Covid-19 vaccines have been in extensive trials for nearly a year now and have not come up with major long term effects: [Feature Article: Long-term Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccine? What We Know.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

Keep in mind that there is a definite long term side effect to not getting the vaccine - in the US it is death for about 2 out of every 100 people who get it. (1.9% case-fatality ratio)  [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center: Home](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)

&#x200B;

**#7: NO INFORMED CONSENT**

This point does not make sense. He doesn‚Äôt seem to know what a clinical trial is: [What Are Clinical Trials and Studies? | National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies)

He also seems to insinuate that the FDA is hiding adverse reactions and continuing to distribute a dangerous vaccine. This is false based on the following:

There were 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine and out of those there were 6 women who got blood clots 6 to 13 days after the vaccination -  less than one in a million - and the FDA halted all vaccinations using the J&J vaccine for the US and published a detailed article explaining exactly what happened and what they are doing to investigate: [Joint CDC and FDA Statement on Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine)",mpiqhx,2021-04-20 21:17:58
"**#8: UNDER-REPORTING OF ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DEATH**

The Harvard study linked is about a specific reporting system and was done 11 years ago. There are now multiple reporting systems in place and adverse reactions are very heavily monitored. [COVID-19 Vaccine Reporting Systems](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/reporting-systems.html)

He also states that there are 2,200 deaths from the covid 19 vaccine. This is false. There were 2,200 deaths following the patient receiving the covid 19 vaccine. This does not mean that the vaccine caused the death of the patient, only that there was a patient who got the vaccine who also died within a certain amount of time. 

A certain number of people die every day no matter what. If you take any group of elderly or high risk individuals (the people who were getting the vaccine first) there is a high probability that some will die each day. As the number of people in your group increases so will the number of deaths. In order to get real data out of this you have to look into each of the deaths and determine whether it was caused by the vaccine or was unrelated to the vaccine.

This is explained well here: [International interest about deaths following coronavirus vaccination](https://www.fhi.no/en/news/2021/international-interest-about-deaths-following-coronavirus-vaccination/)

Same applies to adverse effects. The CDC is closely monitoring everyone who gets a vaccine and any adverse reactions are recorded. This is whether they are from the vaccine or not. [V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html)

There are known side effects to the vaccine:

On the arm where you got the shot:

* Pain
* Redness
* Swelling

Throughout the rest of your body:

* Tiredness
* Headache
* Muscle pain
* Chills
* Fever
* Nausea

(from CDC [Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html))

The fact that there are side effects being recorded is a good thing, it shows that the recording system is working and can be used to find patterns and any adverse reactions quickly, so that serious reactions can be prevented (as in the case of the blood clots from the J&J vaccine).

With regards to the line about 578 cases of Bell‚Äôs Palsy, the page he linked to shows the stats for more than just Bell‚Äôs Palsy. It includes all of the following conditions: ‚ÄúBell's palsy, Facial discomfort, Facial dysmorphism, Facial nerve disorder, Facial neuralgia, Facial palsy, Facial paralysis, Facial paresis, Facial spasm‚Äù

With regards to the death data, he takes the fatality data that he misrepresented earlier and multiplies it by 100 to come up with 110,000 to 220,000 deaths that are being covered up as well as a ‚Äúridiculous number of adverse reactions (my calculations would put it at 5,086,100). This is simply made-up data, there is no credible data that the adverse reactions are currently being under-reported, if anything they are being monitored more heavily than ever before.

&#x200B;

**#9: THE VACCINES DO NOT STOP TRANSMISSION OR INFECTION**

This is misleading. The vaccine will greatly reduce your chances of getting infected with Covid-19. If you are not infected with Covid-19 you can‚Äôt transmit it. If you are part of the small minority of people who do get infected your illness will be much milder than it would have been otherwise. [(CDC): Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html)

The Covid-19 vaccine gives your body the ability to fight off the virus. When you get your vaccine your body creates antibodies (the things in your blood that fight viruses and other harmful things) which wait for Covid-19 virus particles and kill them when they enter your body. 

If someone with coronavirus sneezes in your face the virus particles don‚Äôt just evaporate, they may start replicating in your body but will be exterminated by the immunity defense you had built up in getting your vaccination. [Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines may reduce coronavirus transmission](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease)

The current guidance from the CDC for people two weeks after they have gotten both doses of the vaccine is to wear a mask around people who are at increased risk for Covid-19 and to avoid medium or large gatherings. [When You've Been Fully Vaccinated - Covid-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

This makes sense if you take into account that the vaccines are anywhere from 70% to 96% effective and an infection could lead to death. Think about the fact that a single infected person could unwittingly kill several other people - this is why they are being very careful.

&#x200B;

**#10: PEOPLE ARE CATCHING COVID** ***AFTER*** **BEING FULLY VACCINATED**

People who are fully vaccinated are 70% to 90% less likely to get infected:

[Interim Estimates of Vaccine Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w)

[Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Among](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011e3.htm?s_cid=mm7011e3_)

This has been widely published, I have seen nothing saying that once you get the Covid-19 vaccine you are 100% immune from all forms of the Covid-19 virus.

Even using the lowest efficacy data this means that out of 100 million people who get the vaccine we have immunized 70 million people against a virus which has never infected a human earlier than 1.5 years ago. That is quite an accomplishment and will reduce transmission and save thousands of lives.

With regard to the ‚Äú80% of 35 nuns‚Äù who caught Covid-19 (I did the math for you, that‚Äôs 28 nuns) this is tragic and just shows how we need to eradicate this virus before it causes any more death and destruction. Glaringly omitted from his description is that they had only recently gotten their first dose of the vaccine and were not fully vaccinated, still needing the second dose and the two weeks after to generate the needed immunity.

"**#11: THE OVERALL DEATH RATE FROM COVID**

The 99.74 survival rate did not come from the CDC. It may have come from a random tweet. [Fact-check: Does CDC release COVID-19 survival rates?](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/fact-check-does-cdc-release-covid-19-survival-rates/ar-BB1cbfUZ)

The fatality rate of Covid-19 infection has gone up and down over time with the amount of cases, testing and availability of care. It looks like it averages around 1.8% or so. [COVID-19 Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-14..latest&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&hideControls=true&Metric=Case+fatality+rate&Interval=Cumulative&Relative+to+Population=false&Align+outbreaks=true&country=~USA)

Different ages and pre-existing conditions have different survival rates. You not dying from the virus does not mean that you won‚Äôt infect someone who is older than you or has a pre-existing condition. You are most likely to spread the virus to someone in your home or a social gathering so if you infect someone, and they die it will probably be a family member or a friend. [The 7 Most Common Places COVID-19 Is Spreading Right Now](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/most-common-places-covid-spreading_l_5fd778cec5b62f31c1ff042b)

&#x200B;

**#12: THE BLOATED COVID DEATH NUMBERS**

This is false on a few levels. If you have underlying conditions you are much more likely to die from Covid-19, therefore most of the people dying from Covid-19 have underlying conditions. 

This is the same for many illnesses and injuries. If a 20 year old falls down the stairs they will probably get a few bruises. On the other hand if a 70 year old falls down the same stairs they are more likely to break a bone or worse. Would you say they died of old age or falling down the stairs?

This information comes from a misunderstanding of a report filed by the CDC showing that only 6% of Covid-19 deaths had no other comorbidities. This is explained well here:

[Fact check: CDC not inflating COVID-19 deaths](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/02/16/fact-check-cdc-not-inflating-covid-19-deaths/6764078002/)

**#13: FAUCI AND SIX OTHERS AT NIAID OWN PATENTS IN THE MODERNA VACCINE**

The active patents Dr. Fauci owns are for HIV treatments. His data seems to taken from a debunked conspiracy theory: [Conspiracy theorist spreads false claim about Fauci, patents and COVID-19](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/12/jerome-corsi/conspiracy-theorist-spreads-false-claim-about-fauc/)

The NIH does have joint ownership of the Moderna vaccine. This is due to Moderna using some patents that NIH scientists developed before the Covid-19 virus was sequenced. This allows the government to have more control over the production of the Covid-19 vaccine and Moderna to use those patents in developing their vaccine. This is explained well here: [The NIH claims joint ownership of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine](https://www.axios.com/moderna-nih-coronavirus-vaccine-ownership-agreements-22051c42-2dee-4b19-938d-099afd71f6a0.html)

&#x200B;

**#14: FAUCI IS ON THE HOT SEAT FOR ILLEGAL GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH**

The research was not illegal and was fully approved by the US State department and the NIH.

From msn.com: ‚ÄúIn 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the part of the NIH headed by Fauci, awarded a $3.4 million grant to the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to protect people from viruses that jump from species to species.

‚ÄúThe group hired the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct genetic analyses of bat coronaviruses collected in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest of Wuhan. EcoHealth Alliance paid the lab $598,500 over five years. The lab had secured approval from both the U.S. State Department and the NIH.‚Äù [No, Dr. Anthony Fauci did not fund research tied to COVID 'creation'](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/fact-check-did-dr-fauci-fund-research-that-created-covid-19/ar-BB1dxmhg)

&#x200B;

**#15: THE VIRUS CONTINUES TO MUTATE**

This virus just like any other virus will continue to mutate. The more people who have active Covid-19 infections the more variations will be created of the virus. This is in fact a major reason that widespread vaccination is important. 

Despite the several current variants that have mutated, the Covid-19 vaccine is still very effective against most of the new variants and slightly less effective against some of them. [Pfizer jab may not be as potent against B.1.351 variant](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pfizer-jab-may-not-be-as-potent-against-b-1-351-variant)

Seatbelts and airbags are much more effective against certain car accidents and not very effective against other car accidents - does that mean we should stop wearing seatbelts and using airbags altogether? No. it means we need to continue to update the seat belt and airbag design as we learn more about accidents.

Same idea applies to vaccines. Every year the projected new flu virus strains are developed into a vaccine and you are able to get a current flu shot with the newest strains available. This will most likely be done with the Covid-19 virus until it is eliminated.

"**#16: CENSORSHIP...AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF SCIENTIFIC DEBATE**

I‚Äôm not sure what he is referring to here with regards to debates. There has been plenty of debates about all the subjects he is saying were not debated:

[https://www.google.com/search?q=lockdown+debate](https://www.google.com/search?q=lockdown+debate&sxsrf=ALeKk022ZktO-liMq-WNYLjEnBnlkbvIHg%3A1618853057105&source=hp&ei=wbx9YLDoA7CRggeN07PQBA&iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAYH3K0WZKL5DOItSl4UmGFIf5DKNYf-rt&oq=lockdown+debate&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyAggAMgIIADIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB46BAgjECc6CAgAELEDEIMBOgsILhCxAxDHARCjAjoFCAAQsQM6CAguELEDEIMBOgIILjoFCC4QsQM6BwgjEOoCECc6DgguELEDEIMBEMcBEKMCOggILhDHARCjAjoLCC4QsQMQgwEQkwI6CwguELEDEMcBEK8BOggIABCxAxDJAzoFCAAQkgM6CAguEMcBEK8BOggILhCxAxCTAjoFCAAQhgNQlAhYhVVgvVdoA3AAeACAAX-IAd8NkgEEMTAuOJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXqwAQo&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjwzKPL6YrwAhWwiOAKHY3pDEoQ4dUDCAg&uact=5)

But debates don't change real life data. There have been thorough reviews of each step of the care methodology and vaccine development as we went through in all the points above.

With regard to censorship and first amendment rights, he does not seem to understand the first amendment: 

*‚ÄúCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.‚Äù*

Congress did not remove misleading posts from Facebook and Twitter (and others). The companies who pay for the servers, software and bandwidth have a right to decide what goes on those servers and if they decide to remove something from their own websites they are not violating the first amendment. In fact, if Congress forced them to allow speech on their platform which they did not want to publish it would be their rights which are violated.

The scientific debate he is requesting must have science on both sides. Both sides must have well researched data that holds up to scrutiny. I have just gone through his mix of misleading information and conspiracy theories and each one has fallen apart with very little research.

There is an ongoing debate with scientists on both sides working to get to the truth. You can see this in the data and guidance changing as we get more information about this new virus we have never seen before. 

We started without masks, now we are wearing masks. [Still Confused About Masks? Here‚Äôs the Science Behind How Face Masks Prevent Coronavirus](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent)

We used to wipe down everything before it came into our house, now we don‚Äôt. [COVID: Do you still need to wipe down groceries, takeout food boxes?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/08/do-you-still-need-wipe-down-grocery-store-takeout-boxes/5743240002/)

These are just two of the major things we have learned about this virus over the past year.

If someone was promoting removing seatbelts and airbags from cars, it would be smart to check what they are saying to see if there is a problem with the seatbelts and airbags they are talking about. If you checked their data and it proved to be incorrect you would not take it seriously. It would in fact cause harm for you to promote their incorrect views and tell people not to wear seatbelts and use airbags. Per the first amendment you cannot stop them from spreading the dangerous and false information to people who trust them. On the other hand you have no obligation to promote their views if you think they are wrong.

There is hardly censorship of opposing views. There are thousands of websites and groups that have all sorts of views of which none are being taken down or blocked by the government. You simply cannot force someone else to put something on their website that they don‚Äôt want to put on it.

In his ‚ÄúOpen letter‚Äù he makes speculations about the vaccine causing the virus to mutate. This is the opposite of what happens. By letting the virus run wild we allow it to mutate more, by cutting down transmission and increasing immunity we reduce the number of actively mutating viruses in the world and thereby decrease the total number of mutations.

It's not the first time the criminals at the FDA, CDC, WHO etc have lied to get dangerous vaccines into as many people as possible.

Sounds familiar to me.....

Like ""we just ... follow the orders"" or something of a kind. But I can't remember where I heard it, maybe you do?

""We aren't paranoid""....

Ok, let's start with a definition, what being paranoid means

""Exhibiting or characterized by extreme and irrational fear or distrust of others. ""

So, now let's take someone who wears double-mask after being vaccinated, and snitching on those who doesn't.

Extreme and irrational fear... If double-masking yourself after getting vaccinated doesn't sound ""extreme or irrational"", give it a second thought. And try to find an example when something similar happened in your lifetime against virus with 99+% survival rate.....

Distrust of others.... When you see people not wearing mask, what's your first thought? Probably this person is healthy and doesn't want harm anyone? ... Or maybe you thought would be more like ...

And as for why it was marginally lower, that's mostly because Sweden is a much less dense country with fewer large, tightly packed cities. That actually makes an incredibly big difference.

But yes, if you take all areas including wild nature Sweden has less density. but anyway no one stopped them from travelling and seeing each other in any part of Sweden, while in UK people were lock down and could not leave their houses.

I haven't gotten mines either, but that does not mean that I am not concerned regarding these ""developments"".  Keep in mind that there is ZERO long term data regarding any of these vaccines, anyone that takes these vacines are gambling that nothing it going to come out of it in the long term.  what about those that have gotten vaccinated and has not experienced any issues so far ends up experiencing issues down the road, perhaps many many years later, what about if the vaccine is the causes why someone who took it as 20 years old ends up dying at 40 to 50 years old due to some condition that showed up due to ""that vaccine"", when that person would have lived just fine till 80+ years old had that person not taken that vaccine?

I am not against these coronavirus vaccines, I am just a believer that any vaccine needs time, enough time, and trials to make sure they are as safe as it can get.  None of the other conventional vaccines that we have today ever showed up for general public use without at least 5 to 10+ years of pure scientific studies, trials, tweaks, ""scratch-that-and-back-to-the-drawing-board - scenarios"" taking place.

"While there are studies on antivaxers, usually they look at patterns of their behaviour and clustering certain traits into groups. Usually because studies need to answer a question or at the least be able to convince some party or funder there is a purpose to spending money and time on a question. There's money on finding out how to convince anti vaxers, not much money on finding if they are good researchers.

As far as I'm aware no groups have the capacity nor the need to perform massive scale survey of anti vaxers population along with general sentiment and various traits like health literacy or behavioural patterns with information gathering.

We do see small cross sectional studies but that doesn't really give us much that we can extrapolate with to assume anything about the larger population of anti vaxers.

But this is also one of those things that don't need a study. Vaccine science is as robust as any other modern science based on observation and repeated confirmation studies. If they looked at credible source and studied actual immunology they wouldn't be able to hold their anti vax stance, so the question is a bit of a paradox. 
By being Anti vax they are already going against good science with decades of proof. So it is inherently illogical to suggest they did good research before arriving to the conclusion of anti vax. That's like asking if anti gravity theorists read well sourced and trustworthy studies before making up their mind. It's an inherent contradiction

Tldr. As far as I know, there isn't any comprehensive study or survey that asks those questions to a group large enough for us to make any judgements about percentage most of our info is on types of anti vaxers personality/sentiment/argument. It would be incredibly costly, highly likely to be biased with various confounding variables thus not too useful.
But overall anti vax is inherently taking good science and denouncing it, so if they read trustworthy science then they couldn't reach conclusion of anti vax.",mlsprc,2021-04-07 04:35:51
Every one I've known only uses Facebook and weird alt right websites. I've never found a legit anti vax source except maybe VAERs but that's just real side effects and not conspiracies,mlsprc,2021-04-07 05:30:09
"Years ago I was an antivaxer, back then I mostly got vaccine info from antivax websites, not social media, and not the right wing conspiracy sites that seem to be so popular now",mlsprc,2021-04-07 14:16:54
"In fact vaccines do have side effects that can change a persons life for the worst, and anti vaxers ignore the fact the the good of vaccines far outweigh the bad. In my opinion, there are some anti vaxer that have good reasons, and of course there are those karens that are convinced easily by Facebook articles.",mlsprc,2021-04-07 04:44:09
"VAERS is a site where people can submit reports of adverse side effects from vaccines. 
They are claims, and the CDC investigates each claim to work out if there is a causal relationship between the vaccine and the effect.",mlsprc,2021-04-07 07:55:30
"The problem with VAERS is anyone can submit anything, whether it was caused by a vaccine or not (or whether it happened or not). Which means it is entirely unreliable.",mlsprc,2021-05-10 12:36:49
"And of course, I recently saw a vasculitis secondary to mmr vaccine due to the patient having a very rare autoimmune disorder.

That's the reality of any widespread implementation of medication, which a vaccine is. There is always a small risk of anaphylaxis, of rare conditions.
But like you said, we do it because statistically it has literally saved more lives than almost any other public health policy/reform. 

When people shout vaccines can be dangerous, they aren't wrong. But I can also shout gravity will kill all of us (IF we are standing 1km above the ground on a collapsing bridge), but context is key.
Whether risking the 1 in ~100,000 (massive variance depending on the type of vaccine) so we can go from 40% of your children dying to less than 1% is ethical or not is another question, and that is like you said is a very valid topic of discussion.

But I'm a doctor, my team are health practitioners, we make a vow to serve the patient in front of us. We don't care of method or reason (which we know now after years of research, innoculations we're done for years before we knew anything about how or why it worked), we do what works, that's been medicine for the longest time until of late when we found evidence based medicine. So for us, there is no question, no dilemma, we do what will save more lives. That's our job.",mlsprc,2021-04-07 05:06:25

Enjoy rioting. FYI correlation is not proof of causation and covid 19 as a coronavirus would be expected to see seasonal variations like with the common cold.

None of this is a judgement about you because how could I possibly judge you based on two paragraphs of text.  You can take some comfort in know that if it turns out your right me and the people I care about will die of blood clots and be stricken with autism or whatever. 

3.) Are you suggesting that there is no such thing as cold season.  [https://www.verywellhealth.com/when-is-common-cold-season-770443](https://www.verywellhealth.com/when-is-common-cold-season-770443)

4.) If you think that correlation is clear evidence of causation, then I have some troubling facts that big ice cream doesn't want you to know.   

[https://www.egenerationmarketing.com/blog/causation-and-correlation-for-a-law-firm](https://www.egenerationmarketing.com/blog/causation-and-correlation-for-a-law-firm)

5.) Why do cases peak in Jan even as vaccination rates continue to increase \~linearly?  If the vaccine is responsible for the spread wouldn't infections increase with vaccinations?

6.) Why do you see increases in new cases in Germany and France that correspond with the beginning of the vaccine trials?

7.) What makes you believe that the virus mutations/variants are caused by the vaccine and not normal mutation and why have the number of variants not exploded as the UK went from 0.1% vaccination in December to 47.4% vaccination today.

8.) Is something a conspiracy if it is a legal action taken openly by private entities?  Google does not deny directing traffic on covid-19 to reliable sources and excluding what it has deemed to be unreliable, at leas in the US, courts have upheld their right to do so.  There are alternatives to google (i.e. duck duck go) that will not perform these types of action.

"1) ok 

2) i dont know you but youre brainwashed

3) there have been zero cases of influenza recorded in 2021 (UK)

4) its interesting that you want to talk about causation because i am a lawyer and in law, the chain of causation is broken when you provide a patient with drugs/medical intervention because then the consequence of those drugs is not relevant to the patients prior state, you did not read the article properly as it was taking the piss out of the fact that ice cream is a food and is not a health concern could be used by advocates to claim a break in the chain of causation where causation has expressly been used in cases where the medical intervention was novel/untested such as *vaccines.* which is the exact thing i say to people who say but maybe it wasn't the vaccines fault my granddad died so weve just gone full circle on the vaccine argument there

5) a) your question is not coherent. b) no scientist or politician can answer what you are asking. c) you are willing to accept advice that the rates of OG COVID-19 will just taper off as natural fact but question that the mutations which we have done no research into will do the same. i recommend you stop seeing yourself as an individual agent in nature as what the pandemic has showed us is that we are all mere pawns in a symbiotic system which much surpasses the might of one man :'(

6) ""Why do you see increases in new cases in Germany and France that correspond with the beginning of the vaccine trials?"" - is the exact point that i was making, well done. 

7) see point 5. you don't understand science. when you start manipulating the human genome to make it resistant to disease what you will see is mutations at which point will become airborne and work their way into the ground and water and then our food. we will all become to some degree resistant to the diseases because mutations happen in no mans land if you like, its complex, read a book. 

8) your last point is so obtuse i can't even begin... google is the most widely used search engine. it's all social media that has the firewall. as populations have been locked down we have turned more and more to social media to try and replace the social deficit we have been experiencing. we are being deliberately kept from the information because lobbyists work in tandem. google etc and pharma are incentivised by the success of the other with the larger aim of keeping government in and taxes low. ""what it has deemed to be unreliable"" - do you believe in free speech? because we're not living in it.",mlo89o,2021-04-09 16:51:20
"I'll just recap and clarify.  Your original post makes a claim and uses the data on new cases to support the hypothesis.  I am saying that this is a very weak argument because your only evidence is a correlation between vaccine trials and roll out with increases in cases.  If your hypothesis was correct and vaccines are responsible for the increases then when vaccination increases I would expect to see corresponding increases in new cases and mutation (variants).  Vaccine rates have been increasing pretty much linearly since December but the rate of new cases per day peaked in January so the data does not match what would happen if your hypothesis was correct.  If Vaccines were responsible for the increase I also would not expect to see increases at the same time in countries where vaccine roll out and trials occurred at different times.  If I see the same effect in countries where the population has not yet been vaccinated then it would seem that there is a non vaccine cause of the change that is common to France, Germany, and UK (i.e. Colder temperatures leading to an expected seasonal increase in cases).  So the increases in France and Germany which started vaccination later demonstrates my point that the changes you point out are more likely due to seasonal changes and the changes in habits that go with them then to the roll out of the vaccine. Even better look at numbers from australia where the seasons are flipped you see increases starting in may when the weather gets colder and lowering as they enter their warmer months. Basically the data does not match what we would expect to see if your hypothesis was correct.  Even if you were right, your point as you made it would still be based on extremely weak evidence that would only convince someone who was already just aching to eat the bullshit you are serving up.  If you wanted to convince anyone you would not immediately tell people who question what you are saying that they are just brainwashed but you don't want to convince anyone you want a circle jerk.... or your trolling (if so good job).

There is so much wrong with what you said in 7.  The vaccine does not alter your genome, The AZ vaccine is built like a traditional vaccine, and even if it where the mRNA type it would not alter your genome RNA and DNA are different.  Obviously one of us is brainwashed and is unlikely to persuade the other.

I was just dicking around about google because you only bring them up as a deflection anyway but they are not hiding their censorship.  Like I said if you are against what they are doing there are alternatives to google that are specifically set up to address the exact concerns you are talking about.  I'm not sure why you would complain about them instead of using those alternatives.

Hold on, you actually answered that one for me.....because you actually said "" How many people do you know that even know about VAERS? ""

Guess what, dumb dumb. The average person does not report directly to VAERS. The doctors and medical professionals treating the person do that. So, if a person drops dead, the medical examiner asks for a history, and if in the history they say 'they recently got a vaccine', that medical professional is required BY LAW to submit that report to VAERS.

"I'm humouring you at this stage.

It's not arrogance when I say that I know I'm right and you are wrong on this one. You can have the next one, okay? I can see evil and you clearly cannot even when it's raping you of your last natural freedoms like the right to breathe fresh air. Even when people in the thousands are being injured and killed by a synthetic genetically engineered bullet coming through a needle that you are told is experimental and has never been tested at all in the medium and short term.

The Covid death numbers were nowhere near what they said they were but people did die, many because the oligarchs who pre-planned the whole Covid scheme made sure that medicines like the ones advertised by our friends in the videos I posted, were suppressed. Did you hear anything about other immune system boosting ideas from government like D3, C, Zinc or Quercetin for at risk groups? No, they locked people away from getting essential D3 from sunlight and when allowed out of their cages, forced muzzles on their faces to stop their normal breathing. It's absurd. So you can't bring up Covid death numbers because there wouldn't be any if the government/media/de facto rulers of earth had allowed Nobel prize winning Ivermectin and other medicines to be used! Only a small fraction of people that they said died of Covid actually did, the rest were people who died WITH Covid, or because the were forced on ventilators which they knew was a death sentence or because they were euthanized in care homes by do not resuscitate orders or because they were put down as dying of Covid because the PCR gave a false positive...the list of corrupt and evil ways that the elite got those numbers is endless. Did you question the real reason why no autopsies were being permitted?

And how many people have lost everything including their lives from the lockdowns? Millions is the answer and a hell of a lot more than from Covid which even the mainstream media has admitted in places. Now, with a pathogen that is basically gone and no teenage mutant ninja variants actually out there because that was a crappy narrative that only children would believe, let's stab everyone with experimental junk that has been knocking off the elderly en masse.

In answer to your 'fun' question, I trust what Peter McCullough or Pierre Kory are saying because they have nothing to gain and everything to lose from speaking out against this 'Voldemort' subject. Almost anything negative said about the Covid narrative, lockdowns or the vaccines has been blacked out by the controlled world media. You cannot question the subject and if you are a doctor, nurse, scientist, teacher etc and you do, you're out. There has never been such an organized censorship of information across the board. Hitler, or Churchill for that matter would have salivated at such a level of Orwellian information control. 

Also there are scientific papers hidden away on the internet that back up their claims.

You believe the words of one doctor...mafioso demon, Fauci, who for some reason you allow to speak for all the millions of doctors who you seem to know personally and claim are all backing the narrative. Not true. Many will disagree but have been trained to toe the party line, many have been taught that all vaccines are great without ever needing to learn about them, many go along to get along, a relative few are ignoring their higher ups and are actually trying to heal people and even less are quitting because of moral fortitude. Have you done any research on J D Rockefeller's allopathic takeover of the medical establishment and suppression of what he coined 'quacks'?

I'm not saying everyone involved is a bad guy but when the people at the top wish to promote an idea or system, you'd better believe that it's easier than you think. They were great at it before they had ARPA/DARPA create the internet to monopolize data (or are you under the impression that the only search engine people use is not under government control.....naivete), but now it's really difficult to find alternative voices. Since Covid started, they paid billions to set up hundreds of fact checking sites to sway the minds of the hoi polloi...that's you.

You said: Guess what, dumb dumb. The average person does not report directly to VAERS. The doctors and medical professionals treating the person do that.

Hmm..then why on the VAERS site would it say: 'VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including parents and patients.'

or

VAERS accepts reports from anyone. Patients, parents, caregivers and healthcare providers (HCP) are encouraged to report adverse events after vaccination to VAERS even if it is not clear that the vaccine caused the adverse event.

Doesn't that make you the 'dumb dumb' then?

Regarding medical examiners submitting to VAERS by Law, you are very naive. If the big boys don't want them to go recorded, they simply make sure it doesn't happen. Law is for us not them and if they want to avoid deaths being recorded, they make a process where it doesn't happen. I'm sorry, you don't know how the world works. Do you know how many things the powers-that-shouldn't-be have ignored to mention are out there killing people? It's ridiculous.

Being a nurse doesn't mean much if you are a system follower. Hundreds of thousands of nurses in the UK refused the vaccine because of what they researched themselves and what they saw it was doing to patients.

People who take care of themselves survive. Vaccinated or not. I would wait. Even so. If you do wanna take the shot I respect it but just wait and see what happens to others first. You may save yourself a lot of bigger trouble in the future for a flu like virus that you could survive anyways. And you may damage your body in the process because all pharmaceutical endeavors have side effects. 

COVID definitely has had a bigger effect on obese people and those who don‚Äôt take care of themselves in general. 

COVID 19 is a manmade substance designed to interact with the deficiencies of the body and utilize interface with your DNA and rewrite your autoimmune responses. It is actually very similar to the bio weapon known as Lyme. The vaccine does the exact same thing to those who have not been infected. That is why they need to send RNA through a vaccine that wait a second, you can just get the virus and get over it...why is this all blowing up and why have nineteen different ‚Äòvariants‚Äô of the same virus been introduced so quickly? This is a forced instance of survival of the fittest. The weak ones obviously won‚Äôt make it. It is definitely planned depopulation. The intelligent ones who will question what is being put in them will be silenced so that the ones who blindly follow instructions will do so. The masks are simply a test of obedience.

"Rational to you means believing whatever mainstream media spits out as gospel and whatever the so called 'experts' are finding to be true in the game of 'science says..'. As you never take the time to delve into the negative or ask why there have been so many inconsistencies, contradictions and outright lies told by the controlled media throughout this last year, you remain stuck on the periphery of life, locked into a false notion of what the world really is. I bring your attention to this quote where Tolstoy prognosticated your very personality:

‚ÄúI know that most men‚Äînot only those considered clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical, or philosophic problems‚Äîcan very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty‚Äîconclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives.‚Äù 

I've heard plenty of nurses who have had the bravery to come out and speak on what they have been seeing in hospitals throughout Operation Covid, the pre-planned massacre of millions of innocents, the gutting of the world and the announced implementation of the 'Great Reset' which is not a conspiracy but a plan to remove the appearance of democracy (a joke itself) to make way for a fascist technocracy.

"That's a difficult one because the head of the beast doesn't reveal it's neck to be chopped. The capstone of the pyramid works from the shadows and does not present itself in any media. These people are above laws, above money and above borders which are all put in place to control us liliputians. What we have is a hierarchy of evil that only becomes apparent as the inner circle meets the outer circle. We can see many high players in such organizations as the Council of Foreign Relations, Royal Institution of International Affairs (Chatham House), Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Club, some Bohemian Grove attendees, The World Economic Forum and many other de facto supra-governmental groups groups. Families like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers are obviously high ups and have great influence over the wealth in the world.

The people we are told have power...presidents, prime ministers etc are just transient puppets who read scripts and take the rotten tomatoes. They do their job, take the heat during their terms and usually then live out their lives in luxury with accolades from their masters for doing their part in the 'Great Work'.

The 1% of the 1% are not like me and you (I would hope you are not a psychopath). They believe themselves to be in a class of their own...social Darwinism's 'fittest'. What most people see as strength they view as weakness. Empathy is repugnant to them and they have been able to rise to their heights by teaching the hoi polloi to turn the other cheek while they have no scruples about using any means possible to attain their position. They could pike a baby like the average might would swat away a fly (I don't kill flies). They could genocide a whole nation before breakfast and not think anything of it while they eat their imported quail egg omelette.

I know how this reads to you, but it doesn't stop it from being true. The film 'Spectre' has a scene that shows a group of psychopaths debating their control over pharmaceuticals. I had to laugh at the obvious programming where the criminal follows his bragging by saying ""but we face challenges from the WHO"" because the WHO are part of the establishment headed by their man Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who was responsible for starving thousands in Ethiopia and I imagine other crimes against humanity. Anyway, that scene although appearing fanciful to viewers is how things operate. Psychopaths working together to manipulate, hoodwink and syphon the very life force of their chattel, us by any means necessary. They often get bored and have their fun with their human ant farm. Sometimes they have to cull their herd.

Operation Covid as I call it is just their latest stepping stone in their long term agenda. A big part of it is reducing the population, an idea that 'they' have been programming the masses to accept as normal since the days of Thomas Malthus.

"This guy belongs on r/insanepeoplefacebook because this is certifiably insane. The vaccine is absolutely the way to finish off this virus, just like any other virus it can mutate but it has a base of the original strain and by logic, means the vaccine still works at the very least helping your body realize which viruses to look out for. And if a human can be made by two people in less than a year, then obviously multiple highly trained and very smart humans can create a vaccine in a year. The only reason death rates are rising is because everyone ISNT taking the vaccine because there isn‚Äôt enough being made/distributed and that travel restrictions are opening up.

If you don‚Äôt understand how to read data and sources, just say so. But you should really withhold your opinions until you understand the data and the arguments they support.

‚Äúgo tell me why all flu cases have disappeared tell me why the influenza cases disappeared‚Äù

Flu and influenza are the same thing. The flu hasn‚Äôt disappeared, but has been greatly reduced because of all the contagious disease control methods adopted by the majority of society... lockdown/isolation, social distancing, hand washing, face covering etc.

‚Äúand many more nobody is dying from this BS of a common cold people are dying from other causes but they are being labeled covid‚Äù

All the data, raised by many independent institutions from both the US and around the world, report a marked increase in deaths in 2020 across the world. If this is being mislabeled as Covid, then what are they dying from? Something has caused deaths to spike in 2020... what was it?

‚Äúi know some IRL and family of mine have tested negative for the virus but it came back positive‚Äù

This makes no sense. They tested negative but it came back positive? So did the test them come back positive? If so, they tested positive. There is much greater scope for a false negative than a false positive. There are many ways to get a false negative (which means they are positive but it came back negative) the tester could get an insignificant section or not enough to test on, etc. A false positive, however, means that the test was fouled with actual virus not from the test subject, I.e cross contamination.

So why does this treatment not get the ""my body my choice"" treatment?

Vaccines don't just affect you. Having a vaccine affects others. There are people who are unable to have a vaccine as their immune system is weak. They need to be protected. The options are 
- they spend their lives in hermetically seal boxes
- they have short lives
- almost everyone else has a vaccine and so the disease essentially can't propagate. 


>Question, if the CDCrecommended 100 vaccines a year, would you take them? How about 200

I don't listen to what the CDC says. I listen to what every single universal healthcare and health insurance company says, because:
- offering a treatment costs them money.
- have no vested interest in treatments, beyond them improving my health
- universal healthcare systems have a long track record of usually being right
- being exceptionally good at determining the impact of quality of life.

I don't take vaccines because I am told to. I take vaccines, because I trust that the third party independent companies (and various research labs) will publish real data.

These groups have nothing to gain from a dangerous or ineffective treatment, appearing safe and effective and so have no motivation to make vaccines artificially look safe.

I believe that if they were even close in negative effects to the diseases which they treat (which have all but disappeared since vaccines were developed for them) then it would be impossible to cover up.

Anti-vax often talk about 30 or even a thousand cases of vaccine injury, with the Covid vaccine, forgetting about the nearly 3 million dead. I would take those odds any day of the week.",mi0c5z,2021-04-03 08:23:13

>I said independent groups, who don't profit from vaccines.

Who are these ""independent groups""? Who funds them? What's in it for them by doing a study. We know theres trillions of pro pharma money for studies, and we know theres 0 anti pharma money for studies, so where is this ""independent"" group coming from?

>Can you explain how a universal healthcare system, profits from making people sick?

Sure. Universal healthcare subsidizes healthcare which lowers the cost to the user, which increases demand (look at college tuition as an example). Increase demand not only raises prices but raises volume as well. But you sidetracked, Big pharma profits off making people sick is the statement, not universal healthcare.

Ok. So we can agree that is wrong. What about if my brakes failed and I killed them. Is that still morally wrong? I didn't intend to kill them, but they were still killed by me driving my truck.

>Who are these ""independent groups""? Who funds them? What's in it for them by doing a study. We know theres trillions of pro pharma money for studies, and we know theres 0 anti pharma money for studies, so where is this ""independent"" group coming from?

The independent groups are often research laboratories, funded by government grants, or a nationalised healthcare provider (who providing treatments costs money to). These are doctors ( in first world countries it is illegal for them to offer a treatment which isn't solely in the best interest of the patient or to take money to prescribe anything).

In fact some studies have been funded by anti-vaxers... Here's one: 

https://www.newsweek.com/anti-vaxxers-accidentally-fund-study-showing-theres-no-link-between-autism-and-379245

>Sure. Universal healthcare subsidizes healthcare which lowers the cost to the user, which increases demand (look at college tuition as an example). Increase demand not only raises prices but raises volume as well. But you sidetracked, Big pharma profits off making people sick is the statement, not universal healthcare. Nice redirect tho

It's not a redirect. You have misunderstood how universal healthcare works. They pay for all healthcare for all citizens for their entire lifetime. They are funded by the government (usually through taxation). They can't make a profit as they are a government service and they don't charge for treatments. (Some universal healthcare have token payments, but usually for unnecessary treatments like boob jobs).

 It highlights that groups who don't and can't profit from treatments still pay their money to get people vaccinated. It completely refutes the idea that vaccines are only prescribed for profit.

Private healthcare is very cheap in universal healthcare countries as they are competing with FREE. They actually massively reduce the cost of healthcare (factor 3-5) by making that a cost to the government.

Increasing demand as a universal healthcare provider, simply increases their costs (as they are now paying for more treatments). Harming patients, increases their costs as they then have to pay to treat the harm. The only way they can reduce costs is by preventative care. Paying for preemptive treatments which reduce future illness.",mi0c5z,2021-04-04 08:43:52

"I recommend talking about your thought process and listening to her thought process rather then trying to hammer with facts or present an air tight case.  I have a brother who I disagree with a lot and I have found when I try and convince him that he is wrong with arguments he digs in and the goalposts always moves.  The other thing is he is not trained but he isn't stupid typically there is a germ of a reasonable idea or truth at the root.  For example with the covid vaccine, approval was expediated, it was expediated based on risk vs reward and I believe that was the correct call but people who pretend that the risk is zero or that someone is crazy (perhaps unreasonable but not crazy) for being concerned.  For me, that kind of response would be like if someone said they were afraid to fly and someone told them they were crazy, I think flying is very safe and the risk is extremely low but the risk is not zero and I don't help my case if I try to tell them they are stupid for being afraid.  So I would talk to them in a way that looks something like this:

1.) Hear out there view 

2.) Lay out your view focusing on your though process or logic instead of fact

3.) Try to find the common ground, acknowledge the points they have and address them.  For example, you might acknowledge that there is a low probability that long term side effects are a risk but you feel the reward outweighs the benefit.  Hopefully this focuses the discussion on the actual disagreement and you are not both talking past each other. 

4.) Agree to disagree.  After the first 3 steps you may find there are things you just disagree on, if someone understands your point and disagrees with it you have to just accept that hammering the same point over and over will not endear your point to anyone.",mgv5ic,2021-03-31 13:49:52

"About the Covid vax specifically, there are these facts:  


* The studies for the five vaccines approved in the West are very large for clinical studies. There are drugs on the market where the control group in a study was less than 2,000 people; the control groups here (the folks who got the real shot) add up to 75,000 people.
* Those 75,000 had drastically reduced rates of Covid, and those who got it were more likely to be asymptomatic. Only a few were hospitalized for Covid and their death rate was ZERO. 
* In a random group of 75,000 Americans, hundreds would be hospitalized and about 150 would die.

"There's two sides to understand. Firstly, how the antivax movement started, and secondly, what vaccines actually are today and what they do. 

With the first, being a little prepared with understanding Andrew Wakefield who started the modern anitvax stuff, is really good. Wikipedia does a great job surmising it - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\_Wakefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) Taking note especially that his main concern was to prove a link between autism, because he was getting paid hundreds of thousands to prove it so millionaire parents of autistic children could make lawsuits, based on their theories that ""must be the vaccine that hurt my genetically perfect child"". This despite autism being a genetic issue and vaccines to not alter DNA. (one of the reasons Autism is knee-jerk blamed on vaccines is the behavioral issues linked with autism often start manifesting coincidentally the same ages children are receiving shots). 

With the second, the sidebar has some links, and there's good articles online explaining how vaccines work, why they work, why we have track records of them working, but honestly, unless you take serveral years of medical school and then several more years in specializing in immunology, you aren't going to understand it fully, and neither will your mom. 

One thing though, we have data we have lots and lots of data - but we don't have studies. Why? Because you can't have a control group of children whom you give a deadly virus to and watch them suffer or die from it - so you can't ethically do a conclusive study (which is what antivaxxers mean when they say ""vaccines havn't been proven""). All you can do is collect data from people who have been vaccinated, those who haven't, and draw conclusions. 

And we have tons of that type of data. And the data says that statistically while a couple in several million might get complications from a vaccine, the likely hood of severe or deadly complications arising from preventable diseases is far, far higher. 

Also, a favorite quoted thing is the amount of medical payouts on complications 'caused by vaccines'. This is because while there's no direct proof, the medical field will almost always payout on a claim. That's right, no evidence but almost guaranteed payout.  Hence the perception that vaccines are dangerous because they keep paying out on 'complications'. 

I too was skeptical about vaccines, and maybe was even leaning to 'soft-antivaxxer', until I married a nurse who was able to explain in 'normal person' why so much of the claims are garbage and why there's so much misunderstanding concerning vaccines.",mgv5ic,2021-03-31 03:46:24

"I'm antivaxer turned pro vax, and I would like to warn you that the user you are responding to got some important stuff about the antivax movement wrong, so using their arguments with your MIL may not work well

>Andrew Wakefield who started the modern anitvax stuff

This is false, the vaccine autism fear started with the DTP vaccine over a decade before his fake MMR autism study

>autism being a genetic issue and vaccines to not alter DNA

Genetics are not the only factor in autism, the fact that vaccines do not alter DNA is not proof that they do not cause autism

This is not what antivaxers usually mean, what they mean is that there has never been a randomized study comparing kids with no vaccines to kids with all recommended vaccines over a period of years, the reason antivaxers want such a study is to check for longterm vaccine side effects, they aren't saying to purposely expose anyone to viruses

>a couple in several million might get complications from a vaccine

Serious complication rates are low, but not this low [https://www.who.int/initiatives/the-global-vaccine-safety-initiative/tools-and-methods/reaction-rates-information-sheets](https://www.who.int/initiatives/the-global-vaccine-safety-initiative/tools-and-methods/reaction-rates-information-sheets)

I‚Äôm not antivaxxer but the odds that a company accidentally caused the mutation of the virus while testing vaccines seems entirely plausible it‚Äôs a necessary evil and was kept quite contained and limited but still it dosent seem incorrect from the outset,mezlin,2021-03-28 19:23:50
"according to this [https://dryburgh.com/geert-vanden-bossche-open-letter-to-who-halt-all-covid-19-mass-vaccination/](https://dryburgh.com/geert-vanden-bossche-open-letter-to-who-halt-all-covid-19-mass-vaccination/)  there could be something to this with the correlation above. Because of the high prevalence of cases the virus will have much more opportunity to be challenged into developing into a more severe mutation (think antibiotics and why they're are careful about prescribing the most suitable ones these days, and clearly instruct us to take the full course of the prescription to make sure the infection has fully cleared), especially if the virus is challenged when someone is between the first and second dose where the full immunity isn't realized yet. More severe mutations that happen to arise from the challenge have a chance to be shed and spread if the immunity gained isn't strong at this point. After all we are all told that after we get the vaccine we can still catch the virus and still spread it, i.e. the endpoint of the vaccine studies were based off of lessening the severity of illness. However it's theoretical and we'll have to wait and see (i.e. we'd see initial decrease in cases and deaths from the vaccine, but then a strong increase in cases and deaths from mutations arising that might be resistant to the vaccine, and although bad for both, potentially putting the vaccinated in a worse position that the unvaccinated). Variants arising that are both more transmissible and more deadly (like the Kent UK variant), definitely aren't the norm and are a troubling indication.

Certain types of DNA viruses such as HPV viruses can cause cancer through integration. Interestingly enough these viruses also do not contain any integration machinery. Although HPV oncogenesis is also influenced by the specific proteins it integrates. Anyways there has yet to be any evidence of adenoviral vectors integrating in humans, let alone causing cancer.

"Yet, this ""1%""  makes all the difference in highly vaccinated population, like Israel...",mb7921,2021-03-23 07:16:10
"The issue here is the conflation of relative and absolute risk. 

You generally want to look at the relative risk reduction for medicines, since that gives you a clearer picture of what's happening. Sometimes the absolute risk is small enough that the effect size looks small (as with the vaccine), when it is actually quite large -- the placebo group in these studies were told to still maintain the social distancing and other safety practices, and they still had far more cases. 

With the lipitor example, you only expect to see a small percentage of people have cardiac events in a particular time frame -- as long as the absolute reduction in risk is statistically significant, there's still a benefit. A 36% relative risk reduction isn't the best medicine in the world, but it's pretty good!

Ninja edit to add: think of it this way; if the vaccine was 100% effective at stopping covid (it's nearly there, but not quite!), this person's math would still say there was only about 1% difference in infection. Relative risk gives you the effect size!",mb7921,2021-03-23 13:16:22

You decrease your odds of getting Covid by 95 % IF EXPOSED.  For a placebo group everyone who was exposed would likely have contracted the disease.  If you had two placebo groups both would be expected to have approximately the same number of infections per capita.  So the difference in people infected per capita is attributed to the vaccine.  If you are not exposed you have a zero percent chance of getting it so those numbers tell us nothing.  If I was testing a bullet proof vest for use among police and one group wore it and the other didn't the numerator would be people who were shot and killed/seriously injured and the denominator would be everyone in the group but the majority of people who are on each group don't get shot and therefore tell me nothing about the effectiveness of the vest.,mb7921,2021-03-23 14:40:25
"The issue with any human clinical trials is that you have to test the efficacy of a drug without intentionally exposing the test subject to a pathogen or intentionally inducing a condition. For Lipitor, you can't just place everyone into the conditions that would induce a heart attack and compare the placebo group to the experimental group. Same thing with COVID. You can't just give everyone COVID and compare the vaccinated against the unvaccinated. That's like war crime level negligence. You have to extrapolate based on known population trends of infection and survival and compare that to the effects of people in the study. So out the entire study group, if 95% less people die from covid than in a similar sized random grouping of the general population, aka the placebo group, you can say the vaccine is 95% ""effective"".

Not to defend Pfizer, but the problem that pharmaceutical companies have is trying to convey complicated statistical models to the common public. The claim they were making with lipitor is that if you are a high risk for a heart attack the drug will lower your chances of having a heart attack better than if you are a low risk, and this is kind of common sense. You can give the drug to a bunch of high school athletes and obviously you're analysis will show that it had zero effectiveness because there was no variation between the experimental and the placebo group in that neither had heart attacks in the study time. However, if you give the drug to a bunch of obese septuagenarians with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions and who smoke, then you may see that there was a significant difference between the experiment group and the placebo group. Basically, the more at risk you are for a heart attack, the more ""effective"" the drug is, but the vast majority of the population is not at a high risk of heart attack, so they have to qualify it. The drug may only be 1% or 2% effective across ALL people, but its 36% effective for the people that actually need the drug.",mb7921,2021-03-23 16:25:50
"I don‚Äôt know if the claim in the add is true or not. But the statistical analysis about 1% is wrong. 

The claim of 36% is not far off and may even be true depending on how they rounded the numbers. 

The difference between 3% and 2% is not 1%. It is one percent point. In fact it is 33.3333%. 
If 10000 people were in each group, 300 in the placebo group had a heart attack. And 200 in the non-placebo. The difference is 1/3. Or 33.33333%. 
In the add the may have rounded the numbers for simplicity‚Äôs sake, so that in fact it was a few more in the placebo group  as a few less in the other group who had heart attacks, making it 36%. 

So basically, it lowers the chance of a heart attack as stated. 

What medical companies then forget to tell is the individual risk and the change in relative and absolute risk for the individual. So the overall risk for the individual is really small and the reduction, although impressive on its own, means a relatively small change in the individual risk. But for the group as a whole, it is still significant. 

And if there is a lowering of the risk, then it would be worth it, just to save a few lives.

"Hi!

Firstly, I'm so glad you got your daughter vaccinated, as it will keep her safe in the long run.

Secondly, I'm not a parent but I'm sure it was difficult to watch your daughter cry (I do have 2 younger siblings that I love though, and I know I hate seeing them hurt), so I wanted to tell you how brave you are despite that.

Thirdly, this woman is an absolute nutcase. Natural things are nice, and many traditional medicines have medical merit! However, it's important to note that the vast majority of today's medical treatments are derived from ""natural remedies"", and modifications are generally to increase their efficacy as treatments. 

That being said, all kids enjoy having nice-smelling liquid waved in front of their face, they'd react similarly if you filled a spray bottle with gatorade and waved that in front of their face.",m2ntbd,2021-03-11 20:32:44

"Parent of 3 and 5 year old girls here. 
Personally, I'd try my damnest to raise a girl so strong minded she could give two fucks what anybody says about her lisp. She knows she's smart, whole, loving, caring, beautiful, etc. And usually, thise who bully aren't happy, they're self conscious, or crying for help (abused and the like) so we should try to respond nicely and be freidnly, but if we're pushed too far, we can prove to them also that words hurt (only when walking away from the situation fails). I pray that my kids will stand up for themselves. A friend of mine at work recently told me how his daughter got hit in the face on a school bus. When I asked if she left the seat or hit back, he said ""No, she was too scared to hit back, and didn't leave. So she got hit again"". 
I've used this example with my girls and said thats unacceptable. You move seats, or hit them back if you have to. If things go too far, find an adult. But bottom line, love yourself enough to fend for yourself, cause your worth it. 

I'm confused on the vaccine part. I cant tell if you vax your kid or not. But personally, that's not important to me at all. We all raise our families different. 

My point is, a lisp is not to bat an eye at. Sure, at a young age, its tough to deal with if your the one dealing with it. People might laugh or poke fun. But those people also have flaws. If Suzy makes fun of your lisp, remind Suzy about how she passed her pants at Maggie's birthday party last weekend. Or simply tell Suzy that hurt my feelings and you shouldn't make fun of people - if this is met with a snarky reply, I give full authority to my girls to do what they feel they need to in order to defend themselves. I've even gotten a call from school that my 3 year old hit a child in daycare and needs to be talked to. When I asked why, they said ""a kid bit her and took her toy then she hit him."" I said ""I taught her to do that.""

I hope things work out for your family the way you intend for then to, regardless of others opinions. Kids are so mean now a days, but we csn still raise angels amongst the heathens haha. I hope so at least",m2ntbd,2021-03-16 00:51:35

Most notable in this discussion is the CDC-funded Harvard study conducted about VAER's effectiveness and reliability.  The final report stated, ""Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. ...Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported.""  In other words, for every 100 adverse reactions that occur, only 1 of them is actually reported to VAERS.  This is a broken and failing reporting system. It is routinely said that adverse reactions are rare when in fact, based on this study, it is the opposite. 

This is just a snippet of what's going on at VAERS:

"And, again, 'they' claim that VAERS is underreported based on...?

Actual studies show that it's massively *over*reported.  Entries have no requirement for verification whatsoever, in fact it's the opposite; I know of a guy who reported that a vaccine had turned him into the Incredible Hulk and the *only* reason it's not still listed there as a side effect is because he gave them permission to take it down.",m2s4e6,2021-03-11 23:59:53
"I don't know, take it up with Harvard and the CDC. Or are they made up of 'Karens'?

It's massively underreported because not many people even know VAERS exists. Lots of people who die don't get in there because it's their relatives that have the onus to report it and they are too busy grieving to think about that. What do you mean 'actual studies'? Are the CDC and Harvard not doing actual studies?

I've read through many Covid vaccine stories...I can assure you that they are genuine and very sad. 

Listen, I don't want to swap articles with you. You are defending evil vaccine companies like Pfizer who have paid millions to families and governments for horrible crimes against humanity which makes you what Lenin called a 'useful idiot'. 

Here's the link to the latest Astra Zeneca report from the UK. 201,622 adverse reactions including what looks like cancers and 275 deaths in a couple of months:

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/968414/COVID-19_AstraZeneca_Vaccine_Analysis_Print.pdf

This is untested genetic modification technology that very stupidly you are defending without knowing anything about it. They say they don't even know. Well, I think I know that if this was any other product on the market causing these reactions and deaths, it would have been taken off the market immediately. But as you and most of humanity work with doublethink, cognitive dissonance and the Semmelweis Effect, those numbers are acceptable and evil wins the day.

This goes way deeper than you think but keep defending your friends in high places...they have a love hate relationship with people like you. Love you because you indirectly work for their cause against other humans and hate you because you can't think critically and are not in their class.",m2s4e6,2021-03-12 00:18:08
"Sure, buddy.  The trials had a zero percent rate of side effects lasting more than two days but all of a sudden hundreds of thousands of people are dying... I'll take a bet that no more than one in a thousand of those are legitimate side effects, and those are because some dumbshit took the vaccine without checking his allergy list.  The rest are split between hypochondriacs, scam artists, trolls taking the piss, and people like yourself who blame every little problem on needles because you never got over your childhood fear of jabs.

Edit: And the very fact that you call it 'genetic modification' and 'untested' betrays the fact that I know more about it than you do.",m2s4e6,2021-03-12 00:26:25

Yep, you know more than me:

Tested for how long on humans? 20minutes, 1 day, 5 days, 4 weeks, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 30 years? That's right, as far as I'm concerned, untested. Only the low consciousness would trust a vaccine that isn't tested for years and doesn't believe that problems can come later.

3. There are people who just can‚Äôt take the vaccines (organ transplants, cancer, immunocompromised) and are taking a boat but person swimming in the water gets too close and topples the boat.

 2 the people who made the vaccine openly admit it didn't go through the same clinical trials that a normal vaccine would go through. Therefore it's not tested.

"""you don't have any evidence to support your claims"" I'm not making claims you are you're claiming that the human race simply cannot survive without 47 injections at birth. 

""We're talking about science not court"" was it scientist that issued the lockdown or was it state governments that enforced the lockdown? for the last 3 months as science been saying that the lockdowns are more detrimental to society than the virus? Or is it the government who says the lockdowns need to stay in place? I'm not confused about the difference between science and authority. You seem to be.

""They're being rightfully criticized"" rightfully criticizes different from effectively debated or outright censored entirely. Yes. Yes that's censoring. if they were going to do it like that they should have did it years ago with jackass was jumping off a roofs and shit because it might convince other people to fucking do it. they're not censoring people because they think you'll listen to them mistakenly. They're censoring people because afraid somebody might give them information they don't want them to have. So they cant make an independent choice that doesn't benefit the powers to be.

""FDA sets our standards"" watch a documentary about the FDA and how they come across their approval standards. The FDA is just as corrupt as Congress. They will approve a pill based on financial investment without ever performing a study on it. That's a fact Jack. The FDA is far more concerned with giving a free pass to the wealthy pharmaceutical industries producing their medication than they are with actually testing that medication.

"2.5 million people have died who had a coronavirus in their bodies.

If ADE is an issue as it appears then there will be MANY more deaths soon from the vaccines.

It will take a few months before we see most of the deaths.

The United States had 10% excess deaths last year.

MOST countries did not have any excess deaths last year.

There have been nearly twice as many deaths per day in many countries ever since the vaccines started.


I fail go see your point...

If the vaccine is dangerous and killing people why does it even matter how many covid-19 deaths there have been?

No the f*** they're not tested you dumb s*** because the way they test them is not the correct way to do it.you don't inject millions of people with a vaccine and then run through the metadata over the next few years seeing if the disease you were aiming to eliminate is slightly down more. That's how they're currently testing these vaccines by just spamming them on the public and reading the metadata after the fact. Never once and you can never find me a test where they did this do they put 20 people in one room and 20 people in a different room. They give 20 people a vaccine and 20 people placebo. Then they expose all 40 people to the same pathogen. Obviously the 20 people who got the vaccine should react way better than the 20 people who got the placebo.

>""FDA sets our standards"" watch a documentary about the FDA and how they come across their approval standards. The FDA is just as corrupt as Congress. They will approve a pill based on financial investment without ever performing a study on it. That's a fact Jack. The FDA is far more concerned with giving a free pass to the wealthy pharmaceutical industries producing their medication than they are with actually testing that medication.

WHAT DOCUMENTARY?  If it was credible wouldn't you want to share it with me to back your arguments?  Seems like it might not be credible and not backed by science.

Even Wakefields study was never ""debunked"" through scientific replication. Just a media smear campaign that can be debunked with a highschool education.

>So i asked you do this twice and the best you could come up with is people being arrested for not following covid restrictions and lockdowns?

So you asked me twice for the very tiny minute infinitesimal example of an anti vaxxer being arrested for anti vaxxing. But you won't accept the literally thousands upon thousands of people who've been targeted for every aspect of resistance. Anti mask rallies, whole countries fighting lockdowns, states lifting restrictions and being called selfish and murders... No no. You specifically asked for a single person posting an anti vax meme and getting arrested so all that don't count. That's strawmanning 101. Very soon people who refuse the vaxxing will be targeted just the same.

Well the control the regulating institutions, give federal grants to the creators of the drugs, they control the regulation of the competition, and regularly use that control to shut down the competition in favor of the people who got the grant, thus stifling competition and ensuring a return on the investment. You act like none of these things are connected. They're connected 7 ways from Kevin Bacon back and forth and back again. The execs at the FDA used to lobby for big pharma.

Please do tell how is Vaxxed backed by science?  Do you have a documentary for me or are you going to try and tell me what my degrees are?   Where is the evidence for your claims? I would like to see it.  Wakefield's study was debunked by multiple professionals he was disbarred from practicing medicine.  Do you live in a different reality?  Where are you finding the evidence for the validity of The lancet report?  Is that evidence peer reviewed?  Do you have evidence that vaccines cause autism?  Also one more thing can you put me in contact with the people who will pay me to debunk bad faith argument and explain science to people?  You conspiracy theorists should have a cooperation narrowed down by this point of where they all receive their training and who pays them.  There should be a massive paper trail connecting payments to random citizens throughout the US if im a paid troll.

>Just like you strawman mine. Tick for tack. Don't like it get off the web. And the fact that you straw manned the fuck out of my first comment shows that strawmanning is only something your concerned with when it's used against you.

I agree that more research should be done over infantile vaccine reaction, to be able to develop more efficient & less dangerous vaccines, and to know better when to give (or not) a shot. In the meantime though, the risk associated with vaccines is so less than this associated with the diseases, that not vaccinating is quite dumb. Also, the CoViD vaccine is currently not given to children, who are the most subject to high reactions.

""Patient vaccinated on 12/28. Approximately one day later, develops cough and on azithromycin x 1 week. On 1/3, patient develops left-sided weakness and aphasia. Taken to the hospital, tested COVID+, required intubation -- acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID - on H&P. Patient died on 1/4/21 at 7:20am.""


How do you explain the massive amount of deaths in  healthy young people from blood clotting issues after being vaccinated?

Such asHaley Link Brinkmeyer, Kasidi Kurill, Tim Zook, Brittany Hall Perez and Sara Stickles to name a few.

"Because there were allegations of encephalitis (the legitimacy of which is still disputed) caused by DTP vaccine in the 1980s, and some cases of encephalitis lead to lasting brain damage with symptoms similar to severe autism, so some people got the idea that autism is brain damage from vaccine-induced encephalitis

Due to safety concerns, DTP was replaced in the US by DTaP, a similar but safer and more refined vaccine, side effects of this are similar to but rarer than those of DTP

Unfortunately no studies have looked at whether DTP or DTaP cause autism

Then in 1998 a British doctor made fraudulent and now debunked claims about MMR causing autism, and in the early 2000s regulators discovered that the mercury levels in vaccines were well above the safe limit for children, prompting additional concern about autism, given that mercury affects the brain, and leading to the remove of mercury based preservative from most US vaccines, however subsequent studies determined that the preservative in vaccines (thimerosal) is eliminated form the body more easily than some other mercury compounds

Autism also tends to occur at the same age as vaccination and has no clearly understood cause, so it is something people tend to speculate about the cause of",ly1sn8,2021-03-05 03:01:27
"This allegation is not coming from anywhere, but an actual fraudulent 'study' from *Andrew Wakefield*, who has a lot of blood on his hands, and is enjoying a lot of complacency from society. I actually don't know if that idea is prior to him, but he is one of the criminals who is still helping to spread that vaccine cause autism.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\_Wakefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield#The_Lancet_fraud)",ly1sn8,2021-03-05 18:30:17
"Because autism spectrum disorder is continually being studied, and expanded to describe previously differently specified disorders, so the rate of autism is on the rise as it is expanded.   
So they latched on to that. But also because autism is associated with behavioral disorders, it strikes at the biggest fear of narcissistic, entitled, short-sighted suburbanites; that their child may not be perfect. They would rather them be dead than have any type of affliction.",ly1sn8,2021-03-15 08:46:48
"Because autism is a relatively new disease in terms of  being recognized and diagnosed. Kids in the 1940s had autism, but pediatric psychiatry wasn't really a field back then so it was rare to be diagnosed with it. It wasn't until the last few decades when a lot of cases were actually being diagnosed, so it could look (to a stupid person) like there has been a massive upswing in incidence of autism instead of just better detection and acknowledgment.",ly1sn8,2021-03-05 07:26:56
"Also - the reason the Dr made the claims is he was being paid hundreds of thousands by Rich people to prove a link between Vaccines causing Autism, so they could proceed with lawsuits (he didn't disclose the fact he was being funded for a particular outcome when he presented his information to the Lancet - a prestigious medical Journal who published his falsified 'findings' immediately as they were concerned. They later retracted the article when they found out he'd falsified his data, failed to disclose private funding, and also conducted experiments on children without permission).

All of this because apparently, often the signs of autism start manifesting around the same age many children start receiving vaccines, causing ""correlation"" issues where people assume since it happened around the same time ( it didn't - it's something you're born with), it must be the cause.

"As countries worldwide scramble to vaccinate their citizens against the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, governments have to make the uncomfortable calculus of **who deserves to get the vaccine right now**. The ones who are spreading it the most? The ones in essential high-risk jobs? People over a certain age? That threshold is unclear and hotly contested. With [several months to go](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html) before vaccines are readily available to any desiring American adult, legislators have to ask The Question: who first? And, as more vaccine becomes available, they will also have to ask whether **it is morally justified for the U.S. government to mandate every citizen or every healthcare worker to take the vaccine?** If many states mandate every child to be vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella, is COVID-19 significantly different?

In August 2020, **Justin Bernstein**, a philosopher at Florida Atlantic University, co-authored [**a paper**](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/publications/interim-framework-for-covid-19-vaccine-allocation-and-distribution-in-the-us) answering precisely this question. And while the state of the world has changed significantly since then, the core question of how governments value their citizens, when, and why remains constant (if you‚Äôre curious, the U.S. government places the monetary value of a human life at [roughly $10 million](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/843310123/how-government-agencies-determine-the-dollar-value-of-human-life)).

Podcast Editor Josh Wagner sat down with Justin to ask precisely these burning questions. For Justin, vaccines are just like any other vital resource that the government needs to allocate. And, in his mind, while our government has been failing in its mandate to protect public health, it is still the best means we have.¬†",ly27ru,2021-03-05 02:50:20

Vaccination doesn‚Äôt help those people too much. Their immune system is shot, they are totally vulnerable.

I also believe that reopening will work better if a large portion of people are vaccinated, Ive looked at a lot of data and studies on covid and from what I have seen around 1.5 million total deaths and many more cases of longterm illness in the US are inevitable without a vaccine or some major treatment breakthrough

lockdowns and masks will only slow the virus, not eradicate it, and whenever lockdowns and masks end the virus will infect more people until nearly everyone has gotten it, and with a case fatality rate of 0.5%, it will kill a total of 1.5 million people",lx9zue,2021-03-04 02:57:10

"yes  , exactly 
the numbers are exaggerated , but only in their favour 

the point is that every single one of person who dies of something while having covid is considered a covid death ,but when it comes to the vaccine , even when there are thousands of death and the chances are so high than the usual , they dissaprove every single one of the death 
out of this 5% deaths which i talked about earlier , if you search it up it says none of those thousands if deaths are related to the vaccine ( im not saying everyone of them died of covid but i do believe that there would me many and its all not just a coincidence when the odds are so high)

i was watching the news yesterday and it says that a man died of falling from a ladder actually died of covid and not from the ladder because the severity of infection made him fall ... like what?
https://nypost.com/2020/11/18/croatian-man-who-died-after-falling-from-ladder-was-killed-by-covid-19/

and even when there are deaths within 15 to 20 minutes if vaccination , they deny any relation .
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.scroll.in/latest/988424/coronavirus-45-year-old-man-dies-minutes-after-receiving-second-dose-of-vaccine-in-thane

it just seems like they are trying to sell you the fear of virus and buy their vaccine

and this manupulation of deaths deaths is just one thing , they are manipulating deaths in like so many ways 

1.the flu all over the world is like dead , 6.5 million of people died of flu back in 2018 according to the WHO
and in the year 2020 the flu is just like completely gone , its down by 90, 95, 99 % in most regions , not just us , but israel , england , everywhere . So where do you think those 6.5 million deaths gonna go in 2020 ( flu and covid has same symptoms and they dignose you covid on the basis of symptoms) 

2. they are like saying that everyone who died with covid , dies of covid 

in uk they dont even bother , they just put everyone who dies while they had covid for last 28 days died with covid . so i was to have covid tested positive and die 27 days later with a car acccident , recovered or no , i would have died of covid....
https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/

so my question is that if this virus is so deadly , so harmful , a complete threat to humanity as they say it is .. why do they need to exagerrate these deaths  

and why are they selling an experimental vaccine saying that its so safe and at the same point ignoring all those thosands of death

the virus has a mortality rate of 0.05% which is so small , and even this small number is exaggerated the shit out of . 

so i dont think anyone needs a vaccine ( which is completeky safe ) for a virus this deadly 

anyways im glad to hear that your friends and family are in perfect health after getting vaccinated and pray that no harm may come to them in future , you are a cool dude (unlike those people who just disregard everything someone says if its against vaccines and their only argument is karen word).",lx9zue,2021-03-11 11:40:23

im not antivax btw just against the covid vaccine and i do believe in the virus its just that im not scared of something with a mortality rate of less than 0.05%.

"Many questions asked in your post; I‚Äôll try my best to unfold my views based on my observations on this since the measles outbreaks worldwide back in 2019. 

1. There are over 250+ non-profits and pro-vaccine advocates just in the U.S. itself who work 1:1 and on social media with many vaccine-hesitant families. There is a huge difference between being vaccine-hesitant, vaccine skeptic, anti-vax due to personal beliefs, and anti-vax spewing conspiracy theories and unscientific remedies (including asking people to drink bleach, putting potato in a sock and not taking the child to a doc when the child‚Äôs fever due to flu is spiking beyond dangerous levels, to name a few concrete examples.) Social media censorship is spottily happening to the last category, at least in the U.S. So, saying that ubiquitously people‚Äôs voices are stopped is not factual and does disservice to the tireless good work community advocates are doing listening to hesitant and skeptic communities. 

2. On the anecdote of some of your vaccinated friends being sick more than you - there is again a big difference in someone being sick and someone having deadly complications. Having a slightly raised temperature as vaccine antibodies are working (which resolves within a couple days) is being called sickness as much as having life-threatening complications due to pneumonia developed from flu virus and being in the ICU. There are a number of people who were raised antivax and after facing near-death experiences in their families have understood what sickness due to vaccine-preventable diseases truly means. 

3. ‚ÄúWhy not natural remedies?‚Äù I grew up in a household where sure, we drink ginger tea when we have a cold or cough, but we know the limits of natural remedies. These are not remedies when a fever is spiking beyond 103, or remedies to prevent polio (imagine living with deformed legs) to give examples. Evidence-based science is what it is about. No one is saying don‚Äôt eat citrus and healthy foods but using that to mean one can survive the onslaught of measles or HPV is beyond rationality. Unfortunately some vulnerable parents buy into it. 

4. Finally, the most important question you asked - motive behind antivax. A lot of it is about money. You should read about the huge increase in sales of holistic remedies by Mercola: https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2019/10/15/fdc01078-c29c-11e9-b5e4-54aa56d5b7ce_story.html. This is just the tip of iceberg of how money is being made.",lxarq3,2021-03-17 17:10:52

I'm not taking the vaccine due to the vaccine in Kenyan that were funded by bill gates that caused 150 thousand people to me sterile. And now he is the main celebrating pushing this narrative. Id rather be killed than become sterile and live a life of no children. Some may argue the vaccine won't make you sterile then prove it. But you can't because there's always reasonable doubt that it may do that. So I'm never taking anything from doctors due to that reason. I'm sorry but I just don't trust anything and anyone before .

"I‚Äôm not an expert in vaccines, but I do know a thing or two about talking to antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Don‚Äôt get bogged down in making broad claims about vaccines as a whole, because then all it takes is one loophole to ‚Äúdiscredit‚Äù your entire argument. She isn‚Äôt an antivaxxer, so the last thing you want to do is to send her down the rabbit hole (which is a *very* slippery slope.) You aren‚Äôt talking about all vaccines here, you‚Äôre talking about a literal handful of vaccines in particular, so focus on the specifics of the COVID vaccines. 

There‚Äôs been a fair bit of misinformation going around on Instagram / Facebook, including what appear to be fake screen shots warning of fertility impacts, but as far as I can tell they‚Äôre just that: fake. The EUAs and information for prescribers and recipients for each vaccine are public, and while there is some language about birth defects etc. the context is important because it‚Äôs specifically regarding what legally must be reported to VAERS with *any* vaccine ‚Äî not evidence of side effects ‚Äî and the prevalence of pregnancy-related issues in all people, vaccinated or not. The EUAs also include fun information like the fact that only 0.3% of recipients in the trial had any sort of adverse reaction (swelling, pain, etc.), but also that 0.2% of people who got the *placebo* reported the same side effects. 

The other reason you don‚Äôt want to start citing other vaccines is that the COVID vaccines (in particular the Modern and Pfizer ones) *are* somewhat new technology. It‚Äôs totally normal and OK to be nervous about that, but despite the misinformation, it‚Äôs not as scary as it sounds. No, they don‚Äôt modify your DNA ‚Äî they use modified RNA (different than DNA) as a vector to ‚Äúteach‚Äù your body how to recognize the characteristic protein spike of COVID-19 and manufacture the antibody ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt at all unlike how traditional vaccines that use a dead virus work. There‚Äôs also this idea floating around that it isn‚Äôt even a vaccine because it doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting infected. While it‚Äôs true that there isn‚Äôt proof that they prevent infection, they do prevent the virus from replicating and creating symptoms, and that‚Äôs literally one of the ways that some traditional vaccines operate (search term: therapeutic vaccine). They‚Äôve also shown to be almost 100% effective in eliminating serious cases ‚Äî that ‚Äú95%‚Äù number you see floating around is very misleading because it‚Äôs looking at all cases ‚Äî including totally asymptomatic ones or ones that amount to the sniffles (the vast majority). It *might* not stop the virus from getting into your body, but it *will* make you drastically less likely to get sick from it. 

There‚Äôs no evidence I can find of reproductive effects from any of the COVID vaccines ‚Äî but there *is* evidence of reproductive effects from getting a symptomatic case COVID virus. 

The most important thing in all of this though isn‚Äôt the information ‚Äî it‚Äôs how you communicate with her. ‚ÄúHow to Win Friends and Influence People‚Äù is, IMO, a terribly overrated book that everyone should read because the core tenants are spot on. The best way to win an argument is not to have one. Empathize with her, listen to her, and don‚Äôt preach, criticize or shun. I‚Äôve spent more hours than I can count purposefully spelunking into the QAnon / anti-vaccine rabbit hole (along with most other conspiracy theories) and it‚Äôs definitely one of the most dangerous ones I‚Äôve come across for the amount of brain power it takes to parse out and refute the various claims. I‚Äôm naturally an information junky who‚Äôs skeptical of literally everything and actually enjoys and does this kind of thing professionally, and while I might have more of a natural immunity to it than some, I don‚Äôt fault people for falling down the rabbit hole. The way they twist / misuse information is *masterful.* 

Oof, that was a lot more long-winded and rambly than I intended.  Sorry. 

If you want to show her information, I‚Äôd stick to the primary sources like the EUAs because it‚Äôs harder to just say ‚Äúfake news‚Äù (or whatever), but if you want some background info for yourself there‚Äôs a great podcast called ‚ÄúConspirituality‚Äù that touches on this stuff from a hippie wellness perspective, and on the flip side Ron Bailey over at Reason Magazine has done some great reporting on this stuff. He‚Äôs consistently had some of the most clear-headed and level takes since the beginning of the pandemic. 

Good luck!

(BTW, it‚Äôs ‚Äúaffect‚Äù in this case. The best way to remember it is think ‚Äúa‚Äù for ‚Äúaction.‚Äù An affect is an action, and an effect is a thing ‚Äî there‚Äôs some tricky exceptions, but TBH it‚Äôs not worth worrying about. Just use that rule and 99.5% of the time you‚Äôll be correct, and if you‚Äôre wrong only 0.1% of people or so will notice anyway).",lvflrq,2021-03-01 21:25:47
"Show her the inserts they put inside of the vaccine boxes, they should have them laying around at any vaccine center. Not an informative bulletin board copied piece of paper they might hand out. The actual inserts. It should be a small piece of paper folded up quite a bit. In it will detail risks to reproductive harm, if any, and whatever else.",lvflrq,2021-03-01 22:34:19
"A picture I keep seeing floating around Facebook is about the trials recommending not trying to get pregnant or something like that (it‚Äôs been a while since I read it). People are saying that it‚Äôs due to fertility issues. But during the 1st few rounds of trails they don‚Äôt want pregnant women as they don‚Äôt know any affects. Which the OB people fought for pregnant women to have the choice due to the accidental pregnancies during trails and stuff. They can also start collecting the data to make sure it‚Äôs safe as most medications for pregnant women will get a safety rating.

Not all vaccines are the same, and there have been vaccines that were discovered to have serious side effects only after they had been in use, this happened with both of the  swine flu scares  [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html)

"Worth mentioning in regards to GBS: One can get this from ANY bacteria/virus, not just from remnants of one in a vaccine. So really, assuming this is the only potential side-effect in this case, the choice is receive immunization against a potentially deadly disease with a significantly small risk of developing GBS, OR, don't receive the vaccine and potentially get said deadly disease AND have a chance at developing GBS. 

&#x200B;

""Studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS after  getting the flu than after vaccination. It is important to keep in mind  that severe illness and death are associated with flu, and getting  vaccinated is the best way to prevent flu infection and its  complications.

It's all really just a matter of weighing the pros/cons, but I definitely agree that long-term effects are a bit scary to think about from either the vaccine or Covid itself, since we don't really know what either will look like.

Sorry you're getting downvoted, I assume most people just read the first part and thought and immediately jumped to ""this guy must be anti-vaxx"" rather than actually trying to discuss the matter.

"I totally agree with you.  There are reasons for long term clinical trials.  I think it is a personal risk assessment.  I am 55 and although I know I could be at risk, I would prefer to mask up and socially distance until at least one COVID vaccine receives FDA approval.  

I got the MMR last June as some studies are indicating it results in cross-immunity to COVID.   Countries that had mass MMR immunization campaigns have low rates of COVID.

Merck is coming out with an oral tablet that appears to be a very promising treatment and possibly, a cure for COVID.  Other new treatments are coming too.",lvflrq,2021-03-12 01:57:29
"* ""my country's gouvernement clearly said it didn't protect you from the covid, only protected you from the aggravated effects of the virus.""

Care to cite the source of this claim beside I would rather trust a health expert (like the chief medical officer, an epidemiologist or someone in the medical field) than someone in the government.

*  ""2nd of all, the vaccine is very recent so we may not know the problems of it yet. Maybe it gives out a deadly disease, but only after a year? It might not, but it can have negative side effects still not discovered.""

So far, those who received the vaccine (either Pfizer, Mordena and AstraZeneca) have experience mild symptoms such as headaches, fever and numbness in the injection area plus those who's experience serious side effects can be linked to those that have a pre-existing health condition and not the vaccine itself and on top of that, having a fever after receiving a vaccine is completely normal as that a clear indication that the vaccine is doing what it suppose to be doing.

*   To finish, since we already know it gives out side effects, I do not see the utility of the doing the vaccine as a healthy human being. If you are in a very bad health position, it can be a good idea to vaccinate yourself, but if you are in a respectable enough range for the virus not to cause severely negative effects on you, the vaccine is not necessary, since it doesn't protect you 100%, the only thing you will get is a bunch of weird side effects.

That's defeat the entire point of a vaccine. Those that are indeed healthy can still get infected with COVID-19 plus the reason why it's may not seem like it doing anything is because they yet to do a mass vaccination drive to achieve herd immunity. For a vaccine to be proven effective in acquiring herd immunity, over 70-75% of the entire population needed to be vaccinated. It's not required for literally everyone to be vaccinated as they're some who's unable to get vaccinated like those immunocompromise or have pre-existing health condition but the majority do. One more thing I need to add is that the sole function of a vaccine is to PREVENT a disease, it won't necessarily do anything if one already get affected by the virus.",lvflrq,2021-03-02 07:44:21

For the symptoms, I said I will wait. Because we don't have the full list of possible symptoms, no long-term symptoms... and we still don't really know the effectiveness of the vaccine, because it's so new.

Autism is not a problem is used often because IT IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM, the bigger issue is the fact that these parents choose to keep their children unprotected from preventable diseases and viruses that CAN lead to life long short comings such as mumps causing infertility and other such examples which in return, causes strained relationships with their parents and can lead to a decrease in population in general. Eradicated viruses are eradicated because of vaccines and should stay that way, not be rampant like the Black Death was in Europe, in fact that virus still exists but now that we have a cure for it (provided you find assistance in less than a day) it can no longer cause major deaths and huge losses especially because the virus lingers on a persons body.

"Once you say autism is a problem, you start to see people argue to ""cure"" or ""eradicate"" it, as if it's a disease. Following that train of thought further can lead to eugenics.

Or at least, that's my understanding of the situation.",lrvzpz,2021-02-25 07:14:48
"I would not use the argument like that perosnally. The main point is that vaccines do not cause autism in the first place. I think people say it only to people claiming it causes autism as an example. If for some reason all those studies turn out to be false or did not exist and vaccines did cause autism like these people claim, would that really be so bad that you would not vaccinate your child? If everybody stops vaccinating the chances of getting ill will become much higher bc right now unvaccinated people profit off of herd immunity. 

If all those studies that prove vaccines do not cause autism did not exist and the only one that does was not debunked, it should still not be worth the risk of your kid getting an easy preventable disease just bc of a risk of autism. People with autism can live a happy live, can live on their own, can often have a job. A bad case of measles can cause permanent hearing loss, but most dangerous: pneumonia which can lead to death.

They're absolutely nothing wrong with being autistic and it nothing to be ashamed about as I knew many who's able to live a healthy and happy life. Sure, it's hard to adjust but it's possible plus just because you have a bad or stressful experience doesn't mean the entire argument should be dismiss but rather it could be due to lack of awareness or understanding about autism or it's that you live in a neighborhood that don't care.

It just means that the person ticks a little different but doesn‚Äôt everyone tick a bit different? Autism isn‚Äôt such a terrible thing, it‚Äôs mostly just a reminder to take care of people. Mental illnesses aren‚Äôt too difficult to deal with or assist the afflicted and is certainly not that big of an issue to deny your child protection against viruses and sicknesses that could cause life long issues.

Harmful behaviors can be treated but otherwise I think many autistics believe their diagnosis is a part of who they are and would not want to be cured.

Also, I believe autism is considered a disability, which is not the same as a mental illness. Trying to eradicate disability is where eugenics can come into play.

If in some kind of made up senario vaccines caused autism it would deff not be a 100% chance. (bc that 1 studie said it did and it was deff not 100%). which means it would be worst case scenario to happen when you get a vaccine in that case. (Unless you are extremly allergic but that is very rare). If everyone would stop vaccinating their kids bc they are scared of autism a lot more children would get the measles and die. both are worst case scenario so compareble.

This is a very good resume (review) about the studie and how it got debunked: [review link](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/index.php/content/articles/do-vaccines-cause-autism) . I am trying to find a % the studie gave but I can't find it right now. The conclusion might have just been: there is a relationship. In the end the guy made up the numbers himself about who had it and who didn't. The outcome of not vaccinating would be very different per region. it depends on how many people actually got the vaccine in your area. 20 years ago mainly very strict religious people whould get measles.

"**A Multidisciplinary Discussion Among Experts on Issues Surrounding COVID-19 Vaccines**

About this Event

IF THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHOULD!

Should me and my family get vaccinated? Is it safe? What happens if I don‚Äôt get vaccinated? Why am I not given priorities to vaccination? How do decisions made by the governments and big companies affect our vaccination access? ü§î

As the pandemic stretches on into the new phase where the vaccines have been developed, questions about **safety, distribution and ethics** are hotly debated. Relevant issues revolving around **equality, free will and geopolitics** also emerged. üó£

In this multidisciplinary panel discussion, we invited experts from the fields of **philosophy, public health, public policy, medicine, bioethics, political economy and law** to discuss the **most in-demand questions revolving around the vaccines**, addressing your doubts and debunking falsehoods. ‚ÄºÔ∏è

You will walk away with a more informed mind, and are able to make a more educated decision for yourself, your family and your country. üß†üí°

Join us on Saturday, March 6, where we bring together international experts from different industries to discuss on the issues surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines, just as they are being rolled out. üî•

REGISTER HERE: [https://myphilsoc-vaccine.eventbrite.com/?aff=RedditCOVID19](https://myphilsoc-vaccine.eventbrite.com/?aff=RedditCOVID19)

Some **issues that will be discussed** include:

üíâ What are your opinions on expedited trials and manufacturing processes of vaccines? Should people avoid vaccination due to its expedited manufacturing process?

üíâ For people who reject vaccinations, what are the spectrum of reasons? Are they all anti-vaxxers?

"Of course. But it's because polio has been around for literally nearly as long as we can trace back sapien lineage.
So we knew its effects, we learned to formulate treatments and eventually a vaccine with advent of modern medicine

The fear with covid isn't it's virulence, if it was at the level of polio it's game over looking at how terrible our response has been to this basic pandemic.

With zoonotic diseases, we have little immunity and protection, we don't know it's ramifications and eventual chronic complications. We have little means to quickly form vaccines.

The only reason we were able to make a vaccine this fast was because people have been working on covid related vaccines since sars.

So virulence wise yeh, it's no way near polio. But overall impact potential? It's worse than polio. It's called context, history and science is nuanced and complex, who knew?",lo5b8q,2021-02-20 22:29:43

goodness finally someone with a brain.,lo5b8q,2021-02-21 11:38:07
Well said and I‚Äôd love to address all your points . First specifically to the fact they have been working on coronavirus vaccines since early 2000s...if you look into those studies and trials they weren‚Äôt too effective. When the animals we‚Äôre exposed to the live virus the immune system failed and they died at a high rate.,lo5b8q,2021-02-20 22:59:11

"No problem, chickenpox was something everyone got as kids in the US until the 1990s, and in Britain kids still get it because they don't vaccinate for it, the case fatality rate is 1 in 60,000

Smallpox has been completely eradicated worldwide and had a case fatality rate of 1-30% depending on the strain, with the worse strains being more common",lo5b8q,2021-02-21 04:20:06
"Yeh..... And what's your point? You're just explaining the literal scientific process.

Science isn't some magic spell you use.
It's a compound of years of failure amounting to minor success after deacdes. Have you ever worked on a research paper? Because I have and science is a crappy grueling laborious work that usually nets nothing .

Then someone smarter than I build on that.

Like what happened with the vaccine.

What is your point other than displaying your warped understanding of science?",lo5b8q,2021-02-21 17:37:11
"Look, I'm a junior doctor. I read on this and can understand it but will likely misrepresent it heavily if I try to explain the nuanced areas of this. (Primary because it's really more microbiology and epidemiology than clinical)

But core of it is, when there is a new zoonotic transfer of a subtype of a virus or bacteria, it's always a massive concern.

Lets talk clinical, because I know this one. Still when we talk about covid, all doctors know we are talking hypotheticals, everything is hypothetical, everything is using proxy measures and extrapolated science. We don't know the short term chronic effect, we don't know the long term chronic effects.
This heavily alters our ability to combat this illness, we need to treat it differently from even other known more dangerous and virulent diseases because we just don't know.

It's science, we didn't just magically acquire knowledge from thin air. It took us years to develop various guidelines, protocols for diseases we've known about for literal millennia, and even those aren't perfect. But they are adequate enough to be better than the control (doing nothing).

For generations People died, people lived their lives under a book, all so we can slowly over thousands of years build up knowledge that became the basis of modern science then modern medicine. It wasn't some magic that created knowledge out of the air. And now we feel vulnerable like those physicians did in ancient greek times, working with impartial information, over human lives.

This is scary because for us doctors, we aren't used to treating so much unknowns. It scares us. It should terrify you",lo5b8q,2021-02-21 17:43:24
I understand clearly and your condescending tone isn‚Äôt needed. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not possible. I‚Äôm saying we are still in a ‚Äúvaccine trial‚Äù are we not ? Wasn‚Äôt this faux vaccine given emergency approval to protect us all from the magic virus ? Oh and it won‚Äôt stop transmission? What ? They are literally rewriting the definition of vaccine.,lo5b8q,2021-02-21 18:15:59
"You both may be having a serious argument/conversation. But honestly, I'm just enjoying this whole thing ü§£",lo5b8q,2021-03-03 02:26:48
"I'm.... Sorry that I came across condescending, maybe it's because I'm sick and tired of telling those who claim to be frown ass people about fundamentals of basic science. This isn't quantum mechanics, you learned this in junior high.

I'm sorry if all the death and unnecessary outcomes because of cavalier attitude of morons who clearly dont understand basic science has worn my patience thin. 

Science isnt something you take bits and peices off only those that agree with your argument then confound it with your faulty logic, that's religion. You're thinking of cult formation.

Is the vaccine rushed? Yes. Are doctors worried? Yes, maybe go read the countless articles written from them. Is it still the best chance to curb this pandemic? Yes. Is the benefit greater than the risk? Currently? YES
That's why we are doing this.

Let me just correct a few things you have grossly misunderstood, I assume you haven't come even close to an actual paper and blabbering off some bs you read online.

So onto the actual non argument of yours.

1. The vaccine is a vaccine, what wierd fake news site did you get that massive idiocy from? 
2. It's a new type rna vaccine, it's a revolution that has reorganised our understanding of genesis of rna and even put doubts about our understanding of dna formation and thus genesis of life.
3. It's not a scam, it's a big deal. Just because you don't get it, don't make it false. Just because you're a moron don't mean we have to be.
4. Its currently on trial phase 3, phase 4 is to determine long-term side effects and see population wide effect, we don't have time for that so they are initiating it in community, thus emergency. 
5. It's still effective and it is still safe enough (this one is hard to explain, reading the paper would do you much better than listen to my abridged likely misrepresented version). Different regions have different standards on minimum required standards of safety because of course there is.
6. The efficacy is real and it will likely curb infectivity, it's just in science we actually care about the words we use and their meaning. You wouldn't completely misunderstand a contract then get mad at the lawyer because you can't read legalese, that's what you sound like. So when they say there is no proof it won't stop transmission, it's because they haven't and likely can't test that yet. 
7. Go read the bloody paper, I shouldn't have to be doing this for grown ass people. My teenage sister can read papers and appraise them, so can you.",lo5b8q,2021-02-21 18:43:44
There are so many things here to address. The fact that you are saying they are in ‚Äústage 3‚Äù of the trial after less than a year is flabbergasting. Skipping animal trials altogether ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,lo5b8q,2021-02-21 20:43:50
"If you were actually trying to make an argument in good faith I‚Äôd thank you but you arent. The ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù (mRNA) is clearly not a vaccine. You can parrot whatever crap you have been propagandized with but that still doesn‚Äôt make it vaccine. Like you said , the words we use have meaning so you try to use the words that best describe the thing. A vaccine it is not. They are literally re-writing the definition of vaccine. And for you , someone who supposedly believes in truth in language should be appalled.",lo5b8q,2021-02-25 13:42:26
"Yeh wow, how are you not getting this, did you not get the tone? Does that sound like good faith argument? That's the tone of a tired teacher groaning his last job away.

I'm not making a good faith argument for an arrogant brat who thinks they stand above the giants of science who brought humanity to the point where well, look at everything we have around us.

I don't parrot crap. I read the paper, I appraise it. That's the entire point of science. To take small ideas and build above.

Gravity was once something people observed as things fall. Then a genius put an equation on it. Then another genius found it's relation to space time. Now more geniuses are finding it's core particles.

Science isn't magic, it's a culmination of years of excruciating work, hard back breaking work. And how do we know it's true? Because of experimentation, thousands of them and observing them in the real world. Not relying on the whims and beliefs of randos online.

I spent my time in this amazing world with boundless knowledge learning the basics of science, literature, history, etc. And now, when I'm faced with a concept I don't understand, I don't make stuff up or decide on my whims like you.

I read the paper, I appraise them, I make up my own goddam mind. Stop deflecting, parroting means you're just saying what someone else said. Isn't that just you? Where did you get this info? From your imagination? From someone else? At least mine is generated from years of science and self thought. I have a whole army of scientists who will back me up on data alone. What do you have?

Edit. Tone may be too harsh, I'm not saying you're fears and skepticism are all fake, and that skepticism is good. But you're making arguments about literally things that aren't real/pure semantics or already covered by the paper extensively. The vaccine definitely has problems but you're just spewing complete bs

You can't bring feelings to a fact fight. I'm sorry, but this is science everything needs proof, can't just make things up.",lo5b8q,2021-02-25 17:47:14

I but what if they have a religious beliefs this new vaccine has aborted fetus cells which some people are against.,lo96k9,2021-02-21 23:29:33
"No, the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any aborted fetal cells. However, Pfizer and Moderna did perform confirmation tests (to ensure the vaccines work) using fetal cell lines.
But it's important to have the full context: Fetal cell lines are not the same as fetal tissue. Fetal cell lines are cells that grow in a laboratory. They descend from cells taken from elective abortions in the 1970s and 1980s. Those individual cells from the 1970s and 1980s have since multiplied into many new cells over the past four or five decades, creating fetal cell lines. Current fetal cell lines are thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue. 
Vaccine makers may use these fetal cell lines in any of the following three stages of vaccine development: 
Development: Identifying what works
Confirmation: Making sure it works
Production: Manufacturing the formula that works
When it comes to the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved for emergency use, neither the Pfizer nor Moderna vaccines used fetal cell lines during the development or production phases. (So, no fetal cell lines were used to manufacture the vaccine, and they are not inside the injection you receive from your doctor.) However, both companies used the fetal cell line HEK 293 in the confirmation phase to ensure the vaccines work. All HEK 293 cells are descended from tissue taken from a 1973 elective abortion that took place in the Netherlands. 
None of the COVID-19 vaccines in development use fetal cells taken from recent abortions.

"Not having the data on how the transmission is reduced ‚â† transmission isn‚Äôt reduced.

And that same immune system cannot stop

Measles, SARS, Ebola and many other viruses. Because it hasn‚Äôt been exposed to them before.

That‚Äôs what a vaccine does. It gives your immune system a safe version that it can reverse engineer in order to protect you.

Also just because it has a <1% chance of killing you doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs a good experience.

My aunt had to go to hospital for several nights and was on oxygen. She gave birth 3 weeks early and is still suffering lung issues.

My uncle still has trouble breathing.

But they‚Äôre not dead so you would consider that fine.

But it‚Äôs not even about that. By deliberately taking your chances you creating a vector for the virus to spread where it could end up infecting someone who will die.

And stay safe",lmr39j,2021-02-18 22:38:20
"Problem is, the death rate is not only 1% and you will kill others too if you infect them.

With the vaccine, even if it wouldn't stop transmission completely, antibodies will severely reduce it. While getting the disease will definitely be riskier to your and others, cause you'll be contagious for way longer, shedding a high viral load. Antibodies after the disease wane faster from what I noticed while following them in dynamic, and they're not in higher numbers either.",lmr39j,2021-02-19 05:44:35
"False. mRNA in this vaccine causes the cell to produce cv19 spike protiens in the cytoplasm, which has no effect on the nucleus or core functions of the cell.

"Researchers at CCR identified a novel modification in human messenger RNA (mRNA) that dramatically impacts gene expression. NAT10, an enzyme, was found to be responsible for the modification, which itself has been implicated in cancer and aging. This is one of the first examples of a unique chemical modification to mRNA (a key factor in deciphering the genetic code) that causes an increase in protein production. The study, by Shalini Oberdoerffer, Ph.D., Investigator in the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, and colleagues, appeared November 15, 2018, in Cell.

Deciphering the genetic code is a multi-step process that begins with transcribing information contained within DNA to a messenger RNA; the resulting mRNAs are then translated into proteins that comprise key components of the cell. It is known that RNA can be uniquely modified following the transcription process as a means to regulate function. This study provides a first example of a chemical modification to mRNA that enhances protein production. The investigators suggest the modification alters the efficiency by which the genetic code is read within each strand of mRNA.

The researchers focused on a specific chemical modification to mRNA, N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C). They first mapped the presence of ac4C to thousands of human mRNAs. In the lab the scientists next determined that the presence of ac4C within mRNAs powerfully enhanced their ability to be translated into protein. They further demonstrated that ac4C impacted cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer cells.",lmr39j,2021-02-19 01:51:43

The NNN crowd need to first ascertain how many people would die in the equivalent time period without any vaccines being administered, then compare that number to how many died after COVID-19 vaccines were administered. Then we can ask if anyone is being censored.

There was a string of deaths reported in Norwegian nursing homes after residents started to be vaccinated. The thing is, the rate of deaths during that time period was not different to the background rate of deaths in Norwegian nursing homes (https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/no-indication-of-causal-relationship-between-covid-19-vaccination-and-death/id2829481/).

">And this COVID19 (Pfizer) has had much less testing than any other vaccine I have received.

Little correction here : this vaccine has the most tests made on a single vaccine. However, it has been used far less still (kind of obvious), meaning we have less data.

As to how free people should be concerning vaccines, I am more in favour of mandatory vaccination than you.  
Even though there is no absolute rate for herd immunity to work, depending on the disease and many other factors, it is always beneficial to have the majority of the population vaccinated.  
Some diseases are so nasty that even when we have less risk of catching the disease than to have a side effect of the vaccine, the vaccine's benefits outweigh the low risk of catching the disease.

Finally, considering CoViD-19 mandatory vaccination. The first vaccine will probably be mandatory to obtain VISAs. However, if the virus mutates every year like the Influenza (the flu), I don't think every vaccine will be required.  
The immune system evolves, so someone with a good health condition doesn't need the vaccine every year, as their immunity evolves with the virus. Only major mutations would make taking the vaccine visibly beneficial for these people.

In my case, I don't get the yearly flu shot. Though, if a highly mutated flu virus comes, I'll probably get the vaccine, just in case. I'll do the same for the Coronavirus, and to people who don't have health problems and don't live with fragile people, I recommend doing the same : it reduces the vaccine demand, leaving more budget for other health things.

The original Chinese herd immunity calculations were 82%. We just don't know.   
As for the lack of immunity of Adults to Measles, see the citation below. Most people who  were vaccinated before 2 doses were standard for children may not have effective immunity. The infamous 'Disneyland' measles outbreak was sustained by infected adult park workers. Our public health response to Measles has generally been good, with effective contact tracing. Because measles is rare in the US, and responsible adults get boasters before travel to countries with ongoing out breaks, the herd immunity of the general adult population has not been tested.

Sure I'll admit it would be difficult to integrate in the society (due to the stigma, lack of education and awareness in relation to autism) however that can be solve with educating and acceptance.

"Let me take a crack at it.

Vaccines have been proven to work for over 50 years at this point. The first big break was with polio, which was actually an accidental discovery (like chocolate chip cookies and the microwave) and ended up basically eradicating the disease. Ever since then, we have been able to farm and cultivate samples of diseases to help avoid them. There are statistics comparing vaccinated countries and peoples to unvaccinated and it's a staggering difference. The doubt of vaccines mainly started once a doctor released a study claiming that it was also a cause of autism. He was quickly debunked by MANY other doctors and even lost his license for his false study. Ever since then, people have found similar but just as false ways to ""prove"" that autism is caused by vaccines. I'm not an expert, so I won't claim this is an absolute fact: autism has been around longer than vaccines. We didn't diagnose psychiatric and psychological things until Freud in the 50s I believe. Even then it took a long time to get more studies and diagnoses out.

Vaccines do not cause autism, autism is its own thing. Even if it did cause autism, I know I would gladly take a shot for a risk (not guarantee) of something that is not deadly (like polio). If you think autism is the worst thing to be diagnosed with, there are a lot of things we should also be talking about.

I hope this has been a very neutral and informative comment, not one full of ire and hate. I tried to keep it straight to the facts of the history and evidence of vaccines and the evolution of antivax. Also, this is a satire sub for antivax, so it's really a provax sub.",ljlc5n,2021-02-14 14:43:43

I may have a good life, but I also know from experience that autism causes problems that are nothing to do with lack of acceptance or understanding, autism would still be a problem even if everyone was 100% understanding

>Remember, autism isn't a disease but rather a disability as much as being blind or deaf is a disability.

"Great job ! Yeah I find the autism thing is sort of a ‚Äúred herring‚Äù but makes for great fodder. Regardless of any of the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that vaccine are safe and effective (often said in a blanket sort of way) there is a Federal Vaccine Injury fund. I never even knew this until about 2 years ago. Most people don‚Äôt know it exists and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a reason for that. Apparently (can be verified) most of the claims filed are overwhelmingly because of the flu vaccine. So my bottom line is: if vaccines are totally safe and effective then why is there a vaccine injury fund that has paid out millions upon millions ? Now you can try to downplay it all you like but it doesn‚Äôt change the facts. That‚Äôs not fear mongering( or whatever dumb ad hominem attack you want to make) , it‚Äôs just the truth. Some people are injured by vaccines and if there was more transparency around it from the drug companies we would be better off. 

Also I see people using polio as some sort of ‚Äú I gotcha‚Äù data point, as the penultimate reason to vaccinate. One covid is not polio or anywhere near it ( in terms of death or really anything). So to draw a comparison is a fall equivalent to me. Also polio was on the decline ( like covid) due to just plain santitation and herd immunity when they rolled out the vaccine. So someone not digging into the real data can just go ‚Äú oh polio declined when the vaccine came out hence vaccines are good‚Äù. That sort of thinking is reductive and not very enlightened.",ljlc5n,2021-02-17 11:58:19

"What would you call it then? A vaccine is usually a disease that is either dead or weakened that trains the T cells to recognize the disease, calling the white blood cells to eradicate faster. There's a few other formats, but the above is the most common way. Vaccines aren't all equal because not all diseases are the same. The flu evolves and mutates to an insane degree, HIV shuts down your body's immune response, and tetanus attacks your nervous system. It will never be 100% foolproof, but to be at least 80% for most dangerous/common diseases is better than nothing.

It's also harder to make vaccines for viral infections especially the common cold (which COVID-19 is similar to) since they're made of RNA and a protein shell. There's only so much we as a human can do to keep track of a completely separate species without putting ourselves even more in the line of sight.",ljlc5n,2021-02-14 15:36:53

"Their signs are no more misleading than the mainstream mantra that 'Vaccines are safe and effective'.

Yes, some vaccines use the ancestor cells of an aborted fetus from the 60's.  That does not mean her sign is shit.

The other lady is making a statement that nobody here can challenge as false due to it being a personal experience.  If you personally knew the lady and personally knew that she is lying, well, you could say that is shit.  Otherwise, you are in no better of a position than either of these ladies.

On the other hand the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program have paid out, as of a few years ago, over $4 billion in compensation to injury victims.  This is after a very one-sided trial system that rigorously defends the vaccines, making so difficult to receive compensation that most find it not worthwhile to attempt to make a claim.  Thus, there are many vaccine injuries.

So the statement ""How the fuck do they come up with this shit?"" is coming from a position of ignorance.  It is the result of years of you being bombarded with the propaganda that ""vaccines are safe and effective"" as if that is all there is to say about them.  It is far from being that black and white.",lfxphy,2021-02-11 09:08:31
"They‚Äôre not. 

What they refer to when they say this is that there are a small handful of vaccines that originally were cultivated with cells from two abortions that happened decades ago. Like the 60‚Äôs. 

Those specific cells are long gone, and the cultures still exist, but are not the original tissue anymore. No cell they use today was ever in a fetus. 

It‚Äôs also not every vaccine, which these chunderderps are implying. 

Even the Catholic Church, well known as hugely anti-choice, takes the position that using these vaccines is not wrong. Their statement is that sure,  it was wrong for the women to have aborted (they didn‚Äôt do it FOR the vaccine, btw, it‚Äôs just what the tissue wound up being used for) but that what came of it saves so many lives and spares so much suffering that the benefit basically outweighs the ‚Äòsin‚Äô committed half a century or more ago.  They recommend people who have a problem with it first seek out an alternative vaccine if one has since been put on the market that doesn‚Äôt contain the descendant cells, but that for the vaccines where there IS no alternate product, take the shot. The church reminds people that they have a moral obligation to vaccinate because we are required by decency and common sense to protect the life and health of our children AND other people around us.

If even the Catholic Church can say ‚Äòabortion bad but vaccine good, take shot Karen‚Äô then there‚Äôs just no reason to keep bitching about ‚Äòmuh feetul sellz‚Äô. There is no moral hangup for non-morons: ‚Äúgee, do I let living children roll the dice on dying or being crippled by disease, or do I make a statement about how high a horse I consider myself to be riding on? Yeah, imma do that. These babies and old folks and sick peeps are just gonna have to learn to like gambling. It‚Äôs the right thing to do!‚Äù",lfxphy,2021-02-09 15:35:41

But I still believe that most of the stuff those people were trying to convince you with that day was mostly incorrect, misleading or misunderstandings on their side.

And I also dont quite believe in any harmful dangers or consequences of vaccines that already went through the process of an authorization at least in Europe. Though I am critical when it comes to wheter a vaccine is effective or not for example the covid-19 vaccines of the british-swedish-company of astazeneca which has proven to lose it's effectiveness for people over the age of 60 I think it was

I dont know how many and what vaccines are used in the USA and what side effects they have and how much it takes them for an authorization. Europe for example is very strict and it takes a lot of time until a vaccine gets permission.

 I also know that vaccinations can have side effects, for example fever or headache, but these are just symptoms of normal defense reactions of our body when ever an unknown substance enters our body, and I also believe that such side effects are often exaggerated by those who oppose vaccinations.

I had my own experiences with vaccines and I kind of still have with them from time to time and never had any negativ experiences ( I help out in a  veterinary practice now and then) but of course thats something you can believe me or not just like the woman on the right.",lfxphy,2021-02-11 12:58:11

""We should have seen this coming. A 2005 article by the meta-scientist John Ioannidis carried the dramatic title ‚ÄòWhy Most Published Research Findings Are False‚Äô, and its mathematical model concluded just that: once you consider the many ways that scientific studies can go wrong, any given claim in a scientific paper is more likely to be false than true. The article may have attracted a great deal of attention and discussion, being cited over 800 times in the first five years after its publication, but in terms of scientists starting to make the necessary changes to improve the quality of research, its Cassandra-like warnings fell on deaf ears."" -  (from ""Science Fictions: How Fraud, Bias, Negligence, and Hype Undermine the Search for Truth"" by Stuart Ritchie)

In the review they looked for studied regarding whether the following vaccines cause autism: MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis

About MMR they concluded:

And 

>**The evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and autism.**

About diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccines, they said

>**Epidemiologic Evidence**  
>  
>The committee reviewed one study to evaluate the  risk of autism after the administration of DTaP vaccine. This one study  (Geier and Geier, 2004) was not considered in the weight of  epidemiologic evidence because it provided data from a passive  surveillance system and lacked an unvaccinated comparison population.

As for the family beliefs I think we are in a place that him getting better just reinforces their beliefs.  Hopefully with time and more data they will change.  I doubt it but one can hope.  PSA to all the vaccine is safe there is no factual reason that someone should not get it if they have any underlying risk factors.  Don't be in a place you don't have to be!  There wasn't a reason my Dad needed to even be sick.  It put a ton of people at risk and locked down the facility.  Don't be selfish, not vaccinating causes not only your loved ones to suffer but others you may not even know.  I made a mistake by not being more vocal although it most likely wouldn't have mattered I still should have tried.  These anti vaxers only see what they choose we need to make sure they have the facts.  Whether they choose to believe let alone look at it is another thing.

However some virus can actually ended up wreaking havoc on the immune system like syphillis, polio, measles, rubella which can cause long-term devastating effects such as paralysis, blindness, deafness, pneumonia etc. So my question is why risk facing that where one could basically get vaccinated with the only side effect is a fever and numbness at the injection site?

The calling people idiots definitely started in the meme, and before the OP posted the meme. In any case, and I am sure you won't understand, everybody needs their safe places, all of reddit is completely okay with calling vaccine safety activists names, and even wishing death on them, I am so sorry that you have all of reddit to call me names, but the thought that one place exists where you don't get to call me names is beyond your comprehension. It is a sub for people who are skeptical of vaccines. That is the premise of the sub. You do not get to attack the premise of the sub in the sub. Instead you run over here and attack the premise of the sub in this place. Their are many many many subreddits that ban me, for not even calling a person a name, but for stating a verifiable fact about vaccines that pro vaccine people find inconvenient. I won't do that to you. I will allow all factual content. What I will not allow is name calling and smears against the premis of the sub. Is that hypocritical? I don't know. I would say not, because I am not pretending to do anything else. It is a vaccine skeptic sub. Expect to play by those rules. Is it hypocritical for a makeup sub to ban people who critisise makeup while allowing people who critisise make up free people? No of course not. It is the basis of the sub to be like that. It is what the sub is about. Is it hypocritical for a sub about cars to ban people who are anti car and who smear and call names for people who like cars, while allowing people who like cars to call names on the car haters. No. Not hypocritical. It is what the sub is about. So no, it is not hypocritical, for the policy of the sub to be to enforce the standards the sub was set up to embody.  As always.

In reality as soon as Wakefield said ""I've got evidence"" they jumped on it and wanted to share it, as they knew the importance of such an announcement. What they did wrong was to trust that he wasn't a lying two-bit charlatan who'd modified his data, and taken huge payouts from multi-millionares who wanted someone to supply them with evidence that it was vaccines' fault their little darlings had autism so they could sue manufactures. 

The Medical industry responded brilliantly, jumping to fore to establish whether vaccines weren't dangerous to children, wanting to know the truth, rather than trying to hush Wakefield.

From what I've heard viruses are tiny particles composed of a protective hull and some sort of genetic material encapsulated in the inside.  
They lack any form of metabolism and features that would allow them to proactively move around or manipulate their environment. 

How, under these circumstances, was it determined that they have an intention and what that intention would be?",l8jn19,2021-02-01 12:34:01

You do, and that‚Äôs how we know you aren‚Äôt confident.",l8jn19,2021-01-31 19:44:08
"First of all I'll start by stating that I'm not a virologist, so I'm not an expert in viruses, but I have studied some basic virology in the past. Nevertheless, if an actual virologist would like to correct me on anything I'm about to type, please feel free. 

You are about right with your description of a virus, iirc viruses aren't even technically considered to be living organisms. They replicate by attaching to host cells, injecting their genetic material and using the host cell's resources to copy their genetic material and form new shells.

As far as an 'intention' goes, I'm not quite sure what you mean. Viruses obviously aren't conscious organisms and so don't 'intend' to do anything, they do what they do because that's the way they are; they will have a protein in their shells that allow them to attach to receptors on the host cell which triggers the replication process. Ultimately viruses replicate because they exist and they exist because they replicate.",l8jn19,2021-02-01 13:06:35
"You say that they replicate by attaching to host cells and injecting their genetic material into the host cell.

I'd like to know how that injecting works. If the Virus is a static particle, how would it ""inject"" something?  
It needs to somehow breach the cells outer layer, open up it's own ""body"" and then squeeze out it's contained genetic material into the cell.

How does a particle that is not technically alive perform such tasks? Is there any footage of that procedure, that may help me comprehend how it works?

By ""intention"" I mean what is typically being said about viruses.  
So ""reprogramming cells to turn them into virus-factories"" would be what I mean by intention.

How do we know that this is what they do?",l8jn19,2021-02-01 13:39:02
"Viral shells are made of phospholipid membranes, the same as the cells. These membranes aren't rigid and can merge into one another fairly easily. The exact mechanism of cellular infection can vary between different virus types, but typically it will first latch on to the host cell through proteins on its surface which will trigger the process to start to merge the two membranes. The genetic material is then free to enter the host cell.

I can't give you any clear footage of this actually happening as viruses are too small to see using optical microscopy, but this diagram might help: http://leavingbio.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/virus-replication.gif

We know this because we have been studying them since the late 19th century and there is a multitude of published scientific literature that you can read any time you like.",l8jn19,2021-02-01 16:20:32
"I don't think that the sentence ""we know this because we have been studying them since the late 19th century"" is a satisfying answer.

To me that answer at best means that someone, who has actually studied it knows this but not ""we"" as in you and me.

To me that means I'll have to take their word for it. And since you say, that there's no footage because the viruses are too small to see using optical microscopy, I assume that there needs to be some other way to derive the conclusion of what happens from what actually can be seen.

I'm always a fan of being able to describe something in my own words rather than referring to some literature that may have the answer. I consider referring to outside-sources as very disruptive to a conversation.

Another question that I tried to find the answer to is how viruses should first have come into existence given that they don't have an own metabolism.

I think we have a bit of a ""What was first, the virus or the virus-producing-cells?""-dilemma here.

If viruses can only multiply by first infecting cells, then where did the first viruses come from?

If cells produced the first viruses without being infected first, how do we know they can't still do it without being infected first?

How would we have to change our perception of viruses if this were the case?",l8jn19,2021-02-02 11:24:51

"I've been thinking about this and I have an answer, but it would take a massive concerted effort.

We need to go out and collect solid evidence. Say take polio. Collect yearly data about polio rates in each country and plot them all against when the vaccine was introduced. Plot autism rates as well.

Essentially take the huge amount (of sporadic and divided datasets) and manually process them into a clear concise simple to digest form. Show in a few images that it is incontrovertible that there is strong correlation. Then show that there is a causal link. Make a sourced, simple page which unquestionably makes the case: This vaccine is safe and effective.

Head it with graphic and emotive images of how terrible the disease was. (Iron lungs, measles, graphics plotting the number of dead as icons, not numbers)

Build it into a single page, starting with the simple images and detailing how the information was collected and put together. Source everything.

Take one vaccine at a time and give it the full treatment. 

Anti-vaxers will likely come up with counter arguments (it wasn't polio, it was a pesticide), but we have an ironclad demonstration of our argument. We don't need to pull out a source, we just link to the page for the disease / vaccine in question.

Slowly they will have less ground they can debate on (because we hold the game ender of debate on the topic). Not sporadic articles, not a dataset - these can be tackled on a case by case basis- but and end to debate on the subject.

This would take thousands of hours. It would require many people to put in and it would be emotionally less satisfying than arguing with anti-vaxers, but it might be more effective.",l6pbzg,2021-01-28 09:49:20

why does everyone think antivax is selfish?,l6jj4t,2021-01-28 07:37:51
"Because the only semi rational stance to be antivax (where you believe they work and don't do any significant harm), is to avoid having them because herd immunity will protect you.

It saves you the certainty of a sore arm and an almost negligible chance of something more serious.

As such you are being selfish that you are unwilling to take the tiny pain and risk of a vaccine to protect others (who medically are unable to take the vaccine).

While there were a few anti-vaxers, it made sense (in a heartless way), but as their numbers have grown, they've brought back diseases and now the risk of those diseases is so much worse.

Also there is usually a ""my child matters, fuck your child"" when anti-vaxers are asked to vaccinate to protect a child with a compromised immune system. That is a pretty selfish position.",l6jj4t,2021-01-28 08:09:05
Some people aren‚Äôt able to get vaccines for legitimate medical reasons. Vaccines keep the world safe for them,l6jj4t,2021-01-28 15:21:03
">Because the only semi rational stance to be antivax (where you believe  they work and don't do any significant harm), is to avoid having them because herd immunity will protect you.

Antivaxers believe that vaccines do significant harm, and some of them also believe vaccines don't work, people who believe in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are by definition not anti vaccine

Antivaxers believe that vaccines create a greater risk of permanent injury or death than being unvaccinated does

>Also there is usually a ""my child matters, fuck your child"" when  anti-vaxers are asked to vaccinate to protect a child with a compromised  immune system. That is a pretty selfish position.

Antivaxers in this position believe that they are being asked to endanger their children to protect others, I think many if not most parents would object to being asked to hurt their kids to save others

I don't think antivaxers are unusually selfish, I think most people would behave like antivaxers if they believed the set of facts antivaxers believe, and that it is an issue of information, not selfishness

As a personal example, I used to be antivax, and I thought for the good of others I should become more informed about the risks of vaccines so I could warn others, I was not being selfish, I thought vaccines were bad for everyone

I don't want to sound like I am bragging here, but the truth is that I have an above average background in science (not saying more to avoid doxxing myself) so I was able to detect statistical biases and faulty arguments that most people would not notice, and I stopped being antivax, however most people do not know how to assess scientific data well and judge sources of information based on whether that source agrees with their prior beliefs, rather than actually looking at the data, this is called confirmation bias

However, I should warn readers that pro vaxxers are every bit as susceptible to confirmation bias as antivaxers, as it is simply human nature, and pro vax misinformation is nearly as common as antivax misinformation, so you need to be aware of and try to avoid confirmation bias regardless of your stance on vaccines (this also applies to other beliefs)",l6jj4t,2021-01-28 09:00:00
"I am aware of this, what is your point?",l6jj4t,2021-01-28 15:31:48
"I think I agree with most of your points.

I would agree that most anti-vaxers believe (wrongly) that vaccines do significant harm and don't work. 

I also agree that anti-vaxers tend not to have the scientific literacy, critical thinking skills or motivation to find the truth.

I also agree that most anti-vaxers think they are protecting their children. 

I also agree that they deem informing others as a public service.

I was trying to justify why Anti-vaxers are seen as selfish and I stand by what I said.

(This is my speculation) Given so many antivax posts are intentionally misrepresenting articles or posting it without important context leads me to believe that they know they are in the wrong. This either means they are intentionally hurting other people or are being paid to hurt people. I have not met many anti-vaxers who post on Reddit who post content and debate in good faith. I suspect because anyone who does wouldn't be antivax for long.",l6jj4t,2021-01-28 09:15:40

I think confirmation bias combined with lack of scientific knowledge and critical thinking skills can account for many of the misinterpretations and contextless posts, and I can't even think of a motive for your average antivax parent to lie and hurt people on purpose, however it is very possible that some of the misinformation these people believe comes from online trolls or con artists selling supplements to counter vaccines",l6jj4t,2021-01-28 09:39:54

Viral vectors including recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentiviruses are used as delivery vehicles to transduce antisense RNAs to the target cells ([Danos, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866189/#R20))...     RNAi-based strategies are applicable to all diseases in which decreasing expression of an RNA, whether from a mutant allele or an aberrantly expressed mRNA in cancer cells, **would have therapeutic effects**. Great progress has been made toward translating the expertise of RNAi from an extensively used experimental tool to an effective and safe treatment. **The main challenges again are optimal delivery to the appropriate tissues and cells, avoiding the cellular anti-viral response to double-stranded RNA,** and achieving the optimal balance of high potency without off-target effects.

Injecting RNA into human body could have unpredictable side effects because these RNA could go everywhere.

Edit: The function of vaccine is to deliver the RNA of the viruses to human immune cells so that the immune system would fight against the viruses. 

> RNA vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence (the molecule which tells cells what to build) which is coded for a disease specific antigen, once produced within the body, the antigen is recognised by the immune system, preparing it to fight the real thing ... [https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines](https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines) 

How will the immune system response? How will not these RNA affect the immune system negatively? How can these RNA be prevented from going everywhere other than immune system? After receiving RNA, how will immune system interact with other human cells?

Having been antivax myself and then researching the issue more and becoming pro vax  got me interested in the vaccine issue, and this issue involves both science and politics, so it's only natural that I would become interested in this 

Also I found that there is a ton of misinformation on both sides, and I try to do what I can to debunk it, because I think this is a big problem

Switching from anti to pro vax only ""affected"" me in the sense that it got me interested in the issue, would you mind clarifying how you think I have been ""affected""?

This is my controversial issue account, I only use it to talk about vaccines and some politics, I don't discuss other topics on this account because I like to be able to discuss non controversial topics without having to be so carful not to dox myself,  so of course you will see that vaccines are most of what I talk about *on this account*

""At first glance, allergies and multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes may seem more different than similar.

When picturing autoimmune disease, you may imagine your body targeting cells in your pancreas or the protective sheath around your nerve cells - your immune system going on ‚Äúthe attack‚Äù against your tissues. Your cells become invaders in your own body.

With allergies, on the other hand, the ""villains"" conjure images of something entirely more familiar and every day, like.....peanuts. Pollen. Shell fish. Cat dander.  In other words, your body flagging harmless environmental allergens, or substances, as dangerous and then going on the offense.

**But both are responses generated by the immune system, and that is where their similarities begin.** Erik Wambre, PhD

Benaroya Research Institute predominantly focuses on the more than 80 autoimmune diseases 1 in 15 Americans live with, but another area of growing research expertise is allergies because where many people see differences, BRI‚Äôs researchers see parallels.

The CDC only recommends not taking the Covid19 vaccine if you've had a severe allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Then "" CDC recommends that people with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injectable medications‚Äîsuch as food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex allergies‚Äîget vaccinated.

Here's a review of gene therapy using mRNA, and in the conclusion they state very clearly ""no risk of integration into genomic DNA"". There is no conclusive evidence to support the opposite, but we are still in experiemental stages. They do state though that ""in vivo delivery of mRNA into human skin caused local gene expression"". That expression could be an inflammatory response, but it isn't clarified.  


What are some enzymes that have reverse transcriptase activity in humans? Aside from research on cancer cells ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2016.00006/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2016.00006/full))

It's not completely crazy to think that corporations could one day use people like fodder, as if they don't do that now. But there's a difference between healthy scepticism and blatant ignorance. Healthy scepticism helps keep companies morally in check. Blatant ignorance though, like shown here, causes humans to refuse to improve. 

Science is awesome, and we should continue to learn as much as we can. But as long as their are governments, corporations, and humans involved in it we do need to have some caution. Because in the end they have their own agendas they care about more.",l1ch8j,2021-01-21 00:41:46

also, assuming by 100-200 you mean 150 years, the population of England (where vaccines were invented) was 1/6 of what it is now, and transport being much less developed, another 35 years for vaccines to get to the USA (which I am guessing is where you live)  and then it would take a further few years to get vaccines recognised by the people as a viable way of treating/curing diseases/viruses.

"The argument with regards to autism, is that vaccines prevent things like meningitis, which can be fatal, so anti vax people who use ""but it cases autism"" as an excuse, are basically saying, ""ill risk my child losing limbs, and dying a painful death, rather than risk them being autistic"" 

I'm autistic and to have someone say that they'd rather have a dead child then someone like me is offensive. Not to mention the thousands of misconceptions about autism, where people don't understand that even with autism, I still lead a normal life, have friends and a family, I can still work and hold a conversation.",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 18:47:54

">Even the rare possibility of death doesn‚Äôt seem worth the supposed benefit of avoiding chicken pox (for example)

"Some (it may be a small number) pediatricians are anti vax now because they admit that formerly they just followed the schedule without question. So if we assume that a lot of medical professionals follow standard practice (which is understandable), then we shouldn‚Äôt assume they‚Äôve all done intense research on every facet of their profession.

The last thing I‚Äôll say is that the schedule seems to keep increasing both in quantity and frequency. Is there ever a point that pro vaxxers would be skeptical about giving their child 50+ (or whatever the number is) vaccines? Why, for example, do they need multiple rounds of Hep B if the mother doesn‚Äôt have it? It seems like an unnecessary risk to me.",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 19:21:14
Thank you. I really appreciate it. I truly do wish you the best of luck.,kz7wx3,2021-01-18 15:32:35
You are trying.  Really.  I care for people.  In the hospital we are surrounded by covid.  We are not scared.  We protect others with masks.  Everything is about the individual.  You live in America and you are the only person who isn‚Äôt narcissistic.,kz7wx3,2021-02-24 02:41:48
"Most antivaxers do not believe that being unvaccianted is dangerous, the antivax arguments I've heard are mostly about how serious vaccine preventable disease is rare and therfore vaccines have no significant benefit and a lot of risk ""I know vaccine preventable disease could kill or disable my child but that is better than autism"" is not the normal thought process of antivaxers as far as I can tell

It bothers me that people have started saying ""there is nothing wrong with autism and if you disagree you are a bigot""

I totally agree with the second part though, I rarely tell anyone in person I have autism because they might think of me as not able to function in life",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 19:25:23
You seem more like a bot,kz7wx3,2021-03-18 16:42:00
"I may have phrased it poorly. What I‚Äôm saying is that *some* things we inoculate against, like chicken pox, do not seem to me to be worth the possible side effects of a vaccine. I.e. I would rather get chicken pox than take even a small chance of an adverse vaccine reaction. But FWIW I‚Äôm not saying this applies to all vaccines. Obviously some possible diseases are much higher risk.",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 21:42:45
"Following the schedule ensures that insurance will pay for it when you get it.

It *might* be the case that it's even better to administer vaccines earlier/quicker than it suggests (i.e. if the schedule says I can't get a shot until next month, but I could physically handle it now, and I get the disease and die a month earlier than I could have been protected).",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 21:41:44
"You're greatly exaggerating the risk-vs-reward probability. I can't reliably determine whether you're doing that nefariously (to sow antivax seeds) or simply due to poor data. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it's the latter. In that case:

* [The side effects of getting chickenpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles) (which you have about a 1-in-3 chance of getting if you've been infected) is **way worse** than the minute chance of side effects from the vaccine (assuming you don't have a legitimate allergy).

>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study among 914 healthy children and adolescents who were serologically confirmed to be susceptible to varicella, **the only adverse reactions** that occurred at a significantly (p<0.05) greater rate in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients **were pain and redness at the injection site** {1}. -[Varivax insert](https://www.fda.gov/media/76000/download)

That goes away in a few hours. Herpes is forever.",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 22:49:48
"Okay, but again, it‚Äôs really necessary to vaccinate a minutes old newborn against Hep B even if the mom definitely doesn‚Äôt have it? Why the heck would we assume most people are going to get Hep B at some point? That‚Äôs ridiculous and, to me, a clear cashcow for the vaccine makers.",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 21:46:09
"Showing a lack of correlation is not the same as disproving one, which is my general skepticism toward vaccines. For example, if, hypothetically, some of these covid vaccines led to infertility down the road, but that could never be proven, people would say ‚Äúthere is no proven connection between the vaccine and infertility,‚Äù but this doesn‚Äôt mean you can rule it out. 

When some people say their child died minutes or days after vaccines, of course this is anecdotal, but they‚Äôre not making it up. I think it is nearly impossible to prove links between vaccines and certain medical issues because testing specifically for some of those links would be impossible. 

I‚Äôm not being ‚Äúnefarious,‚Äù just making conversation. I appreciate the data you posted.",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 22:55:57
"It wouldn't be necessary if we got enough people immunized to eradicate the disease. Until that point, the $17 they get for a shot (gross, so take the costs of production out of that) is hardly a ""cashcow"".",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 22:55:32
"If you're suggesting there is a correlation, the burden of proof is on you to show there is one. Data that show the expected result does not occur after the supposed cause then do indeed disprove it.

You: If I hold this stick out in front of me, the presence of water underground will cause it to dip, so I can show you where to dig a well.

Me: *puts a blindfold on you so you can't use other natural cues to either intentionally or subconsciously guess where water might actually be* Okay, now show me where the well is.

You: *turns out to be no more accurate than throwing a jart and digging where it lands* This disproves nothing!

"$17 x 3.75 million babies (in 2019)... not a bad little pay day, plus the fact there are multiple doses. You didn‚Äôt really respond to what I said anyway... why does a healthy baby need to be vaccinated against Hep B if the mother doesn‚Äôt have it?",kz7wx3,2021-01-17 23:11:00
"In the 1960s (I think... but it‚Äôs been awhile since I saw the documentary), there was a fertility drug given to women that led to many of their daughters developing cervical cancer when their daughters got older.

Maybe chicken pox was a bad example but I think you‚Äôre smart enough to get my point. I will still say giving Hep B vaccine to a newborn is the most anti intellectual practice our country does. Parents don‚Äôt know what Hep B is, they don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs a slim to none chance of their children getting it, and yet they give them multiple doses because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what their doctor recommends.‚Äù Google parents who claim their newborn died or became unresponsive after the Hep B vaccine. I guess the burden of proof is on those parents with dead children?",kz7wx3,2021-01-18 00:04:58

"Yes, despite your appeal to emotion, the burden of proof is still on them, since we have no way of knowing if the death ""after"" the vaccine was proximately caused by it or a Catie Clobes situation.",kz7wx3,2021-01-18 00:28:40
"Lol. So if my mom had me, and didn‚Äôt have Hep B at the time, her contracting it later will affect me? Then let‚Äôs start newborns on HIV medicine while we‚Äôre at it. And treat for scurvy just in case they ever go on a pirate ship.",kz7wx3,2021-01-18 00:20:00

"Essentially how a lot of the deaths had some correlation but no causation (namely the time frame), to cut a long story short, they were old and had underlying health issues, it may be a bad reaction to the vaccine but ultimately it‚Äôs just as likely it‚Äôs a coincidence since a lot of the deaths were confirmed to be completely unrelated,doesn‚Äôt stop it being used as anti-vaxx propaganda",kzegdr,2021-01-18 15:53:02

We do not know the lethal dose of either drug (natural plants or artificial medication). I fully believe food is medication, but I also know pharmaceuticals are treatments too. 

&#x200B;

Either way, these views are all very subjective and neither is right or wrong. If you feel comfortable with being healed by food and you're a firm believer, then continue. If you think you need the vaccine, go for it. No one can force anyone on anything. Opinions are just noise. Facts are also just noise most of the time. Do what you believe in.

"I'm pro vax too, but this whole thing is unsourced and contains falsehoods

>**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

This is false according to world health organization, serious reactions are rare, but can happen [https://www.who.int/initiatives/the-global-vaccine-safety-initiative/tools-and-methods/reaction-rates-information-sheets](https://www.who.int/initiatives/the-global-vaccine-safety-initiative/tools-and-methods/reaction-rates-information-sheets)

>Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported.

You need to cite a source for this

>One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects**

This also needs a source, you cannot expect to be taken seriously if you don't link the study

>In 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability**

No, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 **reduced** manufacturer liability [https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/98/6/1179](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/98/6/1179)

>One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects**

Again you claim something with no source

>**Andrew Wakefield,** ...... is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**.

Also false [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mauricio\_Barreto/publication/254468384\_Outbreak\_of\_Aseptic\_Meningitis\_associated\_with\_Mass\_Vaccination\_with\_a\_Urabe-containing\_Measles-Mumps-R\_ubella\_Vaccine/links/548deb3c0cf2d1800d842001/Outbreak-of-Aseptic-Meningitis-associated-with-Mass-Vaccination-with-a-Urabe-containing-Measles-Mumps-R-ubella-Vaccine.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mauricio_Barreto/publication/254468384_Outbreak_of_Aseptic_Meningitis_associated_with_Mass_Vaccination_with_a_Urabe-containing_Measles-Mumps-R_ubella_Vaccine/links/548deb3c0cf2d1800d842001/Outbreak-of-Aseptic-Meningitis-associated-with-Mass-Vaccination-with-a-Urabe-containing-Measles-Mumps-R-ubella-Vaccine.pdf)

>The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of  horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of  mass psychogenic events

Yet again no source...

>The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals

No source

>The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in  children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and  thoroughly investigated for safety

No source

>\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of  carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no  issues have been found.

No source, I'm honestly starting to wonder if you are an antivaxer trying to make fun of pro vaxers by claiming vaccines perfectly safe without any sources

>It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of  allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

You really need to cite sources for a claim like this, vaccines aren't even designed to prevent allergies

>It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer

No source

>Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

I think this may be true but you need a source

>France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has  higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed  countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

Source?

Tetanus vaccines are recommended every 10 years, so you may want another depending on how long it's been, you also would be due for a Tdap for protection against pertussis since you have only had 5 pertussis shots, (supposed to have 6) but again, covid is a bigger threat, and the precautions for covid also reduce risk of pertussis, so If it were me I would wait till after covid

There's countless documents, articles, pictures and videos of Klaus Schwab at benefits and dinners, exchanging money & prizes between The Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum.  Everything about his project has to do with Vaccines, the planning of a coronavirus outbreak, the ID2020 initiative, 5G, as well as racism and ""equality"".  


Do you force yourself not to look or what?  
I was hoping this was all nonsense when it started, but there's literally too much evidence for all of this to just be happenstance.  There's no other reason to link all of these issues together.  There's literally no such thing as a racist virus or one that goes out of it's way to uncover race issues in society.  I have a bachelor's of science in genomics.

"Did you make an account today just to do this? Also I'm not sure why advances in tech that have been coming for years now is a sign this is a plan.  These are all valid concerns that have been discussed over this whole year.  This article was written a month ago. Why wouldn't they discuss all the things that people have been talking about in connection to the virus? I'm not sure why they wouldn't be grouped together.  COVID-19 has created challenges that countries have to deal with.  Is the alternative to do nothing and allow countries that do decide to cope just pull away? I'm not advocating for chips in people but I'm not sure what this article presents other than that people have had to deal with covid. I've worried about self driving cars taking jobs away from Truck drivers for a long time. Also the spread of AI and more automation is and will eventually lead to a world where most people won't be able to find work. I've been wondering about this for years.  How do we deal with that? Do we shut it all down or do we find out how we as a society can adjust to meet that new reality? That's what every industrial revolution has been.  

As for the comments about race it's not like the virus itself is targeting minorities but that the conditions of minorities in our society make them a group that is effected by it more.  Minorities tend to live in more urban areas which are more effected by the virus, African Americans are more likely to have diabetes and asthma,  both of which are conditions that make COVID more dangerous.  So no the virus isn't racist but inaction from citizens in preventing the spread can lead to a disparity in the damage the virus will do to certain communities.",kvuwoy,2021-01-13 03:52:53
But there haven‚Äôt been enough studies on this and it‚Äôs not like any true vaccine.,kvuwoy,2021-01-13 16:25:09
"""..just to do this?"".  What am I doing?

The article wasn't really the point, it was more to point out that there is a ""fourth industrial revolution"" that many people have spent billions of dollars to usher in. Klaus Schwab wrote a book about the agenda years ago, that's my point.  Bill Gates declared in 2010 that it would be the ""decade of vaccines"".  He's also ""given away"" billions of dollars to institutions and companies to create apps and technology to track everyone on the globe as well as scan-able implants, as you seem to be aware of.

I'm definitely not trying to ""do anything"", I was just curious how someone with all the knowledge of how much money has been spent on making this happen over the last 10+ years, including ""donating"" to all the largest news outlets to paint anyone who resists this as a ""conspiracy theorist"", could believe that this was all just some inevitable cosmic opsie poopsie.

"The studies for the mRNA vaccine have been done (in 2020). 
Also, the mRNA technology is older than you might think.",kvuwoy,2021-01-13 16:31:15
It's just suspicious that the account that is trying to convince me vaccines are dangerous was created today.   I appreciate you think I'm reasonable.  I try to be.  I don't believe most people are bad players and that conversation is the key. I know many people do struggle to engage with people and I understand why sometimes.  I will admit I know very little about Klaus Schwab.  As for Bill Gates his position on vaccines makes sense to me.  You create societies where illness is less of a concern they can focus on other developments that can create a more stable society for them. This has usually lead to a decrease in birth rates. Which would be a step towards curbing the increasing dangers of over population that we are facing.  I think a virus like this or worse breaking out has been a concern for a long time and not just something Bill Gates and others have brought up.  Mostly because events like this historically have been devastating to societies.  Look at the plague in Europe. Or that small Pox wiped out almost 90% of indigenous people in North America in about 100 years. Anyone whose job it is to create policy needs to keep something like that from becoming a reality again. It can't be something you don't plan for.,kvuwoy,2021-01-13 05:02:15
A vaccine trial is like 5 years . But everything is different for this and don‚Äôt ask any questions. Here‚Äôs the disconnect...most rational and intelligent people can acknowledge the criminal actions of drug makers. But somehow when it comes to vaccines ( for which they have zero liability) people assume that big pharma is purely altruistic!?,kvuwoy,2021-01-13 17:20:11
"The trials done last year are what we've got. It's not to say that there'll be nothing else done with regards to them. But so far, things are looking very well. 

You are looking for something wrong, have at it. But don't go around putting unfounded doubts in people's minds because you yourself have trust issues with the new vaccines.

The true disconnect is thinking that the vaccine manufacturers would purposely endanger the first responders in society or even purposely endanger the people that they are actually gaining profits from.


Edit: missed a word",kvuwoy,2021-01-13 18:02:42
"Unfounded doubts ? There have been numerous side effects documented. So how can you say i have unfounded doubts when we are dealing with a jab that won‚Äôt reduce transmission, won‚Äôt prevent infection, and may not give long immunity (just to name a few) . 

Look at any vaccine trial in the past. Years and years with animal trials , then human trials. They skipped the animal and did one phase of human testing. Likewise you shouldn‚Äôt be blindly promoting a jab (that hasn‚Äôt been properly tested) just because well it ‚Äúscience‚Äù and you are afraid. 

I mean do we even need a vaccine for something with a lower than 1% mortality? I think you need to look at the data a bit more. The people who need the vaccine are old with co morbidities. Only problem is they never tested it on those people to make sure it‚Äôs safe.",kvuwoy,2021-01-14 14:42:27
Also if you can understand how unreliable the PCR test is then the whole stack of cards begins to fall ‚úåÔ∏èüò∑,kvuwoy,2021-01-14 15:02:05
"Yup, still unfounded.
Side effects come with 99% of vaccines.
The jab will in fact reduce transmission & prevent infections. 
We're yet to see about the length of immunity but even if it's short term, isn't that how it is with the flu vaccine?? 
Vaccine trials in the past didn't occur because of emergency situations like this pandemic, so of course they weren't sped up. But as soon as everyone is interested, resources flow like water. 
Don't be shocked by what humans are capable of when they put their minds to it üòâ 

My understanding here is that people fear this particular vaccine the most, claiming it will most certainly do harm. There's no proof of that.
All the proper phases were done. The difference this time is that they were all done almost simultaneously.
You have false info leading to your doubts.
The vaccines have been properly tested. 

The sensitivity and specificity of PCR tests are over 95%. Most of the false negative results are due to improper sample collection.

There are currently over 90 million cases and 2 million deaths, and these numbers are still rising! Doesn't that mean anything to you? 
Are you so disconnected from your fellow humans? Do we all not deserve to live? And if the vaccine will help us live, should we not take it? 

There's no point talking to you about this. As I said, you're looking for something to hold on to and you've been blinded by disinformation.

No one can force me to take the covid vaccine, but I agree with measures that would force me into situations that should make me prefer the vaccine.  In my case, it would be my dentist refusing to continue treatment unless I consent to the vaccine.

It was selected to ensure that good Roman Catholics would obey their priests through fear and dread of the future. Neither Luther, Zwingli or Calvin believed it to be God's word and the Authorised (KJ) Version included it on a split vote in 1611.

He is now 30 years of age, with no prospect of impregnating his wife and the tension could drive them apart.  Why should anyone feel responsible for their decisions and behaviour, only themselves?

If you refused to get vaccinated and for whatever reason catch what you did not vaccinate for such as measles, polio and now covid, they should at least get treatment but also a hefty fine for being highly irresponsible.

Most debated for many centuries were the so-called Epistles to Timothy and the Revelation.  As an example, there is no place in the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth for priests: every believer can communicate with the Creator, no need for intermediaries.

I agree. It is also very common for many drugs to not have tested it clinically on pregnant or breast feeding moms. Mostly because its expensive and difficult to conduct such a trial. Its hard to find subjects that are willing and then you get down to what stage in pregnancy and its such a short amount of time etc... they did not test the covid vaccine on pregnant or breast feeding moms so I do understand someone weighing the risk of covid infection over unknown covid vaccine and they should talk to their doctor about it.

there are a few issues I see with the facts however, first off measles has never been eradicated, if it was that would mean we don't need to keep vaccinating for it, measles was eliminated from the US in 2000, meaning that it no longer circulates persistently in the US, however local outbreaks caused by travelers may still infect several hundred or more people in a year, but eradicated means the virus has been made extinct outside of labs

Second the measles effects look a bit high, according to the CDC only 1.4% (around 1 in 70) or measles cases required hospitalization in pre-vaccine times [https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineDiscussion/comments/km8f03/measles\_misinformation\_on\_reddit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineDiscussion/comments/km8f03/measles_misinformation_on_reddit/)

Because dead vaccines induce a weaker immune response. The immune system has evolved not to waste resources and so will not mount an adaptive response against any stimulus. Most infections end with innate immune cells and do not mount a strong adaptive response.

Oh, you're a vaccinologist? Immunology expert? Could you provide sources please?

>Are you telling me it can't be improved at all??

1 in 900 000 plus 1 in 1 000 000 is remarkable safety. Anaphylaxis is sadly something that vaccines can cause, just as insect bites/stings.

Although I understand that viewpoint, perhaps the safety of this and future generations kind of outweighs the freedom to choose in the particular case of disease vaccination. 

Due to the need for mandatory usage for it's effectiveness, I agree that the science should be totally transparent and as much as possible should be done to ensure people that it is as safe as the doctors and researchers have found it to be.

And, here's the most important part: not all of those antibodies are protective, meaning that some are not 'immune'.  So the question must be asked, why is that?  The answer, from the immunological perspective, is that coronaviruses use a mechanism to infect their specific host cells which a whole lot of people will not make antibodies against.  That mechanism is what the vaccines target, and so expect a whole bunch of people who get the vaccine will not develop immunity.",kn8pma,2021-01-01 07:59:55

However, unless we‚Äôre conducting the studies or have the scientific background to analyze the data and the study methods, ultimately we‚Äôre reliant on those institutions to summarize the truth and provide healthy guidance.

That‚Äôs the fundamental disconnect between most of us and anti-vax/conspiracy theorists. We can‚Äôt argue over the facts because what we‚Äôre really arguing over is **who is trustworthy**.

"Is not vaccinating your children an option for you?  If not (and I seriously hope not), does she know that?  If you guys are getting serious, make sure you‚Äôre having conversations like these about how you want to raise your children. No vaccinations may mean that you‚Äôll have to home school, and that many options like club sports are no longer an option.  And, if you do find in person schools for your children to attend, (ignoring all scientific reasons for vaccinations), are you prepared to hear ‚ÄúJoey said his mommy doesn‚Äôt want him to play with me‚Äù or ‚ÄúAll of the kids in my class are going to Mia‚Äôs birthday party tomorrow.

Are either of you willing to quit your career and be a full time stay at home parent while depriving your child of these opportunities?  Not that there aren‚Äôt great ways to socialize as a home schooled child, but, if you‚Äôre not willing to vaccinate, you run into the same limitations as someone who‚Äôs attending school in person. No one wants to allow their child around the kid whose parents won‚Äôt vaccinate. 

Are you also prepared for a lifetime of people attacking your wife on a very personal level, where you‚Äôre constantly having to defend her while completely agreeing with what the other person is saying?  Are you willing to have her go her whole pregnancy unvaccinated, exposed to the flu, now coronavirus, and a whole host of other preventable diseases, knowing that a fever in the second trimester increases the likelihood of your child being born with autism by 40%? If you‚Äôre ready for all of this, and she‚Äôs worth it, then don‚Äôt give up.  Keep chipping away at her the best you can. If not, you don‚Äôt have to break up with her or anything, but you do owe her that honesty. Tell her you don‚Äôt want to end things, but that you‚Äôre not willing to start a family with her if she‚Äôs not willing to vaccinate the children. If this sounds like an ultimatum, it‚Äôs because it kind of is, but if neither of you is willing to compromise on the issue of getting your children vaccinated, and neither of you is willing to give up the idea of having children, it is so much better to get those discussions started now than when you see that second red line.

"""The word of the¬†Lord¬†came again unto me, saying,
Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,
Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.
She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,
Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord¬†God; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;
The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
For thus saith the Lord¬†God; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:
And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.
Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.
Thus saith the Lord¬†God; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord¬†God.
Therefore thus saith the Lord¬†God; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
The¬†Lord¬†said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;
That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.
Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,
And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?
Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
For thus saith the Lord¬†God; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord¬†God.""- Ezekiel chapter 23 verses 1 to 49.",kmjr63,2020-12-30 21:15:44

"The mRNA codes for a portion of the spike protein present in the actual structure of the virus causing COVID. Your body expresses this mRNA using its own machinery (the way it would for naturally occurring mRNA) to produce the this portion of the spike protein before the mRNA decays or is eliminated. The spike protein, now present in your body, invokes an immune response which (thankfully) prevails in long-term immunity. It‚Äôs important to note, though, that the spike protein alone is NOT disease-causing, but your body recognizes it as a foreign body. This way, when your body is infected with actual COVID, it already has the ability to recognize the spike protein of the true virus and immediately produce antibodies against the virus using its ability to recognize this portion. This allows for a powerful immune response more immediately that stifles the infection before it gets worse.

Some were skeptical that technology like this would work, where your body itself produces these proteins from code that is injected, but it turns out it works really well in this case.",kl70l0,2020-12-30 16:26:50

"> 1. ""The decline in infectious diseases can not be attributed to vaccination, but to hygiene."" 

Don't know enough about the link to hygiene to comment on it, but medical science & the condition of a specific country have a lot to do with how dangerous an infectious disease is.  
[WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/05-12-2019-more-than-140-000-die-from-measles-as-cases-surge-worldwide) did state ""This year‚Äôs modelling shows that there were 9,769,400 estimated measles cases and 142,300 related deaths globally in 2018"".  
However, when you look closer, that's a death rate of 1.45%, more than 7 times your ""[normal](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html)"" death rate you find in the USA.  


> 2. ""Vaccination against measles is not worth the dangerous side effects of MMR."" 

While the danger of measle obviously outweighs the dangers of MMR, that's not the whole story.  
According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html), in the USA, 3256 cases of measles have been confirmed from 2010 to 2020.  
If we remove the outliers of 2019/2020, we get about 245 cases per year. Works out very roughly to be 1 case per 1 million USA population.  
Compare this to ""the side effects of MMR and how often they occur"", it is not hard to conclude as long as herd immunity exists in the USA, the danger of MMR outweigh the danger of measle.

&#x200B;

Reading through the reports of outbreaks on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)  
\- it seemed as high as 18% (2015) of the infected are vaccinated  
\- most cases (95+%) were import-associated  
\- most larger-scale outbreaks happen in U.S. communities with pockets of unvaccinated people   


I don't ingest iodine tablet every day just because radiation sickness is dangerous, some dangers are rather irrelevant.

Don't know enough about the link to autism to comment on it.

A [quick google](https://www.autismspeaks.org/autism-statistics) tells me some scary stuff - ""In 2020, the CDC reported that approximately 1 in 54 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to 2016 data.""  


> 5. ""Vaccines are a big business and big pharma makes loads of money from them."" 

The whole argument with ""alternative medicine"" is just pure whataboutism...

The fact [this clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300aa-22) exists - ""No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988"" - just shows the evolution toward a model of acceptable collateral damage.",kl3gql,2020-12-27 22:52:57

"1. I was not commenting on disease severity, but on disease prevalence. Falling vaccination rates cause outbreaks to appear.


2. If measles was eradicated, MMR would be a real, useless danger. Measles is not eradicated and only keeping up MMR vaccination can keep it away. Remember, vaccines also protect those who cant get them through herd immunity. I'd be interested in MMR deaths if you have a source.

We, as a society, are no longer that sensitive/scared of the 2009 swine flu pandemic when compared to the response we had to the 1976 swine flu outbreak.  
Same thing with HIV when medicine advanced to the point where it is no longer a death sentence.  


2 - It is simply math.   
If the USA gets about 245 cases per year, and the US population is about 310\~330 million(2010-2020) - that works out to be around 1 case per 1.3 million.  
Using your data for measle - ""encephalitis... ...more than 1 in 1000 patients"" - let's be generous and make it 1 in 500 - that works out to be 1 per 650 million chance a US citizen is going to get measle and suffer the complication of encephalitis in any given year.

There may be some legal justification for neglect or possibly manslaughter (I think abuse refers more to active harm), but I don't know if this charge would work, and it seems unjust to punish someone for a good faith error

If someone who is trying to care for their child well loses their child punishment is cruel and serves no purpose

I think the only case in which it could be just to charge a parent for the death of an unvaccinated child is if you can prove that the parent knew vaccination was safe and effective, knew that there was a dangerous disease spreading in the area, and that the parent had the ability to get the child vaccinated but simply did not care.

It could go 2 ways, it could revolutionise future vaccines because of how easy it is to make and not that much has to change to be useful against different diseases (easier said than done of course). It could also go horribly wrong with only long term side effect which hasn't been shown yet in the current trails because of the limited amount of time.

What I am saying is that if you are not personally qualified to evaluate the evidence, you are also likely not qualified to evaluate the sources of information as reliable or unreliable (see dunning krueger effect).  In the case of vaccination, the medical field is not split on the safety and efficacy of vaccination there is a clear consensus.  That being said that doesn't mean that the risk is zero it means that when the entire question of risk vs reward is considered the overwhelming majority of the field has concluded that vaccination is generally safe and the rewards outweigh the risks.  So when a doctor goes against the field I don't think I should listen to him because he may be more qualified then me because I am not the bar for competence.  The burden of proof is not on me (not an expert) to refute his claims the burden of proof is on him to publish his results and demonstrate the validity of his claims.

This comprehensive and thorough list of facts will help you to counter and win any vaccine debate. If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:

\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**

\-One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)

\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**

\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported ""injury"" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**

\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.

\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported ""events"". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \*caused\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!

\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.

\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.

\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.

\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.

\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.

\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.

\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of ""conflict of interest"" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.

\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the ‚Äúrevolving door‚Äù phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.

\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.

\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

\-Autism is ‚Äúmore prevalent‚Äù due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50‚Äôs-80‚Äôs) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40‚Äôs and under).

"Control them? What do you mean by that? 

First of all, many people have been warning others that history does repeat itself. Are you in the United States Air Force? Are you in the medical field? 
How about let me ask you a few things. 
Why did Bill Gates hire 2 Harvard students to deliver 2 vials to Wuhan China gov lab? Why were those 2 students arrested? Why was it then, paid off and swept under the rug?
It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out that basically the richest man, a computer geek, climbs so up the ladder, that he decides to dip his toes into the companies that RUN the top developed countries (that are the sickest).  We‚Äôve also stated that we aren‚Äôt okay with our freedoms being stripped away. Some of us actually go and risk our lives and ARE REAL HEROS. 
It has been debunked over and over that vaccines never eradicated diseases. CLEAN WATER DID. Vaccines didn‚Äôt even come out after the illness was on the decline. Then they gave the vaccine credit. $$$
Create a problem, create the solution. 
Next, why are so many of our colleagues who question, or speak truth, BEING FOUND DEAD, and ruled as a ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù? 
Why are all of these gun shot victims and car accident victims in the operating room being labeled as Covid? 
COVID has a 99.72% survival rate at the worst. 
Did you know that Weve had higher deaths within the last 3 years, than this year? Check out the flu deaths. Pneumonia deaths. RSV, and compare them to last years and the year before.  You‚Äôre gonna have to get off of google and stop letting your TV and the CDC run the way your brain thinks. It‚Äôs a lot lot lot bigger out there. Promise ya ;) 
THERES a reason that over 45,000 doctors, surgeons, nurses are fighting this tyranny with truth. 
But they are being threatened. And killed. 
Also, if you haven‚Äôt seen yet, go look at the vaccine adverse reactions. There‚Äôs over a million families with the EXACT SAME STORIES. The Covid vaccines have had to stop several times because people are dying from the vaccines and having reactions. 
THERES a reason THERES a FEDERAL COURT just for vaccine injury and deaths!! FEDERAL! That pays over 4 billion dollars EACH YEAR out of taxpayers $. 
You get that there‚Äôs millions of viruses around us right? Do you know the size of them? Do you know the size of the holes in your mask? Think it through, come on. I‚Äôve got faith in you. 
How come you‚Äôre not afraid of the illnesses that there aren‚Äôt vaccines for? Only the ones we vaccine for, eh? And specifically ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù right now? Lol
Alright, that proves enough. You‚Äôre a main stream media watcher who can‚Äôt think for their self.  That‚Äôs truly a sad sad place to be stuck. Best of wishes.

"""The decline in infectious diseases can not be attributed to vaccination, but to hygiene.""

This is an interesting argument because it's absolutely incorrect. It is true that modern hygiene and clean drinking water were both major contributors to current health. But they alone are not sufficient to explain the drastic decreases of infections. \[1\] For example, the variola virus causing smallpox was a major killer until the Eradication Program and its successor, the Intensified Eradication Program of the WHO. \[2\] Vaccination alone can explain the eradication of this deadly pathogen which is estimated to have caused a stunning 300 million deaths just in the 20^(th) century. \[3\]

A more recent example is measles, considered eradicated in the USA in 2000. However, due to the falling vaccination rates, we are seeing a comeback of this dangerous pathogen. This would be entirely preventable by vaccination. Measles is unfortunately extremely contagious and so its return is very quick. \[4\] In this case, the anti-vaccine movement is literally saving deadly diseases from extinction. **If it is hygiene and not vaccines which holds diseases at bay, we would expect the resurgence of measles to be caused by decreased hygiene. However, our hygiene is as good as it was a decade ago, if not better; it's the vaccination rates that are dropping and bringing measles back.**

Indeed, anyone seeing the decline of infectious diseases as vaccines *or* hygiene is wrong. It is a combination of vaccines *and* hygiene.

"Sure, it is basically the overview of a mRNA vaccine.  However, something missing from these 'explanations' that you see everywhere, is that once mRNA is in the body, it isn't just magically preventative of future infection.  The mRNA transcript needs to be taken up by a cell and not destroyed.  Usually what cells do upon endocytosis of liposomes is destroy the contents.

Additionally, most other vaccines are not whole viruses, but are sub-unit vaccines.  Nobody has been growing virus for a vaccine in quite some time.  It is far easier to make the protein (subunit).",kgijap,2020-12-20 02:12:19

The medical communities drive to push a specific medicine constantly accompanied by the medical communities drive to keep the negative side effects of that medicine under wraps, and also come up with innumerable new reasons to take that medicine.

"Thank you for this. My wife is a midwife and I'm living all of this. Been together 8 years. We have an unvaccinated son as she is the expert of the house. Before kids we agreed on getting the proven basic ones. Which I now know was a lie to kick the can further down the road. This covid vaccine stuff has fueled an epic online rant a couple times a week. She once even said ""wake up people"" in a post. I've been referred to as a sheep swallowing the governments tripe more than once despite my ongoing support for her opinions and her right to them.

I dont believe she will ever change as she is deep in social media and follows fellow anti vaxxers/maskers etc. Reports their stuff all the time. She has alienated us both from our friends and family. We still see them. Just less and they treat us differently. Me included because of my support for her. It translates into me sharing her opinions to them. 

She throws info at me constantly and uses the blanketed term ""they"" a lot. They are doing this now. They are forcing that now. Sometimes it sounds legit and I don't say anything. But often it just sounds so unlikely. I say I don't believe that and need more info. And she immediately gets defensive than offensive against me personally. Turns into a bully essentially. As if she needs to be aggressive because nobody is ""waking up"" to reality. 

I've honestly considered divorce several times as I know this won't change anytime soon with the path she's on. Reading your post was nice as I always expected I wasn't the only one going through this stuff. It's so hard man. 

Life used to be so much simpler. We were in love. We have this amazing kid we have enough money that we are comfortable and by all accounts life should be great.

"That's really tough. My wife delivered both her babies with midwives, and although I can't say that I've ever done a survey of the field, my overall impression is that midwives tend to attract the same kind of clients as chiropractors: the person who's afraid or mistrustful of the ""medical establishment"" and tends to be receptive to conspiracy theories. 

I'm really sorry you're going through this. I thought about divorce a few times, and a few years ago, partly based on her anti-vax views, even told my wife I wanted a divorce. She didn't say that was a wake-up call for her, but comparing then to where we are now, I think it definitely had an impact and moved things in a better direction.

I don't know if that's good advice for you not, I'm just commiserating and talking out loud. I don't know how possessive and controlling she is about what your child learns or is taught, but you might consider a strategy of teaching your child how to identify logical fallacies, conspiracies, etc. If you can't change her, you can at least do your best to prepare your child, right?

A brilliant explanation of the Covid vaccine. 

credit: Samara Friedman, M.D.

WILL I BE GETTING THE COVID VACCINE?

The FDA approval of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines are an incredible feat of modern medicine, and our best chance to hopefully get our lives back to near normal  relatively soon.  However, it is new and it was done quickly, so understandably, people may be hesitant to get it; even people who vaccinate against all other diseases.

Will I be getting the vaccine?  ABSOLUTELY.  As a physician, I will probably have the opportunity to be immunized prior to New Year's and yes, I will be taking it as soon as possible.  

But, it is a new vaccine technology and done in record time, so aren't I worried about its safety?  Nope, not any more so than any other vaccine or other medical intervention.

Why?  Let's start with how this vaccine works.  This is an mRNA vaccine.  Past vaccines typically use a live but weakened ""attenuated"" virus, or dead viral material ""inactivated"" virus, or a piece of the virus's protein or even a toxin produced by the virus.  The Covid vaccine is very different.  It contains mRNA (messenger genetic material) that encodes for the Covid spike protein.  This causes your cells to then produce the Covid spike protein.  In contrast, when you are sick with Covid, the virus hijacks your cell to produce many copies of the entire virus.  Then it destroys the cell, busting it open to release its newly formed viral particles. When your cells release just the spike protein, it will stimulate your immune system to form antibodies to the Covid spike protein without you getting sick.  There is no possibility of getting Covid from the vaccine.  When your body is subsequently exposed to Covid, it will quickly recognize the spike protein and destroy it before it can make you sick. This was 95% effective in preventing Covid, which is an even better percentage than most other vaccines.  However, you must take both doses (about 3-4 weeks apart).  

Am I concerned about it being new?  And previously untested?  No, I'm not.  This type of technology is not entirely new.  It has been studied and used in cancer research.  They have been making mRNA vaccines and studying them to specifically target proteins on tumor cells and train your immune system to then destroy the tumor.  In this case, it is not a vaccine in the preventive sense, as it is targeted to a tumor that you already have.  It is not currently widespread because it has to be custom made for each tumor.  But, it has been ""around the block"" for a while now.  The technology was also being studied for other Coronaviruses.  It never came to fruition, because the diseases never reached pandemic proportions, and then the funding dried up. The mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, and it does not affect your DNA, and therefore has no lasting impact on your cell.

Am I concerned about the speed with which it was developed?  Weren't significant corners cut in order to get this out so quickly?  No and no.  What was cut out of the equation was mostly red tape, and what was added was technology and funding.  We were given the genetic code by scientists in China to start vaccine production in January; before Covid was even documented to have reached our shores.  From there, the vaccine was developed from the technology we had from the prior Coronavirus and cancer research, and was completed in March.  Normally, there would be months of waiting for the FDA to even look at the work done prior to approving Phase 1 trials.  Because of the urgent nature of this, it was essentially put on the top of the wait pile, which cut out months of waiting, but did not cut any corners.  Between the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines (both mRNA, with a slightly different delivery system), they were tested in 37,000 people in Phase 3 (and an additional 37,000 received a placebo).  That is on par with, if not better than the vaccines currently available.

Aren't I concerned that the FDA is about to approve it, and there may be side effects that haven't been seen yet?  Nope on this one too.  We know from decades of vaccine research, since you typically just get 1, 2 or 3 doses and then you are done with it, that nearly all side effects from vaccines occur in the first 6 weeks.  Like other vaccines, minor side effects may occur(soreness at injection site, muscle aches, fever).  Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare, and again, occur quickly if they are going to occur at all.  As a healthy 40-something year old woman, my risk of dying from Covid is about 1 in 250 to 1 in a 1,000.  That is not a rare event!  And even if I don't die from it, I could have long term lung damage and other issues that affect my quality of life.  Because vaccines are given to healthy people (unlike medications for treating a disease that is already present) they are held to a much higher standard for approval.  My risk of having a significant adverse reaction from the Covid vaccine is minuscule in comparison to my risk with Covid.  In fact, there have been no severe reactions to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to date.

For the rest of the population (outside of healthcare workers or those in nursing homes), who will likely be able to get the vaccine in February or March, there will be even more time passed and more people who have received the vaccine to be the ""guinea pigs"" here.  

Anyone who is pregnant - it has not yet been tested in your group (although I do know that many pregnant front line health care workers are planning to take it).  For those under 18 years old - it is also not yet tested.  Moderna will be starting a trial shortly.  Hopefully it will be approved by summer.  But for everyone else, I highly recommend getting it as soon as you can; for you, for your loved ones, for those who cannot (perhaps because they are immunocompromised), for the many businesses that are on the verge of permanent shut down, and for kids to safely return to schools.  I will be rolling up my sleeve for it as soon as it is offered.",kelogx,2020-12-17 17:30:47

"A couple of things:

1. No vaccines for your kids?  That's child abuse.  Show pictures of polio victims, discuss 25% hospitalization rate and 0.2% death rate with measles (that's like a shopper at your grocery store dropping dead in front of you every 4-5 visits), and 6-60% mortality rate with tetanus (admittedly, it's rare).
2. Antivaxers are usually big on natural medicines (homeopathy, naturopathy, new age junk).  They typically doubt all aspects of modern/western medicine.  Ask them if they'd undergo surgery using naturopathic anesthesia.  Or maybe they had surgery in the past - find out if anesthesia was ""all natural.""  When they have a prospect of being cut open, all those fringe beliefs magically go away.",kelogx,2020-12-18 01:25:40
"I start with convincing them to consider getting the tetanus vaccine. 

Its one of the safest vaccines. Perhaps the safest.

Tetanus is a bacteria that lives in dirt, surfaces, pretty much everywhere on the entire planet. It can also easily survive the vacuum of space. It lives theoretically forever. It does not come from rust or a rusty nail, but rather the dirt and grime on the object. 

One more time for the people in the back: tetanus does not come from rust.

So once in your body through some injury, if the bacteria is in an anaerobic (oxygen free) environment, like deep in a wound or if the tissues starts to die even just a little bit, then the bacteria releases a untraceable neurotoxin called tetanospasmin neurotoxin. The body's immune system cannot possibly fight off the tetanus bacteria because it has a protective covering. The only ways to break down the protective covering are to autoclave the bacteria for an hour, or put it in an anaerobic environment where the protective covering then automatically releases the neurotoxin into the body.

The neurotoxin cannot be detected on any test. It is colorless, odorless and elicits absolutely no immune response. It does not travel through the blood so it will not appear on any blood test. What the toxin does is it travels up your nerves of the limb or body until it gets to the central nervous system in the spine. Once it makes it to the spine the neurotoxin chemically binds to and physically blocks the neurotransmitter responsible for turning your muscles off. The binding is permanent and irreversible. This is why ""lockjaw"" happens, and people can break their own limbs and spine. The muscles cannot stop contracting. The body or mind cannot choose to relax any effected muscle downstream from the binding site. It can also constrict your airways and you can suffocate yourself if you don't break your own neck first.


There are only two ways to not die from the tetanus neurotoxin:

1) make it to a hospital and receive a correct diagnosis (rare in developed countries), immediately be put on a very heavy dose of muscle relaxers and tranquilizers and remain bedridden and drugged for as long as it takes for the body to grow new nerves, upwards of 6 months to a year+, if they can grow back at all and if a secondary infection like bedsores does not kill you, or,

2) get the vaccine every 5 years.


Tetanus neurotoxin disease is 100% preventable with a vaccine. Over a million people around the world die every year from tetanus because they do not have access to the vaccine. In the US most people are vaccinated against it and will not get it, but the cases that are in the US are almost 100% fatal because doctors are so unfamiliar with witnessing the symptoms in real life they do not give an accurate diagnosis soon enough. Statistically, in the US, the people who still die of tetanus are migrant or undocumented agricultural workers and people who refuse vaccines.

I hope this helps! Good luck!",kelogx,2020-12-20 08:13:07

"No, I highly recommend you watch crash course biology on this, but as a sort of introduction your DNA is a master template, it‚Äôs a stable double stranded molecule that‚Äôs billions of bases long. mRNA, is a translation of that master template into a less stable molecule that your cells can actually read to build proteins. mRNA just instructs your cells what and how much of X to build. 

This Crash Course episode will walk you through it in a bit more depth: https://youtu.be/itsb2SqR-R0

Moving on to OP‚Äôs question, it‚Äôs unlikely that any already approved and proven vaccine will make the leap to mRNA. It‚Äôs not worth the ROI, when we‚Äôve already got safe, effective vaccines. 

However, I will say, because Shigella, Botulinum anti-toxin, and the Tetanus vaccine are all a special class of vaccine called a toxoid, that in itself is a whole biology lesson for brevity surmise to say it‚Äôs basically the markers for the toxin minus the toxic qualities so that it‚Äôs recognized by the body, it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll find mRNA to be useful. Presently, we use a special plasmid that was synthesized and shoved in E. coli to manufacture these, this is a very cost effective method of production because E. coli are easy to obtain, easy to insert plasmids into, and most importantly easy to grow and dispose of, I personally feel that these toxiod vaccines are not candidates. 

I will also go on to say, killed vaccines such as polio & rabies are also not candidates as they‚Äôve been deemed to dangerous to risk as they could potentially kill someone, so it‚Äôs better to use the old technology with them in particular.

I also see a lot of misinformation about the new vaccine though, which is sad to see. Like ""they skipped animal testing"". It's ""completely experimental"". ""Alters your DNA"".

"Agreed with PP. While I‚Äôm not sure about any statistics as far as numbers of antivaxxers, I do know a lot of provaxxers who are hesitant about getting the vaccine because of the rapid development. I cannot wait to get my vaccine, personally, and my whole family feels the same, but my brother in law is a cop, which gives him and everyone he works with early access to the vaccine. He‚Äôs the only person in his department who plans to take it. Similarly, I read a post here from a nurse at a hospital in Michigan whose hospital was polled to show that only 60% of the hospital employees planned to get vaccinated. 

It‚Äôs sad, but people hear that the development time was cut down from ten years to less than one, and, on paper, that sounds scary.

So I don‚Äôt think covid 19 has made more people ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù in general, some are just mistrustful of this particular one.

"Yeah so I see this posted a lot, and my response to this is always the same: **what about the long term effects of COVID?‚Äù**

Some Covid-19 survivors have reported a variety of problems weeks or months after testing positive.
Even young adults have suffered long-lasting symptoms such as shortness of breath, chronic fatigue, brain fog, long-term fever, coughing, memory loss, and the inability to taste or smell.
One CDC study found 35% of survivors surveyed still had symptoms two to three weeks after their coronavirus tests:

‚Ä¢ In the 18-to-34 age group, 26% said they still had symptoms weeks later.
‚Ä¢ In the 35-to-49 age range, 32% were still grappling with the effects weeks later.
‚Ä¢ For those 50 and older, 47% said they still had symptoms weeks later.

And the risk of death from coronavirus-related heart damage seems to be far greater than previously thought, the American Heart Association said.

Inflammation of the vascular system and injury to the heart occur in 20% to 30% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and contribute to 40% of deaths, the AHA said. AHA President Dr. Mitchell Elkind said cardiac complications of Covid-19 could linger after recovering from coronavirus.

MERS petered out, the funding dried up, and the research was shelved until it was needed again for SARS-CoV2.

"I'm not an expert on the mRNA subject but here are some counters to your other points:

>Why should I take a vaccine if i'm healthy and have a strong immune system?

* You're only healthy until you aren't.
* You may have some underlying condition that you are not aware of.
* Assuming you're talking about COVID since you didn't mention it specifically, there seem to be instances of auto-immune like conditions caused by the disease (e.g. cytokine storm); so your ""strong immune system"" could potentially harm you anyway.
* Even if you can become ill and come out of it without lasting effects, you may spread the disease to others who won't have such good outcomes.

>I believe the best way to develop immunity is naturally

Only if you survive, have no long lasting negative effects, and don't spread it to others who have negative outcomes.

>don't feel comfortable taking something that was rushed out in 7 months

The main thing that was done to save time was to parallelize the safety/efficacy testing and production.  Normally if a company is going to make a vaccine they will come up with their agent, then test if for safety and efficacy, and then once the testing and approval are done they will move into mass production.  This is the obvious course to take since you wouldn't want to make hundreds of millions of doses of a vaccine that is dangerous or doesn't work.  However, since we want a COVID vaccine as soon as possible, governments have provided financial guarantees to these companies so that they can start mass producing the vaccine *while* testing is going on, and if it turns out that the vaccine can't be used those governments will compensate the companies for all of the useless vaccine they produced.  The vaccines are still going through the required testing phases, and will likely be some of the best-tested vaccines ever produced due to the large size of the test pools.

>company set to make billions and billions of dollars.

We may differ on our beliefs on this but I don't see why, at least presupposing a capitalist system, this is a bad thing. There is a very contagious, potentially fatal disease, and companies that can produce a safe, effective vaccine have every right to be compensated for doing that.  Also, depending on how your particular country/location works, most of that money is going to be paid anyway through purchases by governments, companies, insurance, etc. and you're refusal to get the vaccine will have no effect on how much the company makes.",kd0b65,2020-12-14 17:34:58
"Most vaccine testing takes less than a year. What makes it take longer are two thing: waiting for open testing schedule and productions.

Being that it's for a current pandemic, the schedules are being shuffled to let these vaccines cut in line with all others, reducing perhaps years from the timetable. They are also allowed to produce the vaccine while it's being tested, those which fail are then tossed out and the company developing those which fail are compensated very little for those lost dosages.

The release of this vaccine will also be as it's made, no waiting for massive numbers of doses before they ship. This is why we're talking about priority of those who get it, because it will trickle in slowly now that we have two which have passed the testing phase.

They are not cutting corners or rushing the testing procedures, they are just giving these vaccines a priority. The companies have a lot to lose if these vaccines don't pass, but even the corporations know how important it is to stop this virus.",kd0b65,2020-12-14 19:06:51
"It's because you can get other, weaker, less healthy people sick.",kd0b65,2020-12-14 20:30:05
"Why should I buy insurance if I haven't crashed? Having a strong immune system is even better if you want to take the vaccine. You will be less likely to suffer adverse effects. If you do eventually get the virus, your body can quickly recover and this can also slow any spread of the virus.",kd0b65,2020-12-15 00:58:32

"This answer pretty much covers it imo.

This vaccine is a modification of previous covid/sars vaccines therefore it doesn't need the same scrutiny as brand new vaccines, its like the flu jab, that changes every year slightly to deal with new strains of flu.

Developing your own immunity is a really flawed argument, it's your opinion and that's fine, but as in the above reply, you're only healthy until you aren't, some things you'll be able to deal with and some things you won't, but you won't know until it happens, plus again, as above, you're not just taking it for you, your taking it for EVERYONE you come in contact with who doesn't have a strong immune system, I've an 85 year old uncle who has COPD, if he gets covid  he's dead no question, him and my auntie have been in quarantine since March, terrified to go out because they know the risks, it just takes one of them to come into contact and they're both goners.",kd0b65,2020-12-14 18:07:55

But where it gets crazy is that the police are trying to grab the power to raid homes to enforce gathering prohibitions, which is a straight out violation of the inviolability of the place of residence (enshrined in the major two Human Rights Charters).

>Lead with your head not your heart

That's what science is already doing; help us make decisions that are sound, logical and not blinded by human emotions.

The problem is, vaccine skeptic will point to pseudo-scientific articles that are not peer-reviewed or worst, have already been refuted, and take it as word of truth.

At that point, it's no longer a debate about vaccines, it's a debate about the scientific method and the science community. The only discussion that will ever happen is for us to point out that the flaws in their arguments and the fact that they rely on weak/discredited sources. Only to have them counter that we're ""blinded by propaganda"" or that we're ""in bed with big pharma"" while providing the same, worthless articles..

All this could be avoided if skeptics would learn and accept the scientific method (the same one used to build the car they drive or design the phones' they use to join their anti vaxx facebook groups) while making sure to open a book on the subject.

This would teach them that, although most of the literature argues against their beliefs, their hope may lie within the vaccine injury argument and they should research *that*. 

But, my feeling from the handful of arguments I've had with skeptics is that they would rather be right at all costs, no matter how crazy/dumb they sound, than admit they're wrong or don't know something. 

TLDR: Can't have healthy discussions with people that are closed minded or want to discuss it while comparing apples (science) with oranges (pseudo, non-peer reviewed science).",k8ylt1,2020-12-09 11:21:56

"You misinterpreted me, I know serious injury from vaccines is rare compared to the risks of not vaccinating, and never meant to imply otherwise, my point is that most antivaxers are well meaning misinformed people, and accusing them of malice is counterproductive",k4cbs7,2021-03-08 20:03:52
"And like I said, when I meet them in a professional capacity I don't fling insults. I try to get at their eye level. My priority is for the patient, not my beliefs or my opinions. I will do everything to understand their viewpoint and do what I can given their fears to protect the child.

But on a public forum I will bash then till end of the earth and frankly after the damage they caused, it's the least they deserve",k4cbs7,2021-03-08 20:07:19
"And you say malic is counterproductive, but I've seen it work. Remember South Korea and eating dogs? Most of the population, especially young ones see it as abhorrent now. It came about from malice and shaming from the world. Yeh those people who liked  eating dogs are unhappy but I don't give a damn about them. And it goes with antivaxers. I frankly don't care if their feelings are hurt. I just want results. Sorry if that's a bit cruel.

I don't care about the method. I just want less children dead when we can clearly save them.",k4cbs7,2021-03-08 20:11:05
"I'm saying that even on a public forum misrepresenting their views as malicious and attacking them is counterproductive, however I am all for pointing out the many flaws in their beliefs",k4cbs7,2021-03-08 20:26:05
"Demonizing your opponents works in moral disagreements like whether it is OK to eat dogs, but the vaccine issue is a disagreement over facts not morals, both sides agree on the morals, they both want what is best for children's health, but they disagree on the facts",k4cbs7,2021-03-08 21:06:48
"Well then that is where we disagree (which is fine) I feel they need to know exactly the kind of damage they are doing and exactly how they appear to actual academics who study these for a living. (Their views are malicious, don't sugarcoat that, we look at results not people's feelings in science)

I have personally seen sugar coated messages from passives bolster anti vaxers. So I incline towards just saying the hard facts. Saying exactly how it appears to the medical staff.

But in truth I also believe both people like you and me are needed, the world is complex and vaccine aren't some cure all and we shouldn't die defending that hill.


But unlike some of you I was born in a developing country and moved to a developed one, I saw family members die of measles and meningitis, and frankly it infuriates me a few entitled morons who think they get the science gets to harm the next generation of children in a world they need not be hurt. So I will use every play in my book to ensure as many children are saved as possible. And if I end up the bad guy, then so be it. 

But my job is to save as many lives as possible, I think you either sympathise too much with antivaxers or don't respect them as adults who can take criticism. 

They should hear the truth. What they are doing is harmful and malicious and medieval. And it's wrong. I will concede many things but I will not sugarcoat reality",k4cbs7,2021-03-08 20:36:50
Ie. Intentions means jack shit when there's a dead child in front of you,k4cbs7,2021-03-08 20:37:16
"Not really.
Many people who still like to eat dogs don't see that as a moral issue. They don't see why it's wrong to eat dogs but it's fine to eat pigs who have a higher iq.

You think this a moral issue because of our cultural bias towards dogs. That sentiment means nothing in an actual debate.

It's the same thing. Some people will never see eye to eye, and sometimes we just need to shame and prod them to do what's best for the children. Like I said, I'm not trying to be nice or be liked. I'm just trying to save as many children.",k4cbs7,2021-03-08 21:26:11
"Also, It is most definitely a moral issue. Just because one side is rejecting reality doesn't suddenly change the definition of truth

I will concede maybe malicious is a bit harsh, but if people die from your actions it is at the very least harmful and for those who are in medical field it appears clear as day as simply malicious. That is unfortunately how science works. You don't get to pick and chose what you like and only take that as fact. That's religion

Long answer, you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.  It's an emotional decision like with any conspiracy theory.  They want to be part of an in group that is special and different.  They have to have that ""inside info"".  They will actively deny legitimate peer reviewed studied and authorities on the topic.  You will see the goalposts being moved right in front of your eyes.  Anything that can be used as counter evidence becomes invalidated in their minds and the reasons don't have to make more that superficial sense to them.

"I do want to just stop in and say a year or so ago this exact thing happened and they refused the vaccine. However, it is worth a mention that the shots they give you are not a vaccine. They‚Äôre a form of PEP (postexposure prophylaxis), which is a process by which an individual is injected with antibodies to a particular disease post exposure. This basically grants you a temporary specific immune response to the pathogen.
As you can imagine - this isn‚Äôt manufactured the way vaccines are, people who are convalescent (have antibodies) donate their plasma in order to save people‚Äôs lives. 

It is worth noting however; you should also take a rabies vaccine in this situation in order to ensure life long immunity.",jvclbs,2020-11-22 19:12:33
"mRNA is a substance that rapidly degenerates at room temperature, or when exposed to light, etc. It is unstable, and it is made to be unstable because of how it's used in the cell. That is the reason it has to be stored at a very low temperature. That should, by itself, invalidate the subsequent claims. 

There is no such thing as an AIDS-like virus, for AIDS is not a virus. It is a syndrome ultimately caused by an HIV virus infection. Claiming that because HIV virions have to be stored at these kind of extreme temperatures, everything stored at these temperatures is an HIV virion, is a modus ponens fallacy. It would be equivalent to claiming that, because if a substance is ice, it will be cold, a cold substance will always be ice. 

Also, anyone who has worked in a biological laboratory setting knows that most biological molecules (pieces of DNA or RNA, proteins, bacteria) are stored at -70 (sometimes -80) ¬∫C.

"I used to be, but am no longer, an antivaxer, so I think I can answer this

Antivaxers are pro-health, and they believe vaccines endanger health more than they protect health, antivaxers and pro-vaxers actually agree in that they both are motivated by the desire to promote health, they simply disagree about what is an effective way to achieve this shared goal

There are also peopel who are against mandatory vaccination but not against vaccination itself. I agree with this because I don't believe it is right to coerce anyone into accepting medical treatment",jugegx,2020-11-15 22:46:16
"when you identify ""covid related deaths"" as ""dying for any reason within 28 days of a positive test"" and you see how many millions of people theyre testing .. and the % chances that they will die within 28 days regardless of if they have covid or not.. all of a sudden this virus seems like an overhyped load of bollocks. So why would we trust a vaccine for this bollocks?",jugegx,2020-11-17 23:49:42
"not all antivaxxers are the same. some probably genuinely afraid of the ""side effects"" but aknowledge that without a vaccine they are exposed and vulnerable to the viruses, so they take extra precautions to protect themselves from being exposed to virus.

it is wrong to say antivaxxers just want to see the world filled with viruses.",jugegx,2020-11-18 18:25:57
"So a person could be pro-choice on vaccines and they get labelled with the anti-vax term.

Starting to think ""anti-vaxer"" is a stereotype the media loves to use. A person might be against a rushed vaccine and labelling them with anti-vaxer makes them sound like some irrational fool for viewers to mock.

Could it also be that too many different vaccine opinions are being rolled into one big protest and this could be a move by organiser's to boost numbers?

Like multiple protests in one just drowning each other out. Making it easier to call them the anti-vax movement.",jugegx,2020-11-16 02:20:46
"You missed the additional deaths statistic in that paragraph. It's just a standard piece of data that goes alongside any conversation about COVID deaths because it tells us that 2020 has tens of thousands more deaths than any previous year.

And the year is far from over! This stuff cannot be made-up. 

Ignoring additional deaths makes any attempt to debate a pandemic just a load of ""bollocks"" without a doubt. Additional deaths for 2020 compared to the last five years indicates that COVID is either the direct cause of death or causes a persons existing health conditions to worsen badly enough to kill them.

They may not have COVID on their death certificate but suffering COVID in weeks running up to their death is a scenario we would avoid with vaccination. Just like we save thousands per year with flu vaccination and as someone who has had the flu (ears ringing from it a year later) and potentially COVID (was as bad as the flu). I know without a doubt that if I had an existing condition that I'd have been close to death because as the healthy person I am. It was brutal and nearly put me in hospital. I can easily imaging fighting that virus off and dying from a heart-attack weeks later due to the stress it puts on the body.  

A lot of people are dying because they are completely knackered and ICU can only do so much once a persons body has fought COVID away. People are struggling to recover from the damages done to their bodies when stuck in a bed for weeks on machines. 

Are they not the victim of COVID simply because additional tests for the virus come back negative?",jugegx,2020-11-18 11:28:11

"I‚Äôm an antivaxer and there is no document you could write that would convince me vaccines are safe and effective beyond a reasonable doubt. There‚Äôs probably no way I could convince you of my arguments either. I think the problem is that we are both unwilling to be convinced of the other sides arguments because there is a lot of information out there(whether you would like to acknowledge it) to back up our positions.  From my point of view I look at the systems in the world being easily corrupted and this has been shown across industries and governments and businesses and humans in general. I don‚Äôt think the world is set up to benefit us and has our best interests at heart. They‚Äôre there to suit the agendas of whoever is to benefit the most. 

Secondly, I see all these other epidemics like autism, autoimmune diseases, neurological issues like Parkinson‚Äôs and dementia or anxiety and depression and no one offers any explanation as to why these things are happening at such a huge rate. I Look at autoimmune issues and then think what do humans do in life that could be a trigger or cause, then obviously vaccines could be a potential cause because your altering the natural immune response to things when you inject these scientifically proven toxic ingredients into the system. 
Or when you constantly hear stories of children after vaccinations becoming autistic or damaged in some way. 

Everyone has their own opinions of many different things in life but as crazy as pro-Vaxers think anti-vaxers are, I think pro Vaxers are just as crazy to at least not understand where we are coming from or be open to an alternative way of seeing this issue or life in general. 

Science and medical industry has been proven to be corrupted in the past. Scientific studies can be biased or skewed in a certain way. 

Grants are obviously not handed out to John‚Äôs Hopkins if they were to start a safety study or efficacy study on vaccines. They would lose millions in funding because it‚Äôs happened before. 

If your not following the agenda, and speak out you‚Äôre labeled crazy and thrown out of whatever establishment or industry you were in. It‚Äôs happened before. 

From my side, looking at your point of view, I do see vaccines having helped in the past but we live in a different world now with cleaner and more civilised ways of living. It‚Äôs stupid to compare what these vaccines did in the past because we can only assume what would have happened as our civilisation ‚Äògot cleaner‚Äô and more educated. 

Looking at modern medicine, take emergency out of the equation, most medication comes with a multitude of side effects using synthetic ingredients with no focus on health. It‚Äôs all about treating the symptom and not the cause. The pharmaceutical companies are running the show. 

This is part of the same system telling me that vaccines are safe and necessary and when I educate myself and choose not to buy into what a corrupt industry or system tells me, I‚Äôm supposed to be either crazy or dumb or selfish because I‚Äôm putting at risk the people that can‚Äôt be vaccinated. No offence but I don‚Äôt care to poison me or my family at the expense of others.

"Thanks for responding! I like to hear different perspectives. Firstly, I‚Äôd like to say you are wrong about me. I could 100% be convinced vaccines aren‚Äôt safe if I was shown sufficient evidence. I think that‚Äôs where we differ, my view CAN and WILL change with evidence presented to me. But as you say, nothing can change your mind. That sounds more religion-like to me, rather than a viewpoint informed by information. 

I agree that there are powerful and corrupt companies that do not always have me and you in their interest. No doubt about that. So, I work in a very large hospital system (in a lab), and we recently got an email about the logistics of distributing the vaccine once it is ready. As you may have heard, frontline workers will be the first to be able to get it. It‚Äôs assumed that pretty much 100% of frontline/medical workers will take the vaccine. They way I see it is, if the higher ups in medicine and science thought a vaccine wasn‚Äôt safe, why would they vaccinate every frontline and medical worker? All the hospitals and doctors offices and research labs would go out of business! There would be no one to care for the sick (not a good idea during an ongoing pandemic). 

Though I am generally a proponent of modern medicine, I DO think we are a country of unhealthy and over-medicated people. I agree that symptoms are treated instead of having adverse health conditions PREVENTED. I think more holistic approaches (diet, exercise, meditation, sleep, etc) should be used FIRST when possible. Big pharma is TERRIBLY corrupt there is no question about that. But I do personally believe that likely the safest thing you can take from big pharma is a vaccine. 

Things we eat in cheez doodles and Oreos every day (not saying you do or I do but the general public) and even just air pollution or micro plastics in water (things consumed every single day!!) are worse than anything we could get in some one time small dose injection that we KNOW will prevent a serious disease.

"It was enough to know that I would rather be educated by life and my own quest of knowledge through my interests and passions. I definitely didn't study either biology or chemistry in university as most people probably didn't but I think I have a healthy disposition for seeing through the bullshit that's being handed down and who its being handed down by is just as important.

My position on vaccines comes from;

People I know, who vaccinated their child and within a week or two, they became damaged.

I see the systems that are more interested in protecting their investments, the lobbying, the grants, the money, the greed, the power.

Healthcare/medical industry is a business, is it not? Like any other business its susceptible to corruption, lies and deceit just like all other industries. 

It relies on the science right to influence policy, make an informed decision and getting a product to market. 

Lets talk about the science that im sure is the backbone of your position. It has to be because we both know that we cant trust governments to make the best decisions for us. 

The problems with science......

\-Industry funded studies are four times more likely to be published than any other studies. 

\-Publication bias is massive problem in science and most scientists will tell you that. Organising a trial or study then if things go your way, it gets published and if not then no one knows about it. 

\-Take the psychiatric treatments people are using today. ""A[ **2015 study**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26159600) looked at 83 highly cited studies that claimed to feature effective psychiatric treatments. Only 16 had ever been successfully replicated. Another 16 were contradicted by follow-up attempts, and 11 were found to have substantially smaller effects the second time around. Meanwhile, nearly half of the studies (40) had never been subject to replication at all.""

I mean this is a common theme with studies and science. 

\-Peer reviewed  - A flawed process at the heart of science [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/)

Read that and tell me you can trust the science and results. Yeah science has done great things and the whole field isn't plagued with problems or corrupted, but you should at least see why people like me, who look at the good and the bad side, land on our conclusions. 

\-If you speak up or go against the establishment with legitimate concerns or finding, you're labelled a quack, or a looney, discredited and you'll lose your career. Look at the guys who worked in the CDC and published studies. Thompson. With his own hands he was editing the findings to suit the CDC's position on vaccines. 

I mean Cmon. Education has nothing to do with this. Look how much the media lies to suit their agendas. Yet the medical industry and science is clean and telling us the truth. 

The CDC hold 56 patents on vaccines. Vested interests. 

If you support science so much look at the science, examine the science on each ingredient added to a vaccine and what that does to the body and mind. 

We are the long term experiment right now. Where are the long term safety studies or efficacy studies on vaccines. 

It just doesn't make sense to inject a known neurotoxin like aluminium or mercury and not expect negative results. Yeah it might be small doses in one vaccine but combine the cumulative effect  of that neurotoxin and then tell me what the studies say, oh wait, those studies haven't been done. Mercury and aluminium might be ok in small doses but they have a synergistic effect that can be toxic or lethal. 

These things are in our environment sure, but they are not injected straight into our bodies and bloodstream bypassing our bodies natural filtration systems. 

I assume you've been educated so explain why autism rates are so high but don't use the argument the spectrum is wider and more testing is available these days. Thats industry jargon for sweeping it under the rug. Nut allergies, chrons, skin issues like eczema. Yeah It could be something else, a combination of things and vaccines COULD be the cause or could play a major part.

We'll never know because the science can be manipulated and the messengers are corrupt. 

I know I won't change your mind, all I hope is that you can understand where im coming from and respect how I feel and think this way.",jrap0a,2020-11-10 23:12:08
"No worries. I think both sides can be civil and just explain their point of view without the name calling and contempt.

I started to think about all things I wanted to say and evidence to back up at least my side as to why but I thought its going to take to long and I need to focus on other things I need to do for the day. 

I guess a quick summary would be that medicine and vaccines has a singular approach to sickness/illness and it might be potent to do what it says it will do but there are short and long term side effects to every drug ever created. 
The science and studies can be so easily manipulated depending on who is funding using publication bias and the fact that industry funded studies are 4 x more likely to be either cited or successful than non-funded studies. 

And could you imagine if a lab or university or hospital was ever allowed to study the effectiveness and safety of vaccines and it went against what the CDC, industries or governments have been telling us. 

You say ""big Pharma is corrupt""  so If someone lied to me about something, I wouldn't trust anything else that came out of their mouth yet you know big Pharma are dirty and corrupt to say the least, yet their telling the truth and being honest about vaccines. Thats not logical.

I get that vaccines have done good in the world but we live in a different environment now. Its cleaner, better sanitation, better hygiene but like most medicines that are based on nature, why is a vaccine the only way to heal and protect and there are more natural ways to stay healthy and deal with things like the chicken pox to reduce the severity and complications instead of making it out to be this deadly disease where vaccination is the only option.

Im already getting carried away but lastly you say ""one time small dose injection"" but its not is it. These days in Australia the standard doses for children up to age 15 is 49. 49 is not small and all these safety studies on vaccines is just for that particular vaccine not taking into account the other vaccines someone may or may not have. Its the dose that makes the poison!
Im in skincare and an ingredient phenoxyethanol above one percent(which is the safe limit per product) is classified as a skin irritant, endocrine disruptor, causing neurological disorders in infants etc. 

Thats in one product, now the average person uses 6-12 products a day so now you're absorbing 6%-12% daily of that ingredient phenoxyethanol which has been shown to be dangerous in studies yet not cumulative studies are done when used with other products containing the toxin. 

At least there is another couple of points to show legitimate concerns as to why I thin vaccinations are not as safe or effective as their made out to the and why I will choose to deal with my health and my families health in a more natural holistic way.",jrap0a,2020-11-10 05:05:01

"lol you still living in the 80s. nowadays we have quantum super computers that can speed up testing and simulations to study on long term effects. if covid happened in the 80s itd probably take 15 years for the vaccine to go on shelves and your argument would be valid. 

even if 0.001% are reactive, still beats the number of casualties by covid19. yea sucks to be those 0.001% but your risk of dying from covid19 would be much much higher. many world leaders are taking the vaccine earlier, those are the people that has most to lose and see their live more important than anyone else so you would think they arent gonna take such a risk if the reward isnt big enough.",jr2rj9,2020-11-18 18:16:51

"computer simulation speeds up things and help predict the outcome. it is very common in medical industries to use this approach to speed things up. no surprise given the priority and investment in covid19 vaccines we have had working trial vaccine within less than 3 months time.

and remember billions of people will be taking the shot, so there will be alot of vetting by 3rd parties and infividuals. better than being dead by covid19.",jr2rj9,2020-11-18 18:30:46

"I don‚Äôt know if you want a solution but here goes my best shot at one. Simply explain what a vaccine is, why it works, and how they make them. Herd immunity for children and adults who cannot take the vaccine (immunodeficiency I believe). Or, slowly adjust her to small scientific discoveries (preferably easier concepts to grasp e.g. why the car stops when applying the brakes). You could also compare vaccines to a practice test using an analogy that goes along the lines of you take a practice test to prepare for the test just as you would a vaccine before possible contraction of the common cold, shingles, and smallpox. You could also explain how different vaccines have different levels of effectiveness based on the accuracy of the prediction made (I am referring to the common cold here and the different variations each year that‚Äôs why there isn‚Äôt just one vaccine) I hope this helps, sometimes people don‚Äôt like things because they don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt understand what is going on and why it is happening. Also make sure she‚Äôs not being influenced by people that are not credible maybe explain why what‚Äôs wrong is wrong you could even ask your family doctor to explain vaccines to you all you have to do is call and then tell her what the doc said on the phone (she might not listen to a doctor but I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll most likely listen to you). Also try and explain the economy behind vaccines I don‚Äôt know too much about that but do some research and I dont mean cnn or abc news you can also call and ask your doctor to explain this and just like before explain it to her. I genuinely hope this helps you out at least a little.",jqcav1,2020-11-09 06:12:32

"I have a bad fear of needles too.  I find it helps if I don't see the needle go in, so I close my eyes.  Deep, steady breathing helps.

ask for the doctor to give no warning and to just jab it in. having a countdown only gets me worked up, so just feeling the sudden pinch is easier. and with the added distraction, i sometimes don‚Äôt even notice the doctor had delivered the shot.

one more idea: some vaccines and medicines will make your arm sore after. try and get your shots in your non-dominant arm. it makes the soreness much, much more tolerable.",jmwrgt,2020-11-03 01:38:49

"The vast majority of doctors have nothing but the best interests of their patients at heart, and I‚Äôve had a similar level of care given to my own son, though he didn‚Äôt have a reaction like yours did.

There‚Äôs a condition that runs in my family, which unfortunately is also in my partner‚Äôs. Since it‚Äôs fairly serious, we keep an eye on our son for any signs of it, and thankfully there have been none so far.

Before our toddler had his MMR vaccination, our doctor told us that he was aware of some preliminary research that suggested the vaccine combination might - MIGHT - make a child with his specific rare genetic predisposition more likely to end up with the disease, so we might want to delay by a few months while he waited for the research to be completed. He also arranged blood tests for our son to check he had no signs of the condition.

We delayed his MMR alone for a few months, and when the research ended up showing no correlation and my son‚Äôs blood tests came back showing he has the constitution of an ox, he had the shot. No problem, end of story!

Our doctor gave us reasonable information specific to our rather unusual circumstances, helped us make a decision based on the available scientific evidence, and supported us in it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",j9xkqb,2020-10-16 00:21:02

Outside of a specific allergy, there's NO condition that would lend itself to delaying the MMR for your child.

The predisposition (why the quotes, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?) is to a form of inflammatory bowel disease. It‚Äôs our family curse and there are many of us with it, as well as his father and some of his relatives having other forms of IBD.

My doctor never said there was a condition that necessitated delaying the vaccination. He said there had been preliminary research that MIGHT suggest a link. It worked out that the research didn‚Äôt show a link, so my son had the MMR along with all of the other vaccinations that were never in question, from his birth until the present day.

"No. Vaccines work by introducing either a weakened form of a disease or just a snippet of a diseases RNA/DNA so that the body can recognize and fight it, but the contagion is specifically modified so that it can not be spread from person to person.

The one caveat that I will add is smallpox necause the smallpox inoculation is administered dermally. You get pricked about half a dozen times so the virus is administered just below the skin. This causes a local outbreak that is contagious for several days. But, because the virus is cowpox and not actual smallpox, you only break out in that one localized spot, and even if you do spread it, its not particularly dangerous to a healthy person.",j7myuh,2020-10-08 23:57:14

"Amount of virus you are exposed to may affect the chance that you will be infected, so being around 2 people who have the flu is probably worse than 1

And the immune system takes time to respond to flu shots, so if they just had a flu shot that day, the shots has not started working yet, meaning that even though these people were vaccinated they still were as likely to have the flu as an unvaccinated person

If you are asking whether these people were contagious *because* they got the flu shot, no, they have the same risk of giving you the flu as an unvaccinated person, no more no less

Injected flu shots only contain dead viruses or parts thereof, and cannot infect anyone with flu (it might be possible that they temporarily weaken the immune system, leading the vaccinated person to catch some other virus), but there is no live flu virus at all in flu shots

There is live but weakened virus in the nasal spray flu vaccine, if someone is going to get the nasal vaccine they should probably ask the doctor about whether it is safe to be around immune compromised people after",j7myuh,2020-10-09 00:37:44

"Okay thank you. It does feel like something very weak I have, not saying that I‚Äôm going against what you‚Äôre saying but it makes sense why whatever I have isn‚Äôt as bad as the sicknesses I‚Äôve experienced 8 years ago. I haven‚Äôt gotten sick since then but at the same time I‚Äôve never co-inhabited with any individuals who have taken the Flu shot up until this year being my GF and newborn daughter which I can honestly say that we definitely are close and intimate and daughter obviously gets saliva on everything (contaminating me indefinitely). Just over thinking things to the point of a conspiracy that they got me sick LOL whatever, I‚Äôve been struggling to find out if it‚Äôs just a new adult onset of allergies that I‚Äôm not aware what it feels like since I‚Äôve never had them in my life or if it‚Äôs just the coronavirus (awaiting my test results from yesterday to see if it is) otherwise I just get waves of tiredness and a runny nose since September 25th the week the weather dropped to 45 at night and blew dead leaves and such throughout the whole time since and the same week they got both their shots together on the same day, but I feel way better on the days the sun makes it to at least a 70 degree day outside so I‚Äôm rooting for adult onset allergies and not the other two bad bugs I mentioned.

"Did you also get a flu shot? Getting the flu shot can make you feel a bit under the weather because your immune system responds to the vaccine (it needs to to make you immune to it). 

It sounds like allergies to me though! Or you're being affected by the drier weather. It's good that you got tested for coronavirus, that should settle that one for you. I'd say run it by your doctor, they may also recommend trying an over the counter allergy medicine.",j7myuh,2020-10-09 00:21:04

"You are seriously asking what is the function of a vaccine? 

Your immune system reacts to proteins called antigens, which are located on viruses, so it is not necessary to be exposed to virus itself to acquire immunity, but only to them.

Obviously, it is not so simple and not the case in all vaccines , but it is general idea behind flu vaccine",j7myuh,2020-10-09 07:14:44

"No flu shot for me. I was thinking dry air could be the culprit to my nose and the ‚Äúdry smell‚Äù I constantly smell in my sinuses. I will just have to wait for this covid test results I took at CVS which takes longer for results unfortunately. I never really remember getting this tired during summer to fall seasonal changes, only my throat adjusting to the air temperature from prior years which I had full knowledge of that bodily reaction but this stuff makes me tired this year unless allergies can make you tired then it‚Äôs plausible I have them with the other symptom described. Although the tiredness could just be the lack of sunlight since the season changed due the fact I feel way better the days it‚Äôs been rarely sunny so far.",j7myuh,2020-10-09 00:34:41

"If Covid test comes back negative I encourage you to get the flu shot once you feel 100% again. For your daughters sake. I‚Äôm in America and preparing for a flu season where everyone else has already used their sick days due to Covid, and school closes, Layoffs, ect. Babies (like yours) and the elderly are heavily impacted and could use every ounce of viral protection you can offer them. I‚Äôm in favor of protecting babies and the elderly so I ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù through a flu shot regularly for them, since my immune system is stronger. Honestly I feel like a bad ass after getting my shot, it‚Äôs a symbol of my commitment to health. I normally get a few after-shot symptoms but it‚Äôs normally just sniffles and body aches for a day or two. The nice part is knowing it‚Äôs just for a little while and once it‚Äôs over I will be stronger and those I love will be safer. 

I got the flu bad a few times the years I didn‚Äôt get a shot. At 20 years old was hospitalized for a strain of the flu. All I can say is thank goodness for tamiflu and medical care because I felt ready to die, I survived clearly, but the financial impact lasted years after. 

I like to think of myself as a viral shield for the people who are vulnerable to illness whom I love. And after a sever run in with the flu (even though I was young and healthy) I like the protection for myself too. 

Get your flu shot",j7myuh,2020-10-09 04:59:25
"Also should say Dry Air maybe the culprit, I live in Mid-west USA and the wildfires this year have been so bad I have been running my humidifier daily for relief from the smoky-death-air",j7myuh,2020-10-09 05:03:07
"Although this is two weeks old I‚Äôd like to say that what makes covid dangerous is how easily it spreads and the fact that symptoms aren‚Äôt consistent, it might seem like the cold to one guy and then kill the next in a week.

My grandfather was on ventilator for 32 days but my grandmother was just experiencing flu-like symptoms for a week.",j7myuh,2020-10-22 00:38:47
"There is no herd immunity from flu, and it will probably never be due to mutability of virus and multiple natural reservoirs.

However, by vaccinating we lower the spread In community and protect the vulnerable.

You can still get flu even if vaccinated, but it will last shorter and symptoms won't be as severe.",j7myuh,2020-10-09 07:58:27
"Hey I think it is great that you are asking questions, and I'm really glad that you landed here in a pro-vax sub that is going to give you some helpful information. There is nothing wrong with asking questions :) you just always have to be careful about who you're asking. 

I studied microbiology, and the flu shot is just inactivated pieces of the virus, so no worries about getting sick if multiple household members get the flu shot in one day. They won't be contagious because they don't have any live virus from the flu shot. 

It is highly highly recommended to get the flu shot this year because so many flu symptoms are so similar to covid, so definitely talk with your doctor to figure out if it is right for you and your family and keep yourselves safe. 

Have a great evening!",j7myuh,2020-10-09 00:11:00

There's also a large pdf called ""The Truth Will Prevail"" with 1200 studies used to support anti-vax positions. A simple Google search will be able to find it.

‚ÄúThe traditional approach in cancer research was primarily focused on the identification and determining the general patterns of genetic anomalies that result from the mutational or other chromosomal aberration events.

The answer for most should be obvious, especially when things are more obscured because they‚Äôre not juxtaposed against one another like in my comment here (or perhaps not often).

As for the question on the comments you could point out that vaccines have been recalled before. If nobody cared for your safety why recall something over side affects? It could only mean that an entire division of the government is dedicated to ensuring these things are safe.

As for the question in the post there is really no good answer. If you deny science there is nothing that can disprove you. But you could try pointing out that science 70 years ago is nowhere near as good as it is today and how fast humans progress.

You should talk to your physician about it, especially if you plan being around babies.

Additionally, flu vaccine cannot make you sick as In give you flu, although some people have a bit stronger immune reaction, but it usually lasts a day or two, which beats two weeks of miserable time with flu.

I am hesitant to get something that caused me to end up in the ER with breathing issues for reasons no one understands, even if it is a safer version. My doctor says it should be OK but understands my concerns and does not try to pressure me to take it. The Tdap is also not that effective, so it is likely that I could still spread pertussis to someone even if I was vaccinated

As for the flu shot, I pretty much never get the flu and I have talked to my doctor, who doesn't see much need for me to get a flu shot given that I don't have risk factors for severe flu

I am aware that the illness that follows flu shots is not influenza infection, but it isn't always just 2 days, my doctor says it can last 2-3 weeks, and I've know people who were sick for 1 week after  flu shots",j58lvy,2020-10-05 21:32:18
">You should talk to your physician about it, especially if you plan being around babies.

Are you serious? Do you not know that the acellular Pertussis vaccine doesn't keep you from spreading it? It simply gives you milder symptoms, and increases your likelihood of spreading it precisely because you may not realize you have it due to milder symptoms.

"Okay, so if you want to go off technicalities, by your reasoning we should refer to everything this way. No food is 100% safe to eat. No pet is 100% safe to own. No car is 100% safe to drive. No bed is 100% safe to sleep in. By this reasoning we should never do anything or go anywhere because it's never 100% guaranteed to be safe. 

I realize there are things that are going to cause me harm and I take my precautions against them. But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop eating food or be terrified my cat is going to eat me.

"You're totally correct. And what's more the companies involved have successfully lobbied to have bills passed that indemnify then from harm caused through vaccines. So they can't be sued if their product causes injury or death.  

This is the same industry with the highest CRIMINAL fines and law suit payouts in history for their damaging products. That again CRIMINAL fines. That means they broke the law and on doing so harmed or killed enough people to get the biggest criminal fine in history. Hmmm would i trust the bigest criminal in history to make something safe who can't by law be punished if it through negligence it  harms me?

"Your claim numbers look correct but the companies making the vaccines don't pay and are usually not allowed tio be sued. See below and recheck your facts. I don't think my statement was a falsehood:

For most drugs‚Äîactually, every type of drug other than vaccines‚Äîthe manufacturer can be legally liable for harm that results from a product it sells. Vaccines are produced by privately held pharmaceutical companies, but they have a unique arrangement with the U.S. government: When a person reports harm that could feasibly be related to a vaccine, a government program‚Äînot a pharmaceutical company‚Äîpays compensation.

Also:
Normally, patients who experience a vaccine injury are barred from using the judicial system, and can seek compensation for their alleged injuries under the¬†(NVICP),

Also there been tipped to ne a steroidal arrangement for Covid vax. 

recent¬†declaration¬†by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar preemptively slots prospective claims alleging injury from COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, diagnostics, and ‚Äúother related countermeasures‚Äù under a federal program called the¬†Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program¬†(CICP).

The program widens manufacturers‚Äô liability protections already in place for certain vaccines known to cause injury, and shifts a majority of personal injury lawsuits out of the judicial system and into an administrative body.

"Sure, and now imagine a world where we treat citizens as adults and tell them the truth.  Of course we should sell peanut butter, just as we should sell vaccines.  Think about what I‚Äôm suggesting.",j2zuy3,2020-10-02 02:09:45
"This is a direct quote from justice.gov:

""The VICP is designed to encourage vaccination by providing a streamlined system for compensation in rare instances where an injury results from vaccination.¬† Over the past 30 years, the VICP has succeeded in providing a less adversarial, less expensive, and less time-consuming system of recovery than the traditional tort system that governs medical malpractice, personal injury, and product liability cases.¬† More than 6,000 people have been paid in excess of $3.9 billion (combined) since the Program‚Äôs 1988 inception.

Individuals who believe they have been injured by a covered vaccine can file a claim against the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking compensation from the Vaccine Trust Fund. Civil Division, Torts Branch attorneys in the Office of Vaccine Litigation defend HHS against claims filed under the VICP, and ensure that fair compensation is awarded in every case meeting the eligibility criteria.""

Just because you can't directly sue a company doesn't mean it's unfair. The whole reason they made the system this way is because vaccines are so important, that they want there to be as few reasons as possible for people not to get them. This system makes it so easy to be compensated for an injury that there's really no risk you won't be paid if something does happen. Suing companies is expensive, takes years and is a long arduous process, and after all that you still might not win against a company with an army of highly paid lawyers. This is a much better system for the patient, and makes sure you have the best chance of being paid should something happen.",j2zuy3,2020-10-02 03:59:17
"We... Do? You have access to the number of injuries vs number of vaccines just as I do. You're asked if you have any allergies before you get the vaccine and they can make adjustments if you do. You are given a sheet of paper at the doctor called a VIS that you can also get from the CDC website that informs you of what the risks may be, and how to file for compensation IF anything occurs. Your doctor or pharmacist will answer any questions regarding the vaccine you may have. There are links and numbers you can get in touch with if you have more questions. The truth is all available and readily accessed, you just have to act like an adult and find it.",j2zuy3,2020-10-02 03:43:56

"It's not really my standpoint. It's just what it is. There's not really a huge government conspiracy behind vaccines. The truth is vaccines are probably one of the safest forms of medical treatment you can receive. They're probably safer than a lot of medicine, painkillers, and other forms of medical treatment (which already have a ton of care taken into researching and creating). Lots of care goes into making them safe, and it's why we still don't have a Covid vaccine. And resources to be compensated if something were to happen are some of the easiest to obtain in the US.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of people who would rather believe there's a grand scheme behind it than to believe they're there to keep you and others from spreading pathogens. And sure, while I'd agree with you and say that the US government's medical system is shot and it's always good to be wary of things, vaccines are a worldwide thing. If no government and no medical research team in the world has stood up and said that vaccines do more harm than good, then it's safe to say you're better off getting vaccinated. Because they have a lot more resources and a lot more funding to research than your middle aged stay at home mom on Facebook.",j2zuy3,2020-10-03 14:57:37
"There's a link to hrsa.gov that has a file listing the injury rate for each vaccine and the number of compensations provided, as well as links and numbers to contact should you have questions or need more information. You can find all that information should you wonder it. 

Vaccines are extremely safe and are effective. There is nothing in this world that is ""totally safe and effective"" in the way you want. Everything has dangers in it. Ibuprofen sometimes doesn't cure your headache, and even it could kill you one day. Doesn't mean you should refuse to take it if you really need it. 

 I don't think you understand how many diseases we don't suffer from anymore because of vaccines. Diseases that are almost as old as human history. Diseases that ruined humanity and could do it again. Vaccines protect yourself, but they also reduce the rate it gets passed to other people. And 50% less disease related injuries and deaths is a lot better than 100% deaths and injuries.",j2zuy3,2020-10-02 04:14:08

The system is sensitive enough that it can pick up on years when the flu vaccine causes more headaches and fevers, and it sniffs out when a bad batch of vaccine slips through the quality control process (which isn't often!), and normally can trace it down to the single batch or narrow it down to within a window of a few batch that need pulled. These systems are in place to check and double check back on through all of the data available.

I'm honestly curious where you got this ""information""",j2yirj,2020-10-01 02:58:48
"Do you actually know what they put in the vaccine? Such as formaldehyde, thiomersal etc. Vaccines may work in the short term, but compromise your future health. Storing up dementia and cancer in years to come. The flu vaccine has been shown to contain neurotoxins. If you don't mind that kind of shit being injected into your body, then crack on. But allow us to make our choice. I don't wish to be dealing with the problems it may give me as I get older. To each his own.

"flu shots (at least i think) don't contain neurotoxins. also in my home state (VA) single-use shot vials are used, and those do not contain thiomersal. also, all the chemicals you just mentioned are in minute amounts, and shouldn't be harmful.  plus, your body is bound to be a little under the weather since your immune system trains itself against the myriad of contagious flu specimens coming our way. also saying vaccines are causing cancer is kinda contradictory since the hpv vaccine was designed to stop you from getting hpv-related cancer",j2yirj,2020-10-13 20:06:29

I believe an unvaccinated person is a threat to those that are unable to receive vaccines due to existing health conditions.,j28yci,2020-09-30 15:24:07
"vaccines dont prevent you from becoming infected, they just lessen the extent of the infection, perhaps sometimes to undetectable levels where ya dont even know you got it. that can also happen without being vaccinated.

 regardless if vaccinated or not, either one may become infected most likely at similar rates.  theoretically, this should come across as ""u wanna have a better time if and when you catch the virus? get vaccinated. you wanna get hit full force? dont."".  the bigger issue here is people not staying in their homes when they are sick and spreading whatever they got. vaccinated folks do this just like unvaccinated, they just dont have as big a window to spread it.   only real difference between vaxxed and not vaxxed.  i give zero fucks about hanging around either vaccinated or nonvaccinated people. either can spread shit to me and it is and should be my choice to determine if i want to risk getting really sick or to pony up and pay for something ill likely not ever encounter or have serious complications from due to being reasonably healthy. it is up to both the sick vaxxer and sick antivaxxer to make people aware they are currently a vector and stay isolated for the required duration.

theres really no reason for all this division and hate.  yall all need to remove the shaming and hate and start trying healthy communication. 

im not an antivaxxer or pro, i hover somewhere inbetween and i support both lifestyle choices.",j28yci,2020-10-02 07:44:40

"> vaccines dont prevent you from becoming infected, they just lessen the extent of the infection, perhaps sometimes to undetectable levels where ya dont even know you got it. that can also happen without being vaccinated.

This is only partially correct. An [infection ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection#:~:text=An%20infection%20is%20the%20invasion,and%20the%20toxins%20they%20produce.)is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to the infectious agents and the toxins they produce. This is prevented by vaccines, as they prime the immune system to be able to respond quickly and with a strong immune response to destroy the pathogen. What vaccines do not prevent is exposure to a pathogen. When a vaccinated person is exposed to a pathogen, the lack of symptoms that they experience is because the pathogen has been destroyed, not because the symptoms are just absent.

As for your second paragraph, people are EXPOSED at similar rates, yes. By and large, vaccinated people will be less likely to get infected than non-vaccinated people. Further, Non-vaccinated people, once infected, provide ample opportunity for a pathogen to mutate or evolve. The more people get infected, the more likely it is that the pathogen will mutate and change. If the pathogen changes enough, the vaccine can become completely useless. Already, you can see that the choices an anti-vaxxer makes will undermine the choices made by a vaccinated person.

Also in your second paragraph, you state that you don't care whether someone is an anti-vaxxer or not, since YOU can have some measure of control over the severity of your infection by vaccinating or not. This statement is problematic for two reasons.

1) This isn't entirely correct, as we saw in the previous paragraph, the more the pathogen mutates, the more likely it is that their choice NOT to vaccinate will undermine your choice to vaccinate.

2) Not everyone has this choice that you have. The privilege of good health that allows you to choose to get vaccinated isn't extended to everyone in the world. Lots of people, including cancer patients, the otherwise immunocompromised, the elderly, CAN'T get vaccinated, and will suffer more severely. When a high enough proportion of people are vaccinated, these groups are protected by virtue of herd immunity. If enough people choose not to vaccinate, these groups of people become susceptible.

""Division and Hate"" is a result of the frustration surrounding anti-vaxxers blatant disregard for the health of others, and for science itself. It is a callous, inhumane, self-absorbed movement that values personal comfort over public health, and as such, deserves the shaming that it gets.

It's nice that you can sit on the fence, but the truth is that anti-vaxxers inevitably lead to death that could otherwise be avoided. As such, I will never, ever support them.",j28yci,2020-10-02 14:36:30
"I personally don't take flu shots because I tend not to get sick and many people I know say flu shots make them sick

The covid situation doesn't change my attitude toward flu shots much, on one hand it is good not to get the flu when there is another more serious virus going around, but on the other there is some speculative research that IIRC says flu shots might increase susceptibility to certain non- influenza viruses, I'm not sure how reliable this research is, but given that I don't get the flu much anyway, I don't really feel a need to get a vaccine that might make me sick",j2u97z,2020-09-30 22:33:40

PART 1: How Bill Gates Monopolized Global Health

* Late 90's Microsoft was taken to court by the US for illegally maintaining its monopoly by not allowing users to download other programs.(United States v. Microsoft Corp.) The district court ruled that Microsoft's actions constituted unlawful monopolization under Section 2 of the [Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act_of_1890).
* Helped reshape his image and push his agenda by creating the private foundation Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and spending tens of millions on Media Partnerships. Funding:

1. The Guardian Global Development Website
2. NPR Global Health Coverage
3. Our World in Data website
4. BBC Health and Development issues
5. ABC World health coverage
6. NewsHour Communications Cheif Rob Flynn when asked about Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation conflict of interest after donating $3.5 million to his station: ‚ÄúIn some regards I guess you might say that there are not a heck of a lot of things you could touch in global health these days that would not have some kind of Gates tentacle.‚Äù

* Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Sponsored these health institutions (to name just a few) adding up to billions of dollars in commitments:

1. **GAVI: The Vaccine Alliance** $750,000,000 Seed Money and Profit $4.1 Billion in commitments.
2. Donated undisclosed seed money to **The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.**
3. **Global Financing Facility** contributed founding partner $275,000,000.
4. **CEPI: New Vaccines for a safer world** initial investment $100,000,000.
5. **Global COVID-19 Response** $250,000,000. Every aspect of *Coronavirus pandemic* Bill Gates has some tie to organizations, foundations, and individuals with direct funding.
6. WHO recent donor report shows Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the 2nd largest donor behind US. Donating more than Australia, UK, Germany, France, Russia, and Canada combined.

* Gates involvement of overblown projections of COVID-19

\- This year alone (2020) donating $79 million+ to **Imperial College COVID-19 Research Team** predicted 510,000 deaths in UK and 2.2 million in the US unless strict gvmt. measures were put in place.

\- 10 year $279 million investment to **Institue for Health Metrics and Evaluation** used in corroboration with White House to justify lockdowns.

* Gates ties to **Anthony Fauci, Director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID)**: 2010 Appointed to Leadership Council of the Gates founded **""Decade of Vaccine"" project to implement Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP)**. Gates committed $10 Billion.
* October 2019 (right before covid pandemic) Gates contributed $100,000,000 to National Institute of Health (NIH, parent Institution of NIAID) to develop Gene Based HIV treatment. Assisting Fauci's research into HIV.
* October 2019 (right before covid pandemic) Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation partner with the World Economic Forum and John Hopkins Center for Health Security to stage **Event 201, a tabletop exercise to gauge the economic and societal impact of a** ***globally-spreading coronavirus pandemic.*** You have to look this up, it's an INCREDIBLE COINCIDENCE.

\*\*\*Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is not a selfless and solely charitable endeavor. It maintains a dual-structure. **The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust** manages endowment assets. Grants given by the foundation, often benefit the value of the trust's assets.

Gates is always touted as donating vast amounts of his wealth, yet since the beginning of the **""Decade of Vaccine"" project** his net worth has nearly doubled from **$54 Billion to $104.1 Billion.**

The Rockefeller family is a direct mirror of the Tycoon turned Philanthropist story. When faced with public backlash, Gates, like David Rockefeller, helped create private foundations connected with his own business interest.

Vit C, D3 and Zinc are impossible to be found, yet there is no problem finding pharma SSRI's, Opioids, Benzodiazepine's, Alcohol, Cigarettes and diabetes medication for those locked in their homes - not being allowed to grow their own vegetables, go out into sunlight and speak with their neighbors or refinish their basements for their family/friends losing their jobs. - the odds of testing positive is higher than being inflicted with covid itself... - the patent for the virus vaccine was in the basement of building 7 along side Clinton's email server and Epstein's beta tapes.. - the virus only affects the psyche of those whom apply power to a television and base life's decisions on breaking new information written on rolled up dead trees.. - also, be careful not to spread fake news or dangerous misinformation online about this virus... make sure you leave that to the professionals over at CBC, CTV, Global and the rest of the reliable mainstream media journalists around the world.¬†¬†",ixkfei,2020-09-23 03:23:44

just like cellular tissue that divides rapidly is in more danger from radiation than older cells that dont divide often.

the amount might add up to a worrisome amount. amounts and timing are very important. you are also bypassing the digestive tract with injection, so much of your bodys natural mechanisms to break down toxins is bypassed in this equation.

i wouldnt say ""REEEE VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM"" but i would certainly suggest that they could certainly be part of the problem, along with artificial food ingredients, poor nutrition, exposure to chemicals all over (pesticides in food etc)

"Unfortunately there is plenty of science calling the safety of these products into question. However there is a 60 billion dollar per year industry pushing a narrative that vaccines are unequivocally safe. That is not true. Billions have been paid to compensate for adverse vaccine reactions including brain damage. According to HHS only 1 percent of vaccine reactions are reported.

https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf

Science does not support the proposition that these products are 100% necessary and safe, but in fact suggests they are the root of the epidemic of autism and auto immune disease we face in the US. Take a look at HBV.

Recent studies from a top Chinese university have shown a potential link between HBV vaccine given after birth and autism/neurological impairment. These are the first studies of their kind. This 2016 mice study shows significant neurological effects from just one round of the hep b vaccine:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/

This well sourced paper explains the importance of animal studies in analyzing vaccine toxicity:

http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Animal-Studies.pdf

The 2016 mice study speaks for itself:

‚ÄúThis work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and multiple sclerosis.‚Äù

This is testing ONE vaccine. Not the cumulative effect of the combined aluminum injected into children under the ever increasing modern vaccine schedule. A 2018 follow up study on the mechanics of this process found the following:

‚ÄúThese findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.‚Äù

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29751176/

Paul Patterson's research at Caltech supports the proposition that a vaccine induced immune activation event could lead to autism and other neurological dysfunction.

http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4166/

Hep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial that would uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it to every child born in America on the first day of life. However the vaccine has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles) until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.

https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/1/8/16863656/childhood-mortality-united-states

HBV is one vaccine we should probably take off the schedule. Not everyone asking for safer vaccines is ignorant or scientifically illiterate.

8) A recent UK study shows elevated aluminum levels in autistic brains, apparently from aluminum adjuvant transported there by the immune system. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763

Phamacuitical products should be thoroughly tested before  human consumption. Considering there is no compelling reason to vaccinate newborns for Hep B, if the mother is negative, we should probably pull it from the schedule at least until more animal studies give us additional insight into the role of aluminum nanoparticles in triggering an immune response/cytokines in the brain, leading to possible neurological damage.",iva0su,2020-09-19 03:11:02

For the Infanrix brand: ""Each 0.5-mL dose contains aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant (not more than 0.625 mg aluminum by assay) and 4.5 mg of sodium chloride. Each dose also contains ‚â§100 ¬µg of residual formaldehyde and ‚â§100 ¬µg of polysorbate 80 (Tween 80).""",iva0su,2020-09-27 16:28:24

Lower respiratory disease..because they don‚Äôt have basic healthcare.

https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death

My main point is, yes vaccines have been helpful to eradicate disease (with a catch), but to say it is solely responsible is untrue and I think we can agree on that.

"Firstly thank you giving your time and energy to discuss this with me. I will share with you the sources I've read.

Secondly the number you've shared about measles deaths are pre-vaccine era. Sorry, I should've been more clear in that chance of death is 0% in the last decade or so. You'd be hard pressed to find a measles death in the US in the last 20 years I think. Yes I agree that is in part because of the vaccine, BUT people are surviving also because we have access to clean water, good food, and medicine. People dying from measles are malnourished and/or do not have adequate sanitation. Like in impoverished populations. But I digress..  

Here is a Meta-Analysis study concluding inadequate data:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22336803/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22336803/)

""We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine.""

""The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.""

Here's a link the CDC's vaccine safety studies on MMR. If you read each study, I think you'd agree that the studies have relatively small sample sizes. And fail to give me the confidence one would need when vaccinating an entire country/population of children:

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr/mmr-studies.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr/mmr-studies.html)

Also like you asked here's an article in a peer reviewed journal explaining the underreporting in VEARS. And over-reporting case fatality rates of measles.

This was posted in the British Medical Journal:

[https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5104/rr-13](https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5104/rr-13)

""In the late 1950s and early 1960s, right before the measles mass vaccination program was introduced, the chance of dying from measles was 1 in 10,000 or 0.01%.\[3\] However, the public is generally unaware of this figure as the CDC publishes case-fatality rates based on the number of reported cases only. Since it is estimated that nearly 90% of measles cases are benign and therefore not reported to the CDC, the widely publicized measles case-fatality rate is 10 times higher than what is actually found in the general population.""

""A query of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for symptoms involving seizures and convulsions from all measles vaccines (for U.S. children age 6 months to 2 years, between 2011 and 2015) results in about 90 seizure reports per year.\[8\] This is only 1.6% of the about 5,700 expected MMR-related seizures based on Vestergaard‚Äôs findings. Other serious vaccine adverse events after MMR, including deaths, may similarly be underreported.""

So these are my sources, which I would like to think extremely reliable. Could you please provide a source about over-reporting to VEARS? 

To conclude, I am only trying to find hard evidence that MMR is safer than facing the risk of catching and dying/having complications from measles itself. Before replying, please go through the CDC safety studies and read for yourself. And if I'm missing something, or am not correctly interpreting these studies correctly please call me out.

Anyways, the link you provided is to Immunize Act Coalition with stories about people who weren‚Äôt vaccinated. (No scientific studies) I checked Mumps and Rubella, only 3 stories with no deaths, and rare complications (not much to work with there)
As for Measles, 13 stories (some aren‚Äôt stories at all, they are articles written by IAC.) It‚Äôs unfortunate encephalitis can occur and as rare as it is, can be deadly. But these are not very helpful in my continuous search for reliable and useful references/studies to give the confidence I need.
By the way, no vaccine is completely safe, and you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find that as a fact. But most vaccines have a risk/reward that is in favor of vaccination. Because the risk of infection and death/complications is worse than the vaccine itself.",iva0su,2020-09-21 05:58:38

"Yes. There have been recent measles outbreaks in several communities in the US in the last few years. Because of anti-vaxxer propaganda.

Even if your daughter isn‚Äôt immunocompromised and would be fine if she caught it, so you really want the blood of some other kid who *is* immunocompromised on your hands? Also. If your kid ever wants to work in healthcare she will have to get the MMR vaccine, and there are lots of positions with similar requirements. Most people only need it once to have immunity for life. Why wouldn‚Äôt you want that for your kid? 

For your daughter‚Äôs sake and for public health, vaccination is necessary.

I think you've been misinformed about the death rates in the pre-vaccine era. If you look closely at the graph I provided, you can see most diseases we have vaccinated for was already dropping rapidly or already less than 1% death rate.

This statement is extremely misleading and takes away from the fact that our overall health care and access to clean water/better nutrition is just as important if not more important than vaccinating.

Anyways I do see your point, it‚Äôs not fair that kids are immunocompromised and cannot receive beneficial vaccines. It‚Äôs really unfortunate and we need to do everything we can to keep those people safe. Which includes quarantine, washing hands, good nutrition and sleep, and everything else that has to do with staying as healthy as possible to increase our chances to beating any and all disease. 

With that being said, I‚Äôve done research into both points of view, completely vaccinating according to CDC schedule and not vaccinating at all. That‚Äôs why my daughter is vaccinated for pneumococcal (Prevnar 13), Hib, and Dtap. But I‚Äôm having trouble accepting the MMR vaccine as a reward in my daughters favor. And yes It would be heartbreaking knowing my unvaccinated daughter contributed to the suffering of another person. That‚Äôs why i think its important to take part in the above precautions.
Here is some research I dug up that gives me the reason to question the MMR safety. From what I‚Äôve found, there is not enough evidence and too much counter evidence to support a safe enough vaccine to give to my daughter.

https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death-rate

Measles deaths were already dropping to near zero before the vaccine. And we can thank clean water, sanitation, better food, and antibiotics for that. Yes the vaccine helped lower that even more in the late 60s, but to say the vaccine is primarily responsible is not consistent with the data.

"Thanks for sharing, I wasn't really asking about the covid vaccine since it hasn't been approved yet, but don't mind sharing my thoughts as well.

First off, a vaccine is not a cure. There is no cure for viruses. Vaccines can help defend against viruses most of the time, but not all of the time, I think the fu vaccine is a prime example.

Secondly covid is nowhere near one of the modern worlds deadliest viruses. I think the CDC said that only 6% of all deaths from covid were from *only* covid. And deaths under 20 years old are almost non existent. I'm not downplaying the deaths, but I think it's important we understand that it's not as deadly as we originally thought. We do need to be cautious, but no need to be afraid for your life. If you catch the flu it sucks, but your not afraid for your life are you? Maybe if your obese and have heart problems be careful and keep distance from people, but still your chances of dying are incredibly low.

">But if we compare that to the actual death rate we will see something different. The measles vaccine is not in any way correlated with measles deaths.

Now I'm confused, because my graph was the death rate, and the graph you linked does not disagree with mine, the scale is just different because they are trying to fit cases and deaths on the same graph, if you mouse over the points for the death graph you will see that in the late 50s and early 60s the death rate was around 0.2-0.3, but it dropped to 0.01 in the 1960s when the vaccine came out, which is the same thing my graph shows

It is true that improvements in living conditions lowered the death numbers from 1925-1950, but there was little decline after 1950, until the vaccine nearly eliminated measles starting in the 60s

No one said the decline from 1925-1950 was due to the vaccine, all I am saying is that the early declining trends did not continue past the early 50s, and most of the decline *since then* was due to the vaccine",iva0su,2020-09-22 00:31:03

The tobacco industry literally made scientific studies saying cigarettes were good for you. You could buy a cig from a nurse, they would wheel a cart for you to choose your favorite brand next your hospital bed.. 
Coca Cola has paid off scientists to skew data to make sugar not look as bad for our health. I digress..

So as long as there are conflicts of interest, which CDC does have, I will be continuing to question everything and everyone. 


Here is some research I dug up that gives me the reason to question the MMR safety. From what I‚Äôve found, there is not enough evidence and too much counter evidence to support a safe enough vaccine to give to my daughter. If you don‚Äôt wish to go through the studies I‚Äôve provided or discuss this any further, I understand and thanks for your time. 

Here is a Meta-Analysis Study
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235361/

Authors' conclusions: The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with MMR cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.


British Medical Journal
https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5104/rr-13

A query of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for symptoms involving seizures and convulsions from all measles vaccines (for U.S. children age 6 months to 2 years, between 2011 and 2015) results in about 90 seizure reports per year.[8] This is only 1.6% of the about 5,700 expected MMR-related seizures based on Vestergaard‚Äôs findings.

You're forgetting these diseases have (on average) an incubation period of two weeks, meaning people are disease vectors without showing many symptoms yet. People tried that quarantine 'solution' before vaccines existed, millions died, every year.  
And, contrary to popular antivaxxer myths, these diseases are [not harmless](https://i.imgur.com/jbozo99.jpg).

Besides the well known complications, there's also SSPE
> A deadly complication of the measles, which can occur years after a person is infected with the virus, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), is a progressive neurological disorder that involves inflammation in the brain. *People with SSPE die*, on average, within one or two years of being diagnosed with the disease.

> one in 609 , before age 1

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-measles-complication-more-common-than-doctors-thought/  

and then there's measles induced immune amnesia to consider  

> Our results show that when measles was common, *MV infections could have been implicated in as many as half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease*, thus accounting for nearly all of the interannual fluctuations in childhood infectious disease deaths. *The reduction of MV infections was the main factor in reducing overall childhood infectious disease mortality after the introduction of vaccination.*

">I have a hypothetical question for you. Do you think, if we were still in a malnourished and unsanitary world, without access to clean water, basically pre 1900s.. do you think the death rate with access to MMR, would still be below 1%?

I'm not sure why you are referring to 1%? 1% of the population dying every year would be worse than the 1918 flu every single year, measles has never been that bad

The 1 on the graph scale is 1 in 100,000 deaths per year, or a thousandth of a percent

I'm going to assume you meant to say under 1 on the graph, which would mean less than 1 in 100,000 deaths per year 

I do think the death rate per year would be less than 1 in 100,000 if we went back to early 1900s or even 1800s conditions but still vaccinated everyone

Here is why I think this:

The vaccine is around 95% effective, so it should result in a 95% decrease in measles even without taking heard immunity into account. Since certain percentage of people with measles die, a 95% decrease in cases would mean a 95% decrease in deaths

My graph doesn't go back to the 1800s, but it shows an average of 5-6 measles deaths per 100K people per year in the 1920s. so if the death rate dropped by 95%, it would be around 0.25

Even if we estimate high and assume a death rate of 10, a 95% decrease still gets it down to 0.5

This is all based on the assumption that in the old days we still had a good enough immune system to develop long term immunity when vaccinated

I feel reasonably comfortably making this assumption, because long term immunity to viruses such as smallpox and cowpox was documented as early as the 1700s, and there are even references to only getting measles once from ancient Egypt in BC times",iva0su,2020-09-22 15:09:33

"I think our definitions of research are different. By definition it is to investigate systematically. Which in my opinion I have tried to do to the best of my ability. I am trying my best to look at this topic objectively without bias. That is why I have vaccinated my daughter with Prevnar, Hib, and Dtap because of their effectiveness and risk/reward in favor of the vaccine. I am in no way ""anti-vaxx"". If I were selfish and bias, I would have not done any personal research. I think it's incredibly important that we ask questions about what we're putting into our bodies, even to the most qualified authorities.  I do have a full-time job and I'm raising an infant daughter, and I do not have the time (and don't think any parent has the time) to ""compile literature reviews"" and ""perform independent probability statistics"". I think that is a little unnecessary. But what I have done with the little time I do take to unsure my family's health, is to look up each source and thoroughly read each reference. And my conclusions (based on the CDC website of vaccine safety on MMR) is that MMR does not give me the confidence that it is entirely safe based on the risk/reward of the measles virus itself.

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr/mmr-studies.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr/mmr-studies.html)

Also, I am in no way ""dismissing"" the statements of ""valid authorities"" and scientific consensus. This Meta-Analysis study is by definition from our ""valid authorities"". Please let me know if this not a reliable source.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235361/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235361/)

The measles virus is so rare and death and complications even more rare compared to the ""unknowns"" of the vaccine adverse effects, I'm still leaning towards not vaccinating, but stay open to the option if needed. 

Yes measles can be harmful, but so can the vaccine. Both are rare occurrences, it's just a matter of the risk for each decision. 

After talking about confirmation bias, I think it is a little ironic that your sources for information are ""[scientificamerican.com](https://scientificamerican.com)"" ""[sciencemag.org](https://sciencemag.org)"" and ""[vaxopedia.org](https://vaxopedia.org)"". 

I have looked into your sources and still do not have the confidence that MMR is safer than in the rare occurrence my daughter actually catching the measles virus. Yes, it is unfortunate that some kids cannot take the vaccine, and it would break my heart knowing my daughter could potentially cause suffering onto others by contracting a virus, but this could be said for any virus including the common cold, flu, strep throat, or any other harmful infectious disease. On top of that I'm doing everything in my power to insure her health when it comes to adequate sleep, nutrition and hydration, and exercise which all prove to boost immunity to any and all disease.

My personal research has vastly improved my life and my family's life. I am in no way dismissing the knowledge and education of our healthcare professionals, their knowledge and expertise is essential to our well being. But what I've learned about overall health, nutrition, exercise, meditation, and stress management, was not from my primary health care provider.

"According to someone directly involved with the vaccine trials;  

---
*Safety is the top concern in all vaccine trials, and we go to great lengths to ensure the vaccine is safe to use, and to keep our trial participants safe*

*Here are some of the ways we do that*  

*First we have a dedicated phone number our participants can phone 24hrs a day, 365 days a year with ANY medical concerns that gets them straight to a study doctor*

*We provide advice, direct them to appropriate care, and record ALL symptoms/events in our participants*  

*All participants have symptom diaries they complete in the period following vaccination*

*We receive alerts if any serious symptoms are recorded so we can follow up with them, check they're OK, and review if they were related to the vaccine (some mild side effects are normal)*  

*We conduct frequent face to face reviews with the participants to check their diaries and ask them about anything they may have forgotten to tell us about*

*If they took paracetamol for a headache, it gets recorded*

*Antihistamine for sneezing, gets recorded*

*Everything*  

*What if something serious happens?*

*If a patient is hospitalised FOR ANY REASON (fell down the stairs, anaphylaxis to a bee, hernia repair etc) we review ALL the details of the admission and speak directly to the study sponsor within 24hrs*  

*Some stuff is totally obviously unrelated (e.g. car accident)*

*For other stuff, we speak to the medical specialists looking after the patient and the study sponsor to discuss any possibility it could be related to the vaccine*

*The majority of the time, it is* \*very\* *unlikely*  

*If there are concerns it* \*could\* *be related, the studies STOP until their dedicated safety monitoring team can collect and review all the relevant information to ensure they are happy the study is safe to continue*

*These reviews are extremely rigorous*  

*In a trial with 10's of 1000's of patients, it is common for them to pause for review of medical events which may have happened anyway, regardless of the participant being in the trial*

*But no one takes chances. Safety comes first, and we work hard to ensure it's safe.*

TL;DR  

It's common for vaccine trials to be paused ""for review of medical events"", which is what has happened here.

"Well when it‚Äôs time for the kids to go to school they go to a new place, obviously.
Usually as toddlers they stayed around the house, walked outside a bit with his mom but not too much interaction with other human beings.
But once you go to school there are 20 other kids, perhaps even more.
But when those are all vaccinated, they could potentially carry a disease like measles.
Or anything for that matter.
And don‚Äôt get sick, or too sick.
But once they infect little Timmy, Timmy will have to fight for his life.
Because of all a vaccine does is prepare your body for when the actual disease swings by.
But when it didn‚Äôt have time to prepare anti bodies and learn how the disease attacks.
Its truly is a battle of life or death and could cause permanent damage to timmy‚Äôs body.
Like polio can make a child deaf, or paralyzing parts of the body.
But the conclusion is, lil timmy isn‚Äôt protected , isn‚Äôt prepared for a disease like the other kids.
So once he gets it, chance of death is high.

But you did not answer the question, you‚Äôre dodging it.
So how does it work according to you?",ip5csg,2020-09-10 06:16:12

Although the newer, third generation vaccines are created using biotechnology so that they are not exaggerated by the  body, the chances of vaccine related disease is significantly low.

That's a good question. Each strain has a slight mutation as it replicates.

Knowing how our antibodies create a defense could tell us how many strains the vaccine could stop. Hard to tell this early.,inofja,2020-09-11 08:22:13

There are bacterias and viruses floating around but no one is chronically ill. That is because the body fights off every foreign substance. 
The hypothesis for coronavirus vaccine will work for anyone who has a great chance of being infected. It will also work for those already infected as it will cause release of antibodies, which will sort of work like army of the body and attack the virus. 
Rabies vaccine works the same way. If you're bit by a rabid animal, you take shots afterwards.

what do you mean ? it is only established after such a study has been done and reproduced by other teams. I agree that after this, a saline placebo isn't necessary in further studies though.

Also there are people that refuse to vaccinate their children, so we may as well use those as controls since we cannot force them, and in that case there is nothing unethical.

Correct. (That was how such trials were done ~50 years ago.)  

> what do you mean ? it is only established after such a study has been done and reproduced by other teams.  

No, there are many other kinds of studies that can be done to establish/affirm a safety profile.  
[Example](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2101)

> Also there are people that refuse to vaccinate their children, so we may as well use those as controls since we cannot force them, and in that case there is nothing unethical.  

Yes, for example the cohort study above has a group of [4729 unvaccinated children](https://i.imgur.com/UWw1Don.png).  

Placebos are normally used in prospective *randomized* controlled trials, which as mentioned earlier are both unethical and unnecessary.

Indeed now I understand why you say it would be unethical if we want a r*andomized* blinded study.

I don't understand why retract a study, wouldn't it be more helpful to publish it and also explain why it is bad ? just retracting or trying to censor it would most likely result in a streisand effect, whereas explaining how it is faulty would enlighten people and raise awareness. Your second link does a great job of explaining that.

Science today really seems to suffer from a lack of reliable data and immutable data along the study process. I think all of this will be greatly enhanced soon by the blockchain and projects like [ehrdata.com](https://ehrdata.com/) because not only it makes sure the data is reliable and can be verified later, but the blockchain would also ensure that the data is immutable as it is recorded during the study process. And it will also allow more diversified funding from ""normal people"" to reduce the funding bias.",in6u2n,2020-09-09 01:31:08
"These are great ideas. Legal liability should never been reduced as you say.

Filming everything would be a good idea too but it doesn't solve the problem of being able to select the data that you want and not include the data that you don't like in the results.

I think the blockchain could be a great solution to solve that, because you can publish what is called a hash of a document on the blockchain which allows you to not reveal the data until a later date but when you do, anyone can check that you issued all of the data because only the entire data can compute to the hash you published previously. This would allow huge data like films to be provably unaltered.

The scientific process would benefit hugely from such honesty. 

For text and numerical data it could be published as the data is gathered so that it is publicly accessible as it is gathered which prevents any further manipulation.

You could also publish scientific studies directly on the blockchain which would remove the need for publication journals, and anyone would be able to respond on the blockchain to explain the flaws or reproducibility or the study, and when anyone would access the study they would also see all the answers, which would reduce biases of only seeing things that validate your beliefs",in6u2n,2020-09-13 16:20:29
"I presume OP is primarily concerned with side effects, which you would test by looking for any medical issue that is more common among vaccinated people than the placebo group

Effectiveness is determined by comparing the number of people in the vaccine group who get measles to the number in the placebo group who get measles, however, the effectiveness of measles vaccine is well documented already, so leaving the placebo group unvaccinated for long enough that a significant number of people in the placebo group would get measles would probably be unethical (in the US measles is rare enough that they would probably die of old age before a statistically significant number got measles, rendering this test pointless for the purpose of effectiveness testing)",in6u2n,2020-09-05 22:54:00

Unfortunately there is plenty of science calling the safety of these products into question. However there is a 60 billion dollar per year industry pushing a narrative that vaccines are unequivocally safe. That is not true. Billions have been paid to compensate for adverse vaccine reactions including brain damage. According to HHS only 1 percent of vaccine reactions are reported.

https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf

Science does not support the proposition that these products are 100% necessary and safe, but in fact suggests they are the root of the epidemic of autism and auto immune disease we face in the US. Take a look at HBV.

Recent studies from a top Chinese university have shown a potential link between HBV vaccine given after birth and autism/neurological impairment. These are the first studies of their kind. This 2016 mice study shows significant neurological effects from just one round of the hep b vaccine:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/

This well sourced paper explains the importance of animal studies in analyzing vaccine toxicity:

http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Animal-Studies.pdf

The 2016 mice study speaks for itself:

‚ÄúThis work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and multiple sclerosis.‚Äù

This is testing ONE vaccine. Not the cumulative effect of the combined aluminum injected into children under the ever increasing modern vaccine schedule. A 2018 follow up study on the mechanics of this process found the following:

‚ÄúThese findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.‚Äù

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29751176/

Paul Patterson's research at Caltech supports the proposition that a vaccine induced immune activation event could lead to autism and other neurological dysfunction.

http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4166/

Hep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial that would uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it to every child born in America on the first day of life. However the vaccine has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles) until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-has-highest-first-day-infant-mortality-out-of-industrialized-world-group-reports/

https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/1/8/16863656/childhood-mortality-united-states

HBV is one vaccine we should probably take off the schedule. Not everyone asking for safer vaccines is ignorant or scientifically illiterate.

More information on HBV, AL, and autism:

‚Å†The US Austim rate is skyrocketing (most likely do to an environmental factor). https://health.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20090218_autism_environment/ ‚Å†The US vaccine schedule and resulting aluminum nanoparticle exposure is coincidentally skyrocketing at the same pace as autism. https://www.safeminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/aluminum-and-mercury-in-vaccines-through-2007-ayoub.pdf ‚Å†The relationship between aluminum vaccine adjuvant and autism rates has NEVER been properly studied. http://vaccinepapers.org/category/aluminum/ ‚Å†The relationship between the hep b vaccine and autism is likewise almost completely unstudied. Hep b is injected into most newborns in the US in their first hours of life. http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Neonatal-hepatitis-B-vaccination-impaired-the-behavior-and-neurogenesis-of-mice-transiently-in-early-adulthood..pdf ‚Å†Biological studies empirically show that aluminum adjuvants make their way to the brain in mammals. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302736 ‚Å†Recent mice studies out of China demonstrate a mechanism through which those adjuvants elicit an immune response, causing neurological damage upon reaching the brain. http://vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/Wang%20Yao%202018%20Cytokine%20IL-4%20Hep%20B%20Hippocampus.pdf ‚Å†There is no compelling reason to vaccinate infants for hepatitis b, especially in light of this emerging science, unless the mother is hep b positive. Developed countries that do not vaccinate for hep b, like Denmark, have better under 5 health outcomes. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.dyn.mort?view=map&year_high_desc=false compare with: http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/hepatitis-b

8) A recent UK study shows elevated aluminum levels in autistic brains, apparently from aluminum adjuvant transported there by the immune system. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763

Phamacuitical products should be thoroughly tested before  human consumption. Considering there is no compelling reason to vaccinate newborns for Hep B, if the mother is negative, we should probably pull it from the schedule at least until more animal studies give us additional insight into the role of aluminum nanoparticles in triggering an immune response/cytokines in the brain, leading to possible neurological damage.",imfg3h,2020-09-04 16:34:24

Autism is also a multi genetic disorder, with six to 10 genes involved, and again, the genes that have been identified thus far (neuroligins 3 and 4, En-2, and Hox-a1) are very important in embryonic brain development. Furthermore, there are environmental risk factors for autism. Valproic acid, which is used to treat epilepsy, causes a dramatic increase in the risk of autism when taken by women before they know they‚Äôre pregnant""..."" A review of the literature by Andrea and Roland Ciaranello at Stanford concluded that ‚Äúthe principal nongenetic cause of autism is prenatal viral infection.‚Äù This was based primarily on studies of an epidemic of rubella, or German measles, in New England in 1964""..."" Of course, rubella is not common anymore, because we get vaccinated against it, but the point is that maternal infection can increase the risk for autism. Other infections have also been implicated‚Äîa paper just came out last week linking genital herpes infection with an increased risk for autism."" Can you direct me to the page where it talks about ""vaccine-induced immune activation"" because I'm not finding it? The only thing I found relating to vaccines is the author(s) of the paper asking this question on the last page, "" Finally, I want to ask a question that‚Äôs come up in the literature in the last few years‚Äîshould we really be promoting universal maternal vaccination?""

Study 6: What does a 7-year-old article speaking about premature babies, antibiotics and lack of medical care for women living in poverty have to do with the HepB vaccine?

Study 7: What does this article have to do with HepB vaccines? This article is literally about health care access in the U.S. Many women living in poverty lack access to health care and miss opportunities to be educated before, during and after pregnancy. 

Study 8: Correct - Autism is increasing due to the host of chemicals and infectious microbes in the environment, but this has nothing to do with vaccines.

Study 9: This chart has nothing to back up their claims.. Where is the source? If you look at the charts, there is nothing to reference. Need more information on this, please.

Study 10: I like how the author(s) uses their prior articles as references to this cross-sectional article, not ""study"" as they claim. They are making a flawed claim that injected aluminum sneaks its way into the brain by hiding in macrophages leading to autism and other neurological disorders. This doesn't even make any sense and is exaggerated as well as hypothetical. I would be more than happy to discuss in detail my thoughts about this article once I read all references in full.

Study 11: Please see my comment regarding study 2. Intraperitoneal, again...

Study 12:   In this study, they measured the pharmacokinetics of AH in rabbits, using radioactive aluminum (as radioactive-based analytical methods are the method of choice to quantify metals).¬†They injected two rabbits with an intramuscular injection of AH at a concentration of 13.24 mg/mL. In an equivalent dose, each rabbit got ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù with 0.85mg of AH. According to the FDA guidelines, the amount of AH present in vaccines sold in the US has a maximal amount of 1.25mg/dose with a cumulative amount (the total amount you will get from vaccines) estimated at 4.22 mg over the infant vaccination schedule.

Study 14: This mortality rate map has nothing to do with vaccines, but always a good source for research if you want to learn more about mortality throughout the world. 

Study 15:   The SIX countries that have yet to introduce universal immunization against hepatitis B have very low endemicity and consider hepatitis B to be a limited public health problem, thus not justifying the additional expense.

"I appreciate you actually reading this material and commend you for being thorough and mostly fair. Many of your specific comments are accurate regarding limitations of specific studies to make assertive claims regarding causality and vaccines. However, I disagree with your characterization of some of this work as ‚Äúflawed‚Äù because it provides reliable data regarding physiological implications of injecting aluminum salts. For instance you seem to summarize Flarend without acknowledging the evidence that aluminum salts unequivocally migrated to the brain in that experiment. The data I am citing about infant mortality  is, out of context, irrelevant, but in context with geographical vaccination patterns represents an important signal. See below:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/

This well sourced article responds to your critique of Mold 2017:

https://vaccinepapers.org/high-aluminum-content-autistic-brains/

I'm citing peer reviewed university research empirically demonstrating that HBV/aluminum adjuvant is neurotoxic in certain circumstances. The government's expert witness in autism court, leading scientist Andrew Zimmerman, has come out and reversed his stance on vaccines and autism:

https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/425061-how-a-pro-vaccine-doctor-reopened-debate-about-link-to-autism

There are valid scientific reasons to question the neurological safety of al salts.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/

The professional researchers carrying out this study found that HBV had a neurotoxic effect.

""This work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders suchas autism and multiple sclerosis (Gallagher and Goodman, 2010; Stubgen, 2012). This study used the same vaccine and a similar time schedule to those used for human infant vaccination in China. Therefore, these findings suggest that there may be similar effects of neonatal HBV vaccination on brain development and behavior in humans.""

This is a 2018 study on the subject:

‚ÄúThese findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.‚Äù IL-4 mediates the delayed neurobehavioral impairments induced by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination that involves the down-regulation of the IL-4 receptor in the hippocampus.""

Wang X, et al. Cytokine. 2018. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29751176/

This 2018 study found brain damage from the aluminum adjuvant used in HBV.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29221615/

""This is the first experimental study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that aluminum adjuvants can impair social behaviour if applied in the early period of postnatal development.""

This 2017 study likewise found that low dose aluminum adjuvant impaired behavior:

""Neurobehavioural changes, including decreased activity levels and altered anxiety-like behaviour, were observed compared to controls in animals exposed to 200Œºg Al/kg but not at 400 and 800Œºg Al/kg. Consistently, microglial number appeared increased in the ventral forebrain of the 200Œºg Al/kg group.""

"If you recall, the study you are referencing ends less than 1 week after the administration of the final vaccine dose. It is also not a safety trial by any stretch of the imagination. There was no placebo control group and no follow up past one week. The language I used ‚Äúlonger than one week‚Äù was qualified with ‚Äúsafety trial.‚Äù 

Is that the sole data you are relying on? A manufacturer study from 30 years ago that ended days after the final dose? Autism is diagnosed around 4 years old...",imfg3h,2020-09-04 21:04:32
"Most of the studies I refer to as ‚Äúflawed‚Äù are quite literally flawed when it is being compared to vaccines. The mice studies you gave us regarding the HepB vaccine are injected differently in the mice versus a human. The studies you referenced state that they injected the mice via intraperitoneal and not intramuscular. There is a big difference between the two injections and how the body reacts to it. Most vaccines should be given via the intramuscular route into the deltoid or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. This optimizes the immunogenicity of the vaccine and minimizes adverse reactions at the injection site. 

Flarend, et al estimated the amount absorbed over 28 days to be 17%. This means the amount absorbed is the amount that was able to diffuse through the epithelial barrier from the connective tissue into the bloodstream. Also, 82% of the Aluminum is still present at the site of the injection. If it does not absorb, then it is not absorbed because why? Solubility. Al(OH)3<\_> Al3 + 3OH- (equilibrium equation). If we consider the amount absorbed over 28 days, then we can deduct that the bioavailability is about 0.6%, which is a tad bit higher than its absorption via the GI tract. Therefore, AH releases its own aluminum at a very slow pace. This is why we have the biphasic curve after Cmax. Lastly, Flarend, et al., estimated that AH mostly accumulated in the kidney then the spleen and liver. These organs are highly perfused with blood and may accumulate more aluminum than any other organ. These organs are always monitored when drugs are being developed as they can have toxic effects. Flarend, et al., reported an amount of 0.0001mg/g of tissue after 28 days. So, at the time of injection, this tissue concentration may have peaked around 0.000283mg/g. Brain tissue, in contrast, has shown 100 times less accumulation than the kidney. After 28 days, 3% of the initial aluminum injected remained in the kidneys. Thus, only 0.03% of the initial amount accumulated in the brain. Aluminum has a long half-life, which is estimated at around 100 days.  

You‚Äôre correct. The data you cited regarding infant mortality is irrelevant, but it is not in context with geographical vaccination patterns. 

Study 1: Did you read this 2011 study written by an independent researcher and an independent computer scientist with multiple conflicts of interest that they failed to include? If so, I have questions. Why are the authors using data from 2009? (please see figure 1 in their study). Did you notice the way count the vaccines? It is full of mistakes. Since they are going by shot and not antigen, why are the DTaP, IPV, Hib and hepB counted as 4 shots in Austria, when they are only given one shot called Infanrix Hexa. Oh, let‚Äôs talk about Germany. The German vaccine schedule has DTap, IPV, Hib, hepB, PCV (2, 3 and 4 months) with 4th round shots between 11-14 months, MenC, varicella and MMR with a lower age limit of 11 months. This means that German children should be put in the highest rank for vaccines, but the authors did not do that. Why? Why did the authors only look at one year of data when there‚Äôs years‚Äô worth of data available? If there is truly a relationship between infant mortality and vaccines, then there would be a strong connection using multiple analyses from multiple years‚Äô worth of data. Why did they only look at the U.S. and the 33 nations with better infant mortality rates than the U.S? Why not include those nations with higher infant mortality rates than the U.S.? Again, if there was truly a correlation between infant mortality and vaccines, then there would be enough information to show comparisons of more nations than just the 34 used. They cherry-picked their study based on the data they analyzed. Lastly, this analysis did not adjust for vaccine composition, national vaccine coverage rates, variations in the infant mortality rates among minority races, preterm births, differences in how some nations report live births or the potential for ecological bias.",imfg3h,2020-09-09 15:28:40

"As mentioned before;  
It's a safety *summary* comprised of ""A total of 97 clinical trials"" in ""28 different countries"" and **lasted 36 months**, with safety assessments ""on the day of vaccination and for three days afterward"" according one of these two schedules ; Months 0, 1, and 2 followed by a booster dose at Month 12, or three doses at Months 0, 1, and 6.

"Study 2 (part 1): It took me a while to go through everything that was cited by the unknown author of vaccine papers and everything just goes in circles. However, I will do my best to break down everything study by study. 

The author(s) cite the 2011 Tomljenovic and Shaw‚Äôs ‚ÄúDo aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism‚Äù study. In Table 1 of this study, Tomljenovic, et al. tried to convince us that the inflammatory aspects of various autoimmune diseases share aspects with inflammation provoked by aluminum adjuvants. Inflammation can be provoked by multiple things. The cytokine profiles that Tomljenovic, et al. point to as being similar to cytokine profiles due to aluminum adjuvants are the same sorts of cytokine profiles that result from almost any sort of injury. If I were a surgeon and I cut open your abdomen in order to rearrange your anatomy for therapeutic intent, I bet I could find studies with cytokine profiles that I could tenuously compare to cytokine profiles due to vaccination with aluminum-containing vaccines. Tomljenovic, et al. point out that inflammatory bowel disease results in ‚ÄúIncreased NLRP3 inflammasome complex signaling and NLRP3-dependent overproduction of IL- 1√é¬≤, IL-6, IL-18, TNF- √é¬± and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MS, EAE, Type 1 diabetes mellitus \[164-166\] and animal models of IBD \[167\],‚Äù while the aluminum adjuvant can similarly ‚Äúactivate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex and NLRP3- dependent cytokines \[33,34,172\].‚Äù This is not in the least bit surprising, given that the NLRP3 system is activated by a wide range of ‚Äúdanger signals.‚Äù They also recognize autism and Gulf War Syndrome as ‚ÄòAutoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. Gulf War Syndrome doesn‚Äôt exist as a single distinct syndrome and is rather many health problems with different etiologies. They list autism spectrum disorder as being linked to Al-adjuvanted vaccines. This is assuming facts, not in evidence. There is no solid evidence linking vaccines to autism and several large epidemiological studies that have utterly failed to find a link between vaccines and autism. The ‚Äúevidence‚Äù in the paper consists mainly of Tomljenovic, et al. comparing increasing ASD prevalence to the increasing number of vaccines in vaccine schedules in various countries, their argument being that increasing doses of aluminum through vaccines correlates with the increasing prevalence of ASD. Basically, they collected data on ASD diagnoses for children from ages 6-21, from 1991-2008 from the US Department of Education Annual Reports for ASD prevalence. Next, they tried to correlate the autism prevalence in this group with the cumulative aluminum dosage they received before age 6 through the pediatric vaccination schedule. They then basically did the most simplistic analysis imaginable, plotting the minimum, mean, and maximum aluminum exposures against ASD prevalence. Can you say ‚Äúecological fallacy‚Äù? Also, they appeared to make no attempt to control for birth cohort other than to remove vaccines from their calculations that hadn‚Äôt been introduced into the schedule at the time the children were vaccinated. Although the diagnostic criteria used for autism and ASDs were set in 1994 in the DSM-IV, screening in schools, increased availability of services, and decreasing stigma to a diagnosis of autism led to an explosion in autism diagnoses. The way to control for this would have been to examine much more narrowly defined birth cohorts. They didn‚Äôt. They used a single 15-year period. They also did nothing more than look for a linear correlation between aluminum dose and autism prevalence, citing r = 0.92, instead of calculating r2. The authors are for some reason impressed by this, even though it‚Äôs not so hard to produce high Pearson coefficients for a lot of seeming correlations that in fact don‚Äôt have anything to do with each other. Lastly, they list criteria numbers one and two as being satisfied for aluminum and autism. Those are strength and consistency. The problem with these criteria is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be evaluated by one study. They conclude their association is strong because they have a high Pearson correlation coefficient, but their study is an outlier. It‚Äôs not correct to say that the correlation is strong based on the totality of the evidence. They also try to convince us that one of Bradford-Hill‚Äôs other criteria, such as biological rationale and coherence, has been met because of their attempt to make the tortuous vague resemblances between cytokine profiles they constructed to seem like strong evidence for biological plausibility. Even worse, they try to use their confusion of correlation with causation as an argument that there is a temporal relationship between the purported cause and the effect. It‚Äôs not. In fact, they have not convincingly met any of Bradford-Hill‚Äôs criteria, much less eight out of nine.",imfg3h,2020-09-09 15:29:31

And no you are not born with autism and you are misrepresenting those studies. Autism has a genetic predisposition just like obesity, heart disease, cancer, etc. Government witness and leading pediatric neurologist Andrew Zimmerman now recognizes a link, and asserts that low mitochondrial function is the genetic susceptibility factor.

"Study 2 (part 2): Now, for the Mold, et al. 2017 paper by Dr. Exley‚Äôs research group. Let‚Äôs begin with the introduction. This introduction is rubbish. Aluminum has not been linked with autism. There is no good evidence available showing us that aluminum in vaccines causes autism. Also, Mold, et al. cite papers by Tomljenovic and Shaw, which I discussed, above. Anyways, let‚Äôs move on to the actual study. The authors of this paper obtained brain tissue samples from autistic people from the Oxford Brain Bank, which is hosted in the Department of Neuropathology of the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Academic Unit of Neuropathology of the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences of Oxford University. The bank stores sample and clinical data relevant to research into neurological diseases. From this bank, it appears that Exley received five specimens of frozen brain tissue (four males, one female, age range 15-50), consisting of samples from tissue from temporal, frontal, parietal and occipital lobes and hippocampus of each individual. Aluminum levels were measured using transversely heated atomic absorption spectroscopy. Also, the authors received frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal and hippocampal tissue from ten donors (three females and seven males) with a diagnosis of ASD was supplied by the Oxford Brain Bank as three 5 Œºm thick serial paraffin-embedded brain tissue sections per lobe for each donor. These were subjected to staining with the fluorescent probe lumogallion, which is purported to be a selective stain for aluminum in cells and was first used to localize aluminum in plant roots. It‚Äôs sold, however, by Santa Cruz Biotechnology as a stain for aluminum, gallium, and other metals. The stained sections were then subjected to fluorescence microscopy to visualize where the lumogallion binds to aluminum in the tissue. What are the problems with this? Firstly, there are no controls. If Mold, et al. were accessing the Oxford Brain Bank to obtain tissue from autistic people, then why couldn‚Äôt he have also obtained brain tissue from age-matched normal controls? If the bank doesn‚Äôt have such tissue, then it should have been justified. Either way, the relevance of these measurements are suspect, given that we have nothing to compare them to. There‚Äôs also an extreme paucity of clinical information about the samples used. There are no dietary histories, no medical histories, and all with very small sample size. While dietary history might be hard to come by in a typical database associated with a tissue bank, there‚Äôs no excuse for not including medical histories, given that the Oxford Brain Bank definitely includes clinical information about the patient from which each sample came from. Secondly, the raw aluminum levels measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy are reported as ranging from 0.01 (the limit of quantitation) to 22.11 Œºg/g dry weight. Mold, et al. goes on further to report that the aluminum content of all tissues ranged from 0.01 (the limit of quantitation) to 22.11Œºg/g dry wt. and that the aluminum content for whole brains (n=4 or 5 depending upon the availability of hippocampus tissue) ranged from 1.20¬±1.06) Œºg/g dry weight.to 4.77¬±4.79 Œºg/g dry weight. Mold, et al. then cites a previous study of Exley, which he refers to as ‚Äúour 60 brain study,‚Äù that has ‚Äúallowed us to define loose categories of brain aluminum content beginning with ‚â§1.00 Œºg/g dry wt. as pathologically benign (as opposed to ‚Äònormal‚Äô).‚Äù Look up this study and you will see that it‚Äôs quite confusing. In the Exley study they referenced, Exley reported measuring aluminum levels in the brain of one man, a 69-year-old who had died of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Either Exley messed up the reference, or he hoped that no one noticed that he had referred to a reference that doesn‚Äôt describe what he claims it described. Sloppy work, huh? Anyways, if you read his ‚Äú60 brains‚Äù paper, Exley notes that the values he measured for aluminum didn‚Äôt follow a normal distribution. We see the same thing in the Mold, et. al paper, with these widely varying values in his replicates. As a result, it would have been more appropriate to use the median rather than the mean, which is what he did in his ‚Äú60 brains‚Äù paper. Yet in this paper, for some odd reason, he uses mean values. Of course, mean values result in seemingly larger values for aluminum content. Hmmm, I wonder why? Thirdly, Mold, et. al. makes a number of conclusions, such as that aluminum located in inflammatory cells associated with the vasculature, in round and amoeboid glial cell bodies, neurons and glia-like cells, and other areas. If you look at the figures for which these claims are made, then you would be like, ‚Äúumm, what the hell?‚Äù There are specific stains for such cells and structures. If you really want to know where the aluminum is localized, you stain with both the stain for aluminum and a different stain with a different colored fluorescent molecule attached, and then you can tell. The fluorescence microscopy is dodgy, and it is vastly overinterpreted. That doesn‚Äôt even take into account the nonexistent to weak statistics in the paper. The overinterpretation can be found in the discussion portion of the Mold, et al. paper. 

Study 3: This is an opinion article written by Sharyl Attkisson, an opinion contributor for ‚ÄúThe Hill‚Äù. This is not a peer-reviewed study. There is not even a peer-reviewed study referenced in this article. However, since we are on the topic of Dr. Zimmerman, did you read his press release through the University of Massachusetts Medical School where he retired from clinical practice? While I do not believe Dr. Zimmerman is truly an anti-vaxxer, I believe he‚Äôs giving anti-vaxxers the opportunity to make him out as one. His deposition is picked apart to fit their narrative. Please read his deposition along with his press release in full.  

Study 4: Again, per the study, ‚Äúmice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with HBV or phosphate-buffered saline.‚Äù The HBV is injected via the deltoid muscle or anterolateral aspect of the thigh in humans. IP injection should not be a preferred route for evaluating vaccines, which are usually given by the intramuscular (IM) route in humans, rarely subcutaneously (SC). To mimic the human response in mice, the SC route should be preferred because it is difficult to inject mice with accuracy by the IM route due to the very small amount of muscles mice have.

"Current med student and former microbiologist/logistics tech. I've worked in a lot of hospitals and EDs and this scenario you mentioned....is so abysmally unlikely.

The process of developing a vaccine, testing it, doing continuous batch testing, and so on is extremely rigorous and is a big part of the reason big pharma doesn't like to make them. It's not profitable and a huge time sink. There are a few vaccines when you use stuff like live attenuated viruses that get through every so often, but you have better odds of winning the PowerBall lottery. It's ludicrous how far they go to ensure safety. There are also mandatory reporting on any issues caused by vaccines so we can ensure nothing is wrong with them on a large scale. This is done by both private quality control and federal regulators, thousands of times over long periods of time.

I noticed you mentioned to someone else there should be a ""litmus test"". There are a few reasons this isnt necessary.

A litmus test for anything is generally not very accurate. They're meant to be general, fast, on-the-fly ways of testing low stakes qualities like ""is there enough chlorine in my pool water?"".

You know what is accurate? Thousands of chromatography, spectrophotometry, and proteomic analyses done by the private manufacturer and federal regulators over the course of years, using millions of dollars. This is just looking at the physical vaccine itself, don't even get me started on clinical trials....

On to the scenario.

First of all, the trucks that transport these goods are secured and any missing personnel would be noticed immediately. You don't just ""lose"" a truck and act like nothing is wrong.

Assuming they manage to steal a shipment, suppress the drivers, and get to whatever destination they were supposed to be getting without getting any attention (lol), a lot of us know and recognize our delivery people on a first name basis.

Assuming all of this is still ok, tampering with the seal and successfully resealing it would be next to impossible without access to major manufacturing equipment. Pharmacists, nurses, physicians, and even med techs know better than to trust anything with a less than perfect seal. Remember they have to unseal, poison, and reseal in a timely matter, very unlikely.

Then after that, it needs to be administrated and not immediately kill the person.... Also very unlikely. This just just is not likely at all.

After all this effort, it would be much easier to shoot up a place or build a bomb, dontcha think?

I know these are scary times, but a botched/poisoned vaccine is honestly the least of your concerns. Diabetes, hypertension, cancer, suicide, car accidents, and other preventable problems (including the current pandemic)...these are the problems you should aware/alert of and take steps to NOT be a victim. These are things that are way more likely to kill you or me and these are things that we can prevent.

Please, take care of yourself and others. Don't burden yourself with undue worry about asinine hypotheticals. There are very real and very serious issues to take care of right now and we should all do our best to make sure we're all safe.",ilecqa,2020-09-04 04:19:18

What impresses me the most is the complexity of the process.    From development, to manufacture to actual distribution.    A very complex process.

"Well once the vaccine is designed and approved, manufacturing is relatively simple, hence the reason vaccines are so cheap.

I don't know much about those star wars or elon musk projects, so I'm not going to comment on them.

The research and initial development is complex IN ORDER to make it safe. If we streamlined every aspect of it, then we would have a lot of problems on our hands. This is what is happening with Russia's covid vaccine right now that they're giving Russian citizens and soldiers. The consequences for them might be big, they might be small. No one knows. But that's now how we operate in North America and the rest of Europe.

The development that the US, UK, and EU are doing is complex to make sure that consequences are not substantial or don't exist at all. We obsess over how to mold the virus into mRNA or an attenuation of the virus so it's not actually hurting us. Then we obsess over the adjuvants (think of this as the inactive ingredients) so we get an immune response big enough to develop immunity, but not so big that we go into shock. Then we test it on animals to make sure nothing is noticably wrong. Then small groups of people for immediate effects, larger groups for the short-middle term effects, and then larger groups to make sure everyone can handle it well.

Every step of the way so far is highly monitored and data is analyzed. This is what I mean when I say it's complex. Statisticians like my wife wade through hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of data points to make sure that no one is having a bad reaction. This is complex to be safe, not as a liability to safety.

THEN we release it to the public with constant surveillance to make sure nothing is developing.

I'm having trouble making a metaphor for this one, but it's kind of like building a bridge. You can slap one together in a day and risk it collapsing the same day or you can obsess over every detail and make it safe to use for a long time for a lot of people after you finish building it and you continue inspecting it very often.

The distribution may sound very complex, but in really it's much simpler than, say, Amazon or any major distributor like Target, Walmart, Costco.... Because it's one manufacturer for one product (vaccine) going to a handful of recipients (hospitals, pharmacies, clinics), rather than 1,000 manufacturers for 3,000 different products (toys, furnature, food) going to 30,000 locations (every single walmart in the country). Yet even with all that, we still manage to feed and furnish all Americans very well with little to no hiccups because logistics people are very good at their jobs. And if they're bad at their jobs... Well they're not working at logistics anymore, aren't they?

-

If the human body can handle it well, we probably wouldn't have made a vaccine for it.

Take polio. If you've ever been to India it's absolutely atrocious there. There are children and adults that's are absolutely ravaged by the virus. Paralysis, weak legs, constant vomiting, and an extremely high infant mortality rate. It's awful. 

We, as first world citizens, forget just how bad these diseases are when we don't see them first hand, thus we forget the utility of vaccines. I think a lot of people don't realize that there are immunosuppressed people who can't even handle vaccines, so it's our duty to vaccine and gain herd immunity to protect those who cannot protect themselves.

Before my grandpa passed away, chemotherapy destroyed a lot of his bone marrow (which is where your immune cells come from). If I got the flu, then it would be no deal for me as a healthy guy in my mid 20s, but for him, it would be terrible, possibly fatal.

So in summary, vaccines are better than getting sick ""naturally"" because you get immunity without getting sick and you get to protect others. It's a pretty good deal.

Also, there is no evidence right now to say ""natural"" immunity lasts longer than vaccine induced immunity. Even so, vaccines have boosters if you need them. Otherwise, you'd need to get sick again, and that's never fun.",ilecqa,2020-09-04 14:48:10

The majority get a simple rash, but for the immuno-compromised individuals, the vaccine may actually infect the person (if the virus is not dead). That's why they rely on us getting them and/or acomplishing herd immunity.

And it is estimated that the individuals who have adverse reactions to the vaccines is less that 1%, so the benefits outweight the risks. The only category that has a higher risk are the immuno compromised, as I said above.",ihulf2,2020-08-27 23:11:17

"So in terms of autism diagnosis, those can only happen around the age of 2 years old because signs are very difficult to determine before that. As such, you likely had autism since birth, but no one could tell until you got a little older.

This has been a huge sticking point since Andrew Wakefield (the guy that published the first big anti-vax paper) published his work. Autism signs show up most prominently around the same age that infants would get a lot of their vaccines. As such, one could mistakenly assume that they have something to do with each other, but in reality it's just a coincidence.",ihulf2,2020-08-28 22:21:43
"Definitely as a adult! As a adult, you are exposed to so many different people and it's good to have that cushion knowing that you are protected. As for shots, it really depends on each one.

"Unfortunately there is plenty of science calling the safety of these products into question. However there is a 60 billion dollar per year industry pushing a narrative that vaccines are unequivocally safe. That is not true. Billions have been paid to compensate for adverse vaccine reactions including brain damage. According to HHS only 1 percent of vaccine reactions are reported.

https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf

Science does not support the proposition that these products are 100% necessary and safe, but in fact suggests they are the root of the epidemic of autism and auto immune disease we face in the US. Take a look at HBV.

Recent studies from a top Chinese university have shown a potential link between HBV vaccine given after birth and autism/neurological impairment. These are the first studies of their kind. This 2016 mice study shows significant neurological effects from just one round of the hep b vaccine:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/

This well sourced paper explains the importance of animal studies in analyzing vaccine toxicity:

http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Animal-Studies.pdf

The 2016 mice study speaks for itself:

‚ÄúThis work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and multiple sclerosis.‚Äù

This is testing ONE vaccine. Not the cumulative effect of the combined aluminum injected into children under the ever increasing modern vaccine schedule. A 2018 follow up study on the mechanics of this process found the following:

‚ÄúThese findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.‚Äù

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29751176/

Paul Patterson's research at Caltech supports the proposition that a vaccine induced immune activation event could lead to autism and other neurological dysfunction.

http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4166/

Hep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial that would uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it to every child born in America on the first day of life. However the vaccine has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles) until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-has-highest-first-day-infant-mortality-out-of-industrialized-world-group-reports/

https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/1/8/16863656/childhood-mortality-united-states

HBV is one vaccine we should probably take off the schedule. Not everyone asking for safer vaccines is ignorant or scientifically illiterate.

More information on HBV, AL, and autism:

‚Å†The US Austim rate is skyrocketing (most likely do to an environmental factor). https://health.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20090218_autism_environment/ ‚Å†The US vaccine schedule and resulting aluminum nanoparticle exposure is coincidentally skyrocketing at the same pace as autism. https://www.safeminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/aluminum-and-mercury-in-vaccines-through-2007-ayoub.pdf ‚Å†The relationship between aluminum vaccine adjuvant and autism rates has NEVER been properly studied. http://vaccinepapers.org/category/aluminum/ ‚Å†The relationship between the hep b vaccine and autism is likewise almost completely unstudied. Hep b is injected into most newborns in the US in their first hours of life. http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Neonatal-hepatitis-B-vaccination-impaired-the-behavior-and-neurogenesis-of-mice-transiently-in-early-adulthood..pdf ‚Å†Biological studies empirically show that aluminum adjuvants make their way to the brain in mammals. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302736 ‚Å†Recent mice studies out of China demonstrate a mechanism through which those adjuvants elicit an immune response, causing neurological damage upon reaching the brain. http://vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/Wang%20Yao%202018%20Cytokine%20IL-4%20Hep%20B%20Hippocampus.pdf ‚Å†There is no compelling reason to vaccinate infants for hepatitis b, especially in light of this emerging science, unless the mother is hep b positive. Developed countries that do not vaccinate for hep b, like Denmark, have better under 5 health outcomes. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.dyn.mort?view=map&year_high_desc=false compare with: http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/hepatitis-b

8) A recent UK study shows elevated aluminum levels in autistic brains, apparently from aluminum adjuvant transported there by the immune system. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763

Phamacuitical products should be thoroughly tested before  human consumption. Considering there is no compelling reason to vaccinate newborns for Hep B, if the mother is negative, we should probably pull it from the schedule at least until more animal studies give us additional insight into the role of aluminum nanoparticles in triggering an immune response/cytokines in the brain, leading to possible neurological damage.",ih3zmy,2020-08-26 20:06:54

"I'm citing peer reviewed university research empirically demonstrating that HBV/aluminum adjuvant is neurotoxic. The government's expert witness in autism court, leading scientist Andrew Zimmerman, has come out and reversed his stance on vaccines and autism:

I do strongly dissagree with the first sentence though, I have autism myself, and absolutely do not hate myself or anyone with autism, I used to avoid vaccines because I thought they caused, and therefore could worsen, autism. I would prefer to take a 1 in thousands risk of death than a large risk of a condition that would make life harder but would not kill me.

If there was a leak of a toxin from a chemical plant near you, and this toxin would not kill you, but could cause lifelong problems for those exposed to it, would you stay where you are, or would you drive away, even though driving always entails a risk of death from crashing? I think almost everyone would choose to drive, and this wouldn't mean they hate people harmed by exposure to this chemical

The article is badly written to make milk seem evil (especially the end paragraph) but casein has actually been found to strengthen the symptoms of autism. This isn‚Äôt some ploy to get everybody to hate milk. Other autism organisations have also talked about the links and a book I read called ‚Äôgeeks freeks and asperges syndrome‚Äô which I read to help out with my asd also talked about it. The book was written by a 14 year old boy with asperges syndrome and he talked about how a casein free diet helped him out. And I honestly don‚Äôt see why people are hating on this. With vaccines if you don‚Äôt vaccinate someone you will endanger them. If you don‚Äôt give someone milk there are many alternatives to get calcium.,idcm6g,2020-08-21 18:40:44
"Actually there‚Äôs a metabolic pathway called the chicamate pathway that humans don‚Äôt have, but the microbes that feed our plants and gut biota do.

There‚Äôs a reason autism levels are increasing and no it‚Äôs not because doctors simply didn‚Äôt recognize that kids can suddenly stop communicating or making eye contact until recently.  

So you are right, it is a genetic disorder.   Dr. Zach Bush is a good resource if you want to learn more.",idcm6g,2020-08-21 14:58:56

That isn't what I said.

I did say that companies themselves know their own products suck when they cannot achieve sales targets without forcing people to use their products.

The opposite is true to, companies know their product is a winner when it meets and achieves sales targets with little effort from the sales team.

Q - How does a company know their product sucks balls.  A - A company knows it's product sucks balls when the only sales strategy that can successfully make people buy it is to enforce sales with government mandates.

Regarding the flu vaccine. ie the topic of this post is flu vaccine mandates. Nobody wants it. Nobody has ever wanted it. The flu vaccine has always been a bad product with bad sales because nobody sees the need. It is desperate levels of cope to blame so called anti vaxxers on bad sales for flu vaccines. Flu vaccines have never sold well. Flu vaccines have always been a crap product that nobody want to buy. Go and cry into you little pharma loving hands all you like doesn't change the facts.

I feel really bad for parents like this sometimes. And I mean what genuine sympathy. I know as a parent that it just absolutely hurts and aches when something bad happens to your child. And you want so badly to believe that there is a reason or an explanation. Someone or something that can be blamed because that means maybe there was something that could be done. Sometimes the only thing to blame is genetics and there's nothing you can do about that. But these people live in a world where they end up doing more damage because they just can't accept but sometimes bad things just happen,ic02g3,2020-08-18 15:27:58

"My son (26) has epilepsy. Fuck this lady and fuck misinformation.

When he first had symptoms, we desperately looked for solutions. Every medication the doctor tried only changed the type of seizures or made them worse--our kid was acting like an outlier of each med's ""possible side effects."" It was frustrating. We even tried the keto diet, which didn't help in his case.

In searching for answers, my wife became anti-vax, convinced that his previous vaccinations were the cause (because of things she'd read who-knows-where, in the early days of the intarwebs). As a supportive husband, I went along with it, even though I didn't completely agree with it. At the time, I just didn't have hard information to the contrary, so I'd be on the losing end of any argument.

The more I learned, the clearer things became. Even though my wife was still opposed, and even though we didn't have a real ""answer"" for the cause or treatment of his seizures, I finally prevailed in getting him caught up on his vaccinations. For the next few days, she was watching him like a *hawk*, tho, for any sign of ""vaccine injury."" 

Of course, he was still having seizures off & on during that time, so whenever she pointed out ""Look! He had a seizure!"" I had to point out that the frequency and severity is 100% normal compared to his pre-vaccination days. 

Now, she's pro-vax, and I'm rabidly so. But it took some work, and even an exchange with a frustrated and angry doctor, to turn that corner.",ic02g3,2020-08-18 19:48:08

Autism:
A behavioral diagnosis for static encephalopathy derived from encephalitis, an autoimmune inflammatory response to a trigger that leads to sequelae that affects the overall health of the individual. Vaccines injected are the most invasive triggers.

We know so little about the human body. Autism is barely understood, but they believe now that it is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. There are clear links between immune activation and neurological issues. As well as links between heavy metals and autism. 

Autism is a complex range of Neurological developmental disorders the current rates of autism are 1 in 59 according to the CDC some studies show as high as 1 in 34. Autism is a catch-all word whose brains don‚Äôt function normally or have brain damage and vaccines do cause brain damage. The vaccine court has actually paid out a lot of compensation for brain damage when its medical term on the paperwork is encephalitis. But ‚Äúautism‚Äù aside there are MANY side effects to vaccines. Just the ones that they say are common and ‚Äúharmless‚Äù are actually quite dangerous. For example, seizures are very common and very dangerous. As a Dr. in my family stated ‚Äúa seizure is never ok or normal‚Äù. A seizure happens when there is ‚ÄúABNORMAL brain activity‚Äù. 
Another common side affect that is clearly associated with vaccines is autoimmune disorders. Look up ASIA - autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants. And if you know anything about how vaccines work then you should understand how it creates autoimmunity. So allergies, diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto‚Äôs), celiac, Lichen Sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, Guillian Barre Syndrome, Transverse Myelitis, etc... can all be caused by vaccines.

Immune activation and autism

One of the clearest disorders linked to vaccines is autoimmune diseases and encephalitis is a common side effect of vaccines. You also have the combination of autoimmune encephalitis that looks like autism.

Genetic and environmental factors
‚ÄúDue to the progress of autism in recent decades, a wide range of studies have been done to identify the etiological factors of autism. It has been found that genetic and environmental factors are both involved in autism pathogenesis.‚Äù

Science evolves through observation and discovery. In 1958 the CDC claimed that cigarettes didn‚Äôt cause cancer. In the absence of ‚Äúproof‚Äù of safety or harm they default to ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and then experiment on the population at large ‚Äúwatching‚Äù for additional side effects. Currently the CDC, who have many conflicts of interest say vaccines are safe and don‚Äôt cause autism. We have to ask the questions and push for scientific progress like we did with tobacco and there is enough evidence so far to justify larger better safety studies.

We are lacking in good true safety studies. There is no incentive to perform these studies though as any side effects found have to be listed on the package insert and could be added to the list of adverse reactions that could be compensated for in vaccine court. 
‚ÄúThe lack of evidence supporting vaccine safety is partially the result of the 1986 Act‚Äôs unfortunate scheme which places the same agency, HHS, in charge of two conflicting duties. On the one hand, HHS is responsible for vaccine safety. On the other hand, HHS is simultaneously required to promote vaccine uptake and defend against any claim that vaccines cause any harm.‚Äùhttp://icandecide.org/white-papers/VaccineSafety-Version-1.0-October-2-2017.pdf",i8yxfw,2020-08-18 15:16:55

I do not ban anyone for downvoting, I banned him because he told me he was downvoting every comment he sees me make about any topic because I disagreed with him on a political issue

I thought this was an abuse of the voting system in an attempt to trigger the post throttle on users he doesn't like, but after talking to him I realized this wasn't what he was doing

During this I talked to the mod of another sub, who told me that this user was a troll, and I questioned him if he was a troll, he has somehow interpreted this as ""lying to mods to get people banned""

He convinced me that he was not trying to abuse the post throttle nor was he a troll, so I unbanned him and I thought that was the end of it. This was the point where he repeatedly started calling me corrupt in the modmail, but I thought the issue was over

Fast forward to a week or 2 ago, and I became aware of realistic seeming users who were actually bots, so I tried using an AI bot that is supposed to tell me if users in my sub are bots, to trigger this AI I had to respond to the user in question ""are you a bot"", and the AI would respond in 1 minute by telling me if the user was a bot or not. I would then delete my ""are you a bot"" comment and the AI's comment so that neither the user in question nor others thought I was actually accusing anyone of being a bot

I did this with a bunch of users and was targeting no one in particular

However, I knew some users could be online at the time I asked if they were a bot, so I made a post explaining this in order to avoid anyone thinking i was personally accusing them

To avoid cluttering active threads with deleted comments, I was doing this with months old comments, when I got to u/ 4x4x4plustherootof25, he happened to be online right when I said ""Are you a bot?"", and he accused me of calling him a troll, so showed him the post explaining what I was doing, and he refused to believe me, insisting that I had singled him out and ending our conversation by calling me ""asshat"" and telling me to ""fuck off"", despite the fact that I had remained polite the entire time

Animemes culture does not equal weeb culture, I'm a weeb that actually defended the use of trap until a few months ago when I was told about what it means to many people.

">next year when they're told their children can't go to school without a Covid vaccine.

This may not happen, no one can be sure if or when a vaccine will come out, and if one does, there won't be enough for everyone right away, so it would go to higher risk groups first, which may not include school children. 

Even if the vaccine is recommended for school children, school vaccine rules are usually up to the state, in the strictest states the only way to go to school without vaccines is to have a doctors note that is then vetted by the health dept, while the least strict just require you to check a box on the health form that says you don't want vaccines

I expect states like NY and CA to mandate the vaccine for school as soon as it is recommended for that age croup by the CDC, but I'm not sure what OK or SD will do, I doubt every state will mandate vaccines and I don't know how much ability the feds have to interfere in state law

If vaccines are mandated, antivaxers will do what they normally do, try to get an exemption and if they can't they will homeschool or get vaccinated",i587xt,2020-08-07 07:13:16

"Yes, I did visit my mom within a month of getting a vaccine, and no they did not have any signs nor was i told I couldn't be with her. I think you need to do unbiased research about vaccines, and not look only at research only put out by anti-vax people. It honestly helped me understand vaccines more and get a grasp of how it benefits society to be vaccinated.

"they'll homeschool even tho last time I knew, this was America and was a free country. that's what my mom's doing. I read an article where they literally said that they needed people to get the vaccine so they can get money... they don't care about ppl, they care about the cash. if the COVID vaccine is anything like the flu vaccine, people are going to end up with COVID from the vaccine. plus, the people getting the vaccine are going to just shed it to everyone for a whole month after getting it. good way to spread corona",i587xt,2020-08-11 19:35:32

"The sad part is that it's so easy for many anti-vax people to get exemptions by claiming religious reasons or worried about reactions etc, but one thing that might happen is they will wait until the first round of people have the vaccine and make their decision based on that. Now obviously you will have the hard core anti-vaxxers who will make sure at all costs their child will not be vaccinated, but there might be a few who decide that they can't function in society unless they get the vaccine. And I'm hoping for the world's sake that they will go that route.",i587xt,2020-08-07 07:31:50
"Oh honey.... I think you're on the wrong subreddit. You don't ""shed"" a vaccine. Although you are injecting a small portion of the virus in you, this will likely not give you the virus. Vaccines were created to build up your immune system to a virus that way if you somehow contract it, it will not be as harsh considering your body has already dealt with it before. I think you need to research more on the science of vaccines in general before making a assumption that they are useless.",i587xt,2020-08-11 21:10:32

"What do they shed, if you don't mind me asking?",i587xt,2020-08-11 21:32:16
"they shed the virus that you got the shot for due to the fact that they put the virus in the vaccine. you can shed chicken pox after getting the chicken pox vaccine, as well as with other vaccines. there are signs at NICUs and cancer hospitals that state that if you've been recently vaccinated, you can't visit due to shedding",i587xt,2020-08-11 21:39:55
"First of all, in most vaccines the virus they inject in you is not alive, so how can you shed a virus that is dead and not even working? And secondly, NICU babies and people with cancer are in very fragile states, nicu babies having a very limited immune system since they have not had the chance to build one and could die even getting a common cold, and many people with cancer are in a similar scenario considering that chemo/radation weakens the body considerably and things like pneumonia can wipe a person out. And the little tid-bit about vaccinated people not being able to in a cancer ward, not true. My mother has had cancer twice and every time I have been able to visit her during her procedures.",i587xt,2020-08-11 21:51:59
"had you been vaccinated in the last 28 days or few weeks before visiting her? if so, maybe they didn't have that rule, but most places do. there are signs I've seen at some. I was a NICU baby and my mom told me that was true. many vaccines do have live viruses such as the flu shot, chicken pox vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella, etc. I'm unvaccinated and I can't shed something I don't have, and neither can other unvaccinated people. I can't shed chicken pox as I don't have it whereas someone who was recently vaccinated can shed it. 

if the corona vaccine is anything like the flu vaccine considering they're the same thing with different severities (although most cases of corona are mild and hardly deadly like the flu), people will shed corona or get it. my friend has gotten the flu every single time he's gotten the flu shot, and many other people end up with the flu after getting the shot too. there's a good chance the same thing will happen with the corona vaccine, which is why I'm not getting it",i587xt,2020-08-11 22:14:07

"you want to tell me that nobody has ever GOTTEN the disease/virus or had a horrible reaction just after getting the shot? funny, because there's a whole compensation fund for vaccine injuries and deaths. if it's so rare, why is there a whole fund that's collected millions of dollars, which is paid by a small tax on the vaccines? that is not how vaccines work. they're not supposed to give you it, supposedly they're supposed to build your immune system. there's a little bit of the virus in the vaccine, and according to you and other pro-vaxxers, it's just enough for your immune system to fight it off. not give it you. so last time I knew... the vaccine wasn't supposed to GIVE you the disease. you say the flu vaccine doesn't infect you but my aunt got the shot and then got the flu. every time my friend gets the shot, he gets the flu. it happens, which is why a lot of pro-vaxxers don't even get the flu shot.

the difference between pro-vaxxers and anti-vaxxers is that pro-vaxxers are total assholes. if you're vaccinated and they work sooo well, whether or not I'm vaccinated doesn't affect you. why do you care? you're protected, so leave me tf alone. anti-vaxxers don't care if you're vaccinated. that's your life, it's your body, and it doesn't affect me. soo... why not just mind your own damn business? you can inject whatever the hell you want into your body, don't shame me for not putting it in my body when it doesn't affect you. don't bother bringing up high risk people cuz I'm one of them :) idgaf if others are not vaccinated. my sisters aren't vaccinated either and I've been fine living with them",i587xt,2020-08-12 17:02:27
"But that defeat the purpose of herd immunity. That, and lawsuits, especially medical ones, are expensive. If there‚Äôs five non-vaccinated people in a room, and 95 vaccinated, then about 10 of the vaccinated are at risk for infection, because vaccines aren‚Äôt perfect. Also, immunocompromised individuals can‚Äôt always get a vaccine, so herd immunity is pretty much their only chance at survival. If a few people don‚Äôt get the COVID vaccine, they put the world at risk of a mutated strand of COVID. We‚Äôre assholes because we have more to loose than our own personal health. I, personally, am an asshole about it because members of my family are immunocompromised, and anti-vaxxers put her at risk, and I‚Äôve already had one scare due to a dumb bitch who wouldn‚Äôt get a vaccine and almost passed it on.  It‚Äôs not about you personally. You could die for all we care. It‚Äôs about everyone else. Do it for everyone else, not yourself. Also, the vaccine for the flu doesn‚Äôt give you the flu. It‚Äôs a non-active version. It‚Äôs not perfect, and vaccines don‚Äôt give total immunity, so being around people with the flu can still give it to you, it just makes that less likely, thus the often-misconceived notion that the Flu Vaccine gives you the flu.

"Not a doctor just a weirdo who reads medical papers and textbooks. 
If a vaccine alters the receptor alone for a virus in a cell the main downside would be when it alters it favorably for a future strain in the off chance. Like Russian flu survivors who then died of Spanish flu at 30. Otherwise the vaccine is temporary in the blood stream the only thing that is left behind is a reshaped keyhole for lack of a better analogy. It changed the locks. The chances of someone having the new key are incredibly slim. So the long term effects for something would be very limited. Since the predictability of a new strain makeup is slim and the vaccine itself doesn't hang around there isn't much to watch out for after it's cleared.",i3x6vp,2020-08-05 05:18:57
">most modern vaccines are so specific that spillover side-effects would be very unlikely

what does this mean?",i3x6vp,2020-08-05 03:40:00
"Long term safety for any medication including vaccines are done in phases 2, 3 and 4. Smaller sample sizes for phase 2, a larger sample size in phase 3 and post market surveillance in phase 4. Phase 3 is the main clinical phase for safety testing, which is divided into 4 sub stages with increasing sample size. Once safety has been established in phase 3, FDA or Health Canada or your country's health board can approve. Once approved, the pharma companies can then market. The health authorities will then conduct reviews and post marketing surveillance to watch out for any serious adverse events in the general population.

There have been cases where drugs and vaccines have been recalled post-market, however, that's rare and almost never nowadays due to the strict review processes. There are chances for labeling changes, however. For example, SSRIs got the black box warning at the post marketing stage. SGLT2 inhibitors also have a black box warning since just a year or 2 ago due to a few rare cases of flesh eating bacteria - these, however, occur more often on chronic medications. In summary, we can still confidently recommend any new drug or vaccine once health authorities approve as in majority of cases, the benefits will outweigh the minor risks though we can never be 100% certain as everybody is different. Vaccines are not something injected chronically, hence, the chances of this happening are close to 0.",i3x6vp,2020-08-09 14:51:37

>The fact that you believe not getting your shots makes some one ""an evil man starting an evil campaign to make the world anti vax"" shows how fake you are. 

I‚Äôve never read such bullshit in my life. Andrew Wakefield was the guy who started this whole ‚Äúvaccines cause autism and various other diseases and disorders‚Äù bullshit with his fraudulent Lancet study. So yes, he committed fraud to discredit a medical invention that saved lives. That makes him evil. And getting your shots is ultimately a whole hell of a lot better than not getting them, you fuck

George Soros did not break up IG Farben after the war. He was a child at the time. The Allies dissolved IG Farben . George Soros wasn‚Äôt old enough to drive and was not a Nazi. Moderna is not one of the spin-off companies created from IGF. It was born in 2010 in freakin‚Äô Massachusetts. Someone check a map, but I heard Massachusetts isn‚Äôt in Germany. So, sixty five years too late and the wrong continent.

Bill Gates went to Harvard, not Cornell (didn‚Äôt graduate) and so he wasn‚Äôt Fauci‚Äôs Cornell roommate. Fauci also graduated almost ten years before Gates‚Äô college years. Bill Gates isn‚Äôt the inventor or the patentor of the RFID chip. 

So Moderna is a ten year old company and somehow Fauci has had the same job since 1984. Let‚Äôs do the math...1984 was longer ago than 2010, I‚Äôm almost sure it is. Fauci does not and never did run Moderna. Love to see a source on that. 

Jeffrey Epstein did not make his fortune off Moderna. He was a wealthy ass years prior to its creation. There is no information contradicting whether he did or didn‚Äôt have SOME stock, but I‚Äôd like to see a source that proves he was the single largest shareholder. Considering what a heap of bullshit everything else in this ‚Äòexpose‚Äô is, I seriously doubt they pulled the source out of anything other than their ass.

"Here is a large population study covering 5 years that also took having a sibling with Autism into account in their study.

The conclusion: ‚ÄúIn this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD.‚Äù

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444


Because the concern about MMR and Autism has been around for so long, there are now lots of population studies around that look specifically at this risk.

For me, the most interesting thing is that if you Google population studies and look into the methods of each research project, it is clear that there are a lot of long-term databases from health insurers in various countries as well as country-wide databases from countries with single-payer health systems available to researchers. Then factor in how many people analyze this data (from insurers to calculate their future costs to providers to calculation the investment plans and then data science start-ups looking for new opportunities as well as data science students looking for new thesis projects). It would be a seriously difficult task for a secret conspiracy to manipulate the data from so many sources in such a way that it both hides an MMR risk and also hides the manipulation. Of course, none of this actually proves that there isn‚Äôt a risk, but it does demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that any such risk would have to be insignificantly small.

I smart-ass comeback that I have tried in discussions with people who believe in the big conspiracy is to tell them that I agree with them completely: if there is an organization big enough to manipulate data on this scale and paying its people so much money that they choose to remain quiet for their entire lives, then where I should send my resume?",i1najz,2020-08-01 10:40:05
"I found [this link](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr/mmr-studies.html) from the CDC. It sites a couple studies that are around 5 years long, some more some less. They more centered around the relation of the vaccine to autism, though these are scientific studies that have been conducted for more than 5 years so there's that.",i1najz,2020-08-01 07:06:40
"Thanks for the response. This link of the autism study is indeed very big and demonstrates that there is no link between this and the vaccine. All these studies helped me when arguing about autism. 

As to the second part of your response, one claim that comes often as well, is if such databases exist, why there are no studies that use this data and compare between the vaccinated and unvaccinated for everything. Meaning, not only autism but all kind of medical problems. They're saying that because there are no clinical trials, to make sure it's safe for the long-run, this is the only way to go.  What do you think about this? Is there any chance to analyze such databases and make such a comparison?

Also, can you please elaborate on this:

>""from insurers to calculate their future costs to providers to calculation the investment plans""   


Do you think that if such risk exists they would have noticed it? how?

"Vaccines are tracked continuously but very little gets published unless something interesting is found. Here is a recent example of something interesting turning up- a drop in the number of Type I Diabetes cases in children who had the rotavirus vaccine:

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2721243, and

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44193-4

The first article is research from Australia which does not have a lot of people- the discrepancy in the patient numbers is tiny but it was enough to trigger the attention of the agency that pays for diabetes treatment (and hence has to do budget planning and so notices when numbers are even slightly different from forecasts).

This leads to your next point. The business model of an insurer is to predict the future number of customers that will get each possible medical condition over a time period and then set a fixed price that each customer pays up front. So a health insurance company is watching the numbers very closely because they need to continuously update their models that they are using to predict costs. Their profits depend entirely on getting this right and they get bonus profits by finding and eliminating something that triggers costs.

On the other side are health care providers and school systems. They have to build and staff the facilities that help kids with Autism. Training staff takes years, so they also have to build models that predict the future numbers of children with a planning horizon that long enough ahead that they can do their planning properly. They are going to notice being flooded with unexpected numbers of kids with special needs.

In the US, school systems and health care provision are not strategically planned on a national scale, so it could be nobody is watching too closely. But in the rest of the developed world, both involve considerable amounts of public money that gets appropriated years in advance, so there are a lot of people paid to think deeply about predicting requirements and then finding explanations for differences between what really happens and what was predicted.",i1najz,2020-08-01 18:15:59

"Who is Bill Gates? 
‚ÄúHe's the guy who unreportedly added a sterilization formula to every single vaccine for the last 10 years and The World Health Organization had to admit it in court!‚Äù

From Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Childrens Health Defense Regarding Bill Gates

‚ÄùIndependent labs have found the sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally ADMITTED it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade. Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico and the Philippines. (As RFK Jr has pointed out - the way it works is, if any of this is false, then Bill Gates should sue him immediately for libel. However it‚Äôs not false, so he cannot).  Promising to eradicate Polio with $1.2 billion, Gates took control of India ‚Äòs National Advisory Board (NAB) and mandated 50 polio vaccines (up from 5) to every child before age 5. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine-strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between 2000 and 2017.

In 2017, the Indian Government dialed back Gates‚Äô vaccine regimen and evicted Gates and his cronies from the NAB. Polio paralysis rates dropped precipitously.

In 2017, the World Health Organization reluctantly admitted that the global polio explosion is predominantly vaccine strain, meaning it is coming from Gates‚Äô Vaccine Program. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, the Philippines, and Afghanistan are all linked to Gates‚Äô vaccines.

By 2018, ¬æ of global polio cases were from Gates‚Äô vaccines.

During Gates 2002 MenAfriVac Campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Between 50-500 children developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, ""We are guinea pigs for drug makers"". Nelson Mandela's former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates' philanthropic practices as ""ruthless"" and immoral"".

In 2010, Gates committed $ 10 billion to the WHO promising to reduce population, in part, through new vaccines. A month later Gates told a Ted Talk that new vaccines ""could reduce population"". 

In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a trial of a GSK‚Äôs experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,049 children.

In 2014, Kenya's Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a phony ""tetanus"" vaccine campaign.

In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by GSK and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country‚Äôs Supreme Court.

A 2017 study (Morgensen et.Al.2017) showed that WHO's popular DTP is killing more African than the disease it pretends to prevent. Vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of unvaccinated children. Gates and the WHO refused to recall the lethal vaccine which WHO forces upon millions of African children annually. Global public health advocates around the world accuse Gates of - hijacking WHO's agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases; clean water, hygiene, nutrition and economic development. They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal fetish - that good health only comes in a syringe.

In addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI and PATH, Gates funds private pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines, and a massive network of pharmaceutical -industry front groups that broadcast deceptive propaganda, develop fraudulent studies, conduct surveillance and psychological operations against vaccine hesitancy and use Gates' power and money to silence dissent and coerce compliance.
In this recent nonstop Pharmedia appearances, Gates appears gleeful that the Covid-19 crisis will give him the opportunity to force his third-world vaccine programs on American children.""

"Oller, John & Shaw, Christopher & Tomljenovic, Lucija & Karanja, Stephen & Ngare, Wahome & Clement, Felicia & Pillette, Jamie. (2017). HCG Found in WHO Tetanus Vaccine in Kenya Raises Concern in the Developing World. Open Access Library Journal. 04. 1-30. 10.4236/oalib.1103937. In 1993, WHO announced a ‚Äúbirth-control vaccine‚Äù for ‚Äúfamily planning‚Äù. Published research shows that by 1976 WHO researchers had conjugated tetanus toxoid (TT) with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) producing a ‚Äúbirth-control‚Äù vaccine. Conjugating TT with hCG causes pregnancy hormones to be attacked by the immune system. Expected results are abortions in females already pregnant and/or infertility in recipients not yet impregnated. Repeated inoculations prolong infertility. Currently WHO researchers are working on more potent anti-fertility vaccines using recombinant DNA. WHO publications show a long-range purpose to reduce population growth in unstable ‚Äúless developed countries‚Äù. By November 1993 Catholic publications appeared saying an abortifacient vaccine was being used as a tetanus prophylactic. In November 2014, the Catholic Church asserted that such a program was underway in Kenya. Three independent Nairobi accredited biochemistry laboratories tested samples from vials of the WHO tetanus vaccine being used in March 2014 and found hCG where none should be present. In October 2014, 6 additional vials were obtained by Catholic doctors and were
tested in 6 accredited laboratories. Again, hCG was found in half the samples. Subsequently, Nairobi‚Äôs AgriQ Quest laboratory, in two sets of analyses, again found hCG in the same vaccine vials that tested positive earlier but found no hCG in 52 samples alleged by the WHO to be vials of the vaccine used in the Kenya campaign 40 with the same identifying batch numbers as the vials that tested positive for hCG. Given that hCG was found in at least half the WHO vaccine samples known by the doctors involved in administering the vaccines to have been used in Kenya, our opinion is that the Kenya ‚Äúanti-tetanus‚Äù campaign was reasonably called into question by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association as a front for population growth reduction.",hy7lxr,2020-07-27 23:59:28

"I do personally believe in a higher power but there is no scientific evidence supporting it. There is no way of truly knowing what god is, or what religion has it right if any of them do. There is no proven evidence of a heaven or hell to be in existence. It's a false equivalence to say they should not have a platform because at the end of the day, while we can believe something could harm atheists, there is no scientific proof saying otherwise. They are not endangering the lives of those around them because they are atheists. Not getting vaccinated is literally putting people around you in danger. Atheism you have to make an active choice to have a possibilty of getting hurt by. But not vaccinating yourself takes away that safety from others. Spreading scientifically incorrect messages while there is data saying it is scientifically incorrect should not be allowed if it is putting others in danger. If you're in it just for the conspiracy part, just pick a different one that doesnt actively put others at risk.",hy3acc,2020-07-27 18:20:22

These other people will at the end of the day die and that‚Äôs it. While atheism they will die without the love of God in their hearts and suffer for ETERNITY.

"The vaccine wouldn't contain any human DNA despite being grown in human cell culture. Also, the only routine vaccination with any mercury is some flu vaccines, all the rest don't have any. 

Also also, MTHFR (stands for methyltetrahydrofolate reductase) is related to folate metabolism, it has nothing to do with mercury and to my knowledge the various polymorphisms of the gene don't have *any* clinical relevance other than possibly higher neural tube defects in the absence of folate supplementation (but the last time I looked even this was questionable). 

I'd suggest trying to get her to learn some basic chem and bio, if she'll listen to you at all on this. Most antivaxx stuff can be debunked with fairly low level toxicology and chemistry knowledge.",hwi9q3,2020-07-23 18:21:56

"For what it‚Äôs worth, first of all not all vaccines contain these cells, and secondly the fetal cells that are used are grown from some cells that originally came from a fetus, BUT:

They‚Äôre not, like, still going to a freezer and chipping pieces off the fetus from decades ago. A vaccine a kid gets today that contains these cells is getting something that would never be a baby and is NOT part of the original fetus. It isn‚Äôt like ‚Äòif only we left these stem cells out on the counter to warm up instead of sticking them in a vaccine, they‚Äôd grow into a baby‚Äô.

Also, even the Catholic Church is not fully against it. You may (or may not because you are young) know the Catholic Church is anti-abortion. I‚Äôm not Catholic, and you might not be either; the reason I mention it is this:

Their outlook is, look, it was wrong to abort the fetuses originally, BUT they have saved so many lives that it would be more wrong going forward to let people die when they don‚Äôt have to. People used to suffer, and now something exists that can spare us, and denying the mercy provided by vaccines would also be wrong.

Their position is that IF a stem-cell free alternative‚Äòedition‚Äô exists, then your ethical obligation is to choose that one. If there‚Äôs NOT an alternative version, it is morally permissible to use the fetal-cell version but you are ethically obliged to contact the manufacturer and tell them you want them to develop versions that use cell lines that didn‚Äôt come from the fetus lines. 

So. They want companies to phase out the fetal cell lines, but they do not believe that gambling a child‚Äôs heath is the appropriate way to protest. You protest and work to change it AFTER you get the kid the care that you owe it as the parent. 

The Vatican is as pro-life as it gets, so when even THEY can see that using vaccines containing cells that originally came from fetuses is a thing we can do, she should be able to.",hwi9q3,2020-07-23 20:49:07

If she takes it in the wrong way, then you need to get hard with her and explain to her that it is child abuse to refuse this.

"Anti-vaxx is essentially a psuedo-cult and unfortunately people in cults are extremely resistant to having their minds changed, it's why the failure rate for organisations that help people change their outlook and escape from this stuff is so high. There is generally a much higher chance of someone deciding to leave naturally on their own by learning on their own than external intervention.

One of the best options for intervention is reduction of exposure to sources of information that makes them think that way, facebook, twitter, partisan media, cable tv shows, karens. Unfortunately this probably isn't viable if its all coming from the internet and social circles and you cant ban them or child lock them from it.

Alternatively there is the interview approach, which I suspect works because they are the one doing the interview and its a face to face with real experience:

>One student interviewed a member of their church congregation who had shingles, recalling, ‚ÄúThe pain was so bad that she ended up at a pain management clinic where they did steroid shots into her spine. The pain meds didn‚Äôt even touch her pain, even the heavy ones. For months, she couldn‚Äôt leave the house.‚Äù Another student interviewed her grandmother, who suffered from tuberculosis. The student said of the experience: ‚ÄúI dislike the idea of physical suffering, so hearing about someone getting a disease made the idea of getting a disease if I don‚Äôt get vaccinated seem more real.‚ÄùResearchers found nearly 70 percent of the students who interviewed someone with a vaccine-preventable disease moved from vaccine hesitant to pro-vaccine by the end of the study ‚Äî even when they had NO vaccine curriculum. Overall, 75 percent of vaccine-hesitant students increased their vaccine attitude scores, with 50 percent of those students moving fully into pro-vaccine attitudes.

Someone who has had a particularly awful time with covid might be a good choice, convince her to interview them about the experience. But make sure the person you pick isn't antivax too or it would backfire.

""If a parent is not available, then the physician can first look to a step-parent, then a grandparent, adult sibling, or adult aunt or uncle.""

You mentioned you have older siblings. If you could find a doctor willing to bend the rules slightly, they may be able to vaccinate you with a siblings consent. Its probably not going to work, and I can't advocate to you to do something that may get you in trouble, but again, better than Measels or Polio.",hwi9q3,2020-07-23 18:37:39
"You still may be able to! In the sleepover plan doesn't pan out, I would suggest researching Title X-funded clinics near you (ex: Planned Parenthood) and calling to find out what vaccines they have available and if they'd be willing to vaccinate you. You should be able to receive vaccines at little to no cost there, and Planned Parenthood should definitely have the HPV and Hepatitis B vaccines in stock.

Just in my lifetime have we actually advanced in the world and we're still lower-middle class-upper poor. My family has been so unlucky that my brother was almost shot in the head by a white cop because they thought he had a stolen car. They literally forced him onto his knees and held the barrel against his forehead, he was fucking terrified af. Luckily his partner ran his tags and realized it wasn't the stolen car they were looking for.

Yes, there are some cases where a vaccination went wrong and the kid had some problems but they are very very rare.

All vaccines are tested very well and are helping very much (see this graph for example:  [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death) ) In this graph you can see that the cases went down so much in the year 1964.

It is crazy that you dont find supporting evidence of vaccine damage/death or other side affects from vaccines that can affect the odd 1% of people (usually children/newborns). Its almost as if the pharmaceutical companies that make and sell the vaccines have also funded their own journals and ousted any claims or evidence that goes against their almost trillion dollar industry... like remember when cigarettes were all the rage even your doctors swore by them. And tge tobacco industry spent billions towards politicians and lobbyists to keep their products selling.

Its not a one size fits all. Thats what im trying to say. The fact its so hard to find data on that small percentage who do experience negative affects that get written off as something else or unrelated to the vaccine. ~1% of 9 billion is still 900 million people who could have adverse affects.

I imagine it's going to be down to the state governments as the federal response has been so disastrous and disorganised.

"The reason why unvaccinated children are as healthy as the vaccinated children is because of herd immunity. The disease is no longer present in out society because it isn't transmitted. What is very clear is that populations which have a lower vaccination rate are far far far more likely to have outbreaks of dangerous diseases, killing mainly the most vulnerable members of society children, older people and people with lowered immune systems. There is plenty of data to suggest the success of vaccines in lowering the disease rates. 

Whatever study I show you you are likely to dismiss as being ""big pharma"" so there's really no point, I mean if you can't find the easily accessible and widely published studies for yourself there's no hope. You can't see what you don't want to see, and you can't understand what you don't want to understand - this is called conformation bias. 

Yes there are also studies that indicate the rates of vaccine injury - these studies you have no problem in not just citing but exaggerating their findings. 

I am not personally in favour of forced vaccination, but I am in favour of education and critical thinking. Critical thinking means looking at the costs and risks and comparing them to the benefits and making a decision. Critical thinking doesn't mean blindly disagreeing with the government or local authority because ""freedom"" or whatever. If you study the trails, research and effects of vaccines you will only come to one conclusion they are vastly beneficial and have been crucial in eradicating diseases reducing infant mortality rate to the lowest it has ever been in the history of mankind and saving billions of $ in medical expenses.",hpc3yg,2020-07-12 10:29:07

evidence, research? peer reviewed RCTs showing, that vaccinated are healthier? anything, do u have anything? or just the believe, that because people got healthier over time, it MUST have been the vaccines and can't be oh i don't know... clean water, hygiene, sewage systems, etc....

we can however look at research together, come:

> The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines. 

what do we have here... a study showing, that the apertussis vaccine actually increases spread of the disease, rather than preventing or being neutral, it actually increases it by creating asymptomatic carriers. well, that sounds like research, that goes 100% against your believe, i wonder how u will respond to it...

and vaccines reduced mortality u say?

well....

linking the dtp vaccine to an increase in overall mortality

well no, i cam perfectly capable of going over most studies and making up my own mind.

i specifically asked for studies in my comment, yet u won't link them, why?

again what data? i specifically asked for RCTs for tetanus, as the one posting this picture clearly must have looked at the research.

 if u don't understand what a proper RCT is in this case:

>a double blind, inert-placebo controlled, randomized, longterm study using fully unvaccinated children as control groups looking at overall health outcome

 and of course looking at a tetanus vaccine in this case."" 

it shouldn't be so hard to get one proper specific safety study linked to me now?

should have taken u mere seconds and would have been way faster than write a long comment, but yet again no study linked...

in regards to how ""successful"" vaccines are i have one mroe study, that might interest u.

> The response to the reduction in OPV rounds (de-challenging) adds credence to the assumption that OPV was responsible for the change in the NPAFP rate. 

the polio vaccine madness in india caused 490000 paralyzed children. 490000 paralyzed children, not my opinion, but what the research says. NPAFP would have been called polio, if one uses the old polio definition.

so using the old polio definition one can say:

""polio vaccinations in india caused 490000 caes of polio"".

this is one example of recent vaccine ""success"", that u say is so great.

4 local high schools with 2,500+ students each, all attended these  parties, and no deaths for my class, my brothers class, my sisters class. Immunity is always the best vaccine for non life threatening infections, as many vaccinated and told they had lifetime immunity have not been so lucky.

This destroys your immunity to all sorts of bugs for ~5 years. How do you know that no one died from diseases that they otherwise would not have died from? 


>The risk associated with measles infection is much greater than the sum of its observable symptoms. The immune memories that you have acquired are priceless, built over many years and from countless exposures to a menagerie of germs. Measles virus is especially dangerous because it has the ability to destroy what‚Äôs been earned: immune memory from previous infections. Meanwhile, the process of fighting measles infection leaves patients especially vulnerable to secondary infection. The worldwide increase in measles prevalence is cause for concern because morbidity and mortality from the disease extends far beyond acute measles infection.... it may take up to 5 years for children to develop healthy immune systems even in the absence of the immune suppressing effects of MV infection. If MV infection essentially resets a child‚Äôs developing immunity to that of a newborn, re-vaccination or exposure to all previously encountered microbes will be required in order to rebuild proper immune function.

"Actually kind of true. In 1950, it only had a death count of 500 a year, in the US population of 260 million or so. I'm 1940 it was 600-700 a year, and 1930 it was 1000 a year.

That's 70-90 years ago.

Vaccine wasn't invented until 57 years ago.

Today, theoretically, without vaccines, considering population growth, and using pre existing data to extrapolate, we can predict about 50 deaths a year from measles in they USA today, that's without any vaccine.

The vaccine for measles has been reported to cause death 50 times last year. And a Harvard study showed that almost 100% of vaccine injuries go unreported. So, that number could be into the 1000s, easily.

Of course, we don't and can't know as there's no placebo studies done on vaccines.",hngbgs,2020-07-10 00:37:02

"No students had died a decade later, as My small town was tight knit and any deaths were known about within days via the local paper, there were no unusual deaths. 

Two to three days of discomfort of chick pox, mumps, and measles gave a lifetime immunity, yet the vaccine corporations advertise a 90% immunity, yet during this time it was doctors recommending the parties and overseeing the patients, hence the term ""practicing medicine"". 

In other cases of the vaccinated getting infections, the CDC notes the 1983 Illinois measles outbreak: 
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000359.htm

Note the CDC states the infection rate was 10 times higher for those that had been vaccinated 10 or more years prior to the outbreak, blowing the 90% lifetime immunity scheme out of the water. The patient A's close friend infection rate was at 21%, all of which had been vaccinated.

"It's paranoia and conspiracy theorists. Few anti-vaxxers come to their beliefs on their own; they are indoctrinated. Once they get sucked into the anti-vax cult, they have both their peers and the quacks they idolize telling them any information that doesn't support their views is lies and propaganda, which fosters an incredible closed-mindedness.

It's obvious to anyone outside the cult their views aren't rational, so it's no surprise it's founded on fear and emotion, which are inherently irrational. And it's people's fears and emotions they play on to draw people in.

There's two main types of anti-vaxxers that I've noticed: those who feel victimized in some way and find that the anti-vax movement gives them validation and a perpetrator to crusade against, and paranoid types who are easily swayed by conspiracy beliefs which validate their fears.

An example of the first type is Catie Clobes or whatever her name is (the one who keeps making Facebook posts from other people's babies ""thanking"" her for ""saving"" them from vaccines). She smothered her recently-vaccinated infant daughter by co-sleeping with her while drunk. The anti-vax cult got to her and convinced her that vaccines were the real cause of her death, and she bought into it, because now she had something to blame besides herself: Big Pharma.

Most anti-vaxxers don't have stories as tragic as hers (though I have no sympathy for her, given how virulently she's pushing her daughter's death as anti-vax propaganda), but many others have children with special needs. Parents who are resentful of the ""burden"" of caring for a special-needs child are particularly vulnerable to anti-vax indoctrination. They can't be angry at genetics because genetics is something impersonal they can't campaign against, but when they're told their child is ""vaccine injured"", now there's a culprit they can direct their anger at. (A side note, this is why the anti-vax community is so horribly ableist. Parents who are more support-focused and accepting of their kids' conditions/disabilities don't tend to become anti-vaxxers. It's the ones who are more focused on the burden *they* bear and lament over not having a ""normal"" child who do.)

Now, the other type are the conspiracy nutjobs. The above group believe the risks of vaccines outweigh the benefits and that the CDC/Big Pharma covers up side effects in order to protect their profits; the conspiracist group believes that vaccines are developed with malicious intent: to implant tracking/mind control chips, to sterilize certain groups as part of a eugenics program, you name it. These people aren't *just* anti-vaxxers; they tend to believe in a range of conspiracy theories. How people fall so deep into conspiracy beliefs baffles me, but it stems from paranoia and distrust of the government/authority (many conspiracy theories latch onto this fear). Tell a paranoid person that the government/some shadow organization that controls the government is using vaccines to implement some diabolical plan, and if they've already started down the slope of conspiracy theories, they'll readily believe it.

When the results of the Verstraeten study were first reported outside the CDC in 2005, there was no evidence that anyone but Dr. Verstraeten within the CDC had known of the very high 7.6-fold elevated relative risk of autism from exposure to Thimerosal during infancy. But now, clear evidence exists. A newly-acquired abstract from 1999 titled, ‚ÄúIncreased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to Thimerosal containing vaccine in first month of life‚Äù required the approval of top CDC officials prior to its presentation at the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) conference. Thimerosal, which is 50% mercury by weight, was used in most childhood vaccines and in the RhoGAM shot for pregnant women prior to the early 2000s.

The CDC maintains there is ‚Äúno relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism rates in children,‚Äù even though the data from the CDC‚Äôs own Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database shows a very high risk. There are a number of public records to back this up, including this Congressional Record from May 1, 2003.

The CDC‚Äôs refusal to acknowledge thimerosal‚Äôs risks is exemplified by a leaked statement from Dr. Marie McCormick, chair of the CDC/NIH-sponsored Immunization Safety Review at IOM. Regarding vaccination, she said in 2001, ‚Äú‚Ä¶we are not ever going to come down that it [autism] is a true side effect‚Ä¶‚Äù Also of note, the former director of the CDC, which purchases $4 billion worth of vaccines annually, is now president of Merck‚Äôs vaccine division.‚Äù  https://www.shiftfrequency.com/cdc-admits-thimerosal-causes-autism/",hn335x,2020-07-08 05:49:27

"Bro, you should really be more critical of where you het your information. The page tot posted is filled to the brim with outlandish conspiracy theories. Tinning the herd? Whats up with that.
Mercury is a natural occuring element in out body which is needed for some very specific enzymatic processes. Same goes for aluminium. The reading vaccins contained these elements was to aid the active ingredient of the vaccin in creating immunity. The amount of Mercury in vaccins was but a fraction of what occurs naturally in your body. Nevertheless, the removed thiomersal from vaccins a while a go, and a decrease of children born with autism has not been observed.

It is good to be critical of vaccins. Afterall, we use them on a large scale in children and older people. However, vaccins are complicated, science is complicated and a clear-cut awnser isnt always available. The only advice I can give is to never stop asking yourself 'why?'

"Serious adverse events, while possible, are very rare - and they tend to make the news precisely because they're so unusual. You may have read reports last year about two people who died after receiving the yellow fever vaccination. If you're considering getting the jab, this tragic news needs to be viewed in context.

According to the World Health Organization, serious side effects occur at a rate of around 0.09 to 0.4 cases per 10,000 doses of the yellow fever vaccine, in populations who haven't been exposed to the virus. By contrast, the serious form of yellow fever is fatal around half the time.

On a similar note, the rate of serious allergic reaction is around 1-2 cases per million across all vaccines. Compare that with the death rate for measles (around 1 in 500), and for flu (around 200 deaths in the UK every winter), and it's obvious which is riskier.

""What we need to understand are the risks and benefits - how many people are dying from yellow fever, how many people are dying from measles?"" says Martini. ""Clearly, adverse effects are tragic for the individual and the family but they are rare, and we need to balance this with the risks associated with that disease.""

**Myth:** *Thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines in 2003.*

**Fact:** *Thimerosal wasn‚Äôt so much removed as it was moved around.*

Here‚Äôs how it worked: In 1999, after realizing that the cumulative  amount of mercury a child was exposed to via vaccines had never been  tallied, [the Public Health Service (PHS), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and vaccine manufacturers‚Äô ](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4826a3.htm)recommended  Thimerosal be removal from all childhood vaccines. Thimerosal was then  in three childhood vaccines: against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus  (DTaP), against Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and against  hepatitis B.

However, instead of r*equiring* immediate removal, the CDC  allowed the pharmaceutical companies to save money by using up their  inventories of mercury-containing vaccines.

By 2003, the industry had finally used up stocks of  thimerosal-containing vaccines and Thimerosal is no longer used in these  three vaccines.

At the same time mercury was finally phased out of the DTaP, Hib and  Hep B vaccine, the CDC added the mercury-containing flu vaccine to the  childhood schedule.

At that time, almost all flu vaccines contained 25 micrograms (mcgs) of mercury, recommended to children in every year of life.

**Myth:** *If the CDC still allows Thimerosal in vaccines given to pregnant women, then it must be safe.*

**Fact:** *NO amount of mercury is safe for humans. Thimerosal-containing vaccines are especially unsafe for pregnant women.*

Mercury is one of the most toxic substances known to man. Studies have also shown that thimerosal causes [debilitating brain injuries and miscarriages](http://www.aapsonline.org/vaccines/cathimerosal.pdf)  when pregnant women have been exposed to mercury (methyl and ethyl)  from accidental poisonings. The FDA has never tested or approved  thimerosal for use in pregnancy.",hn335x,2020-07-08 18:39:49

No, doctors are not paid by pharmaceutical companies to give vaccinations. Their only incentive to recommend vaccination is to keep your child healthy and protected from serious diseases.

The Vit K shot is given to prevent, among other things, brain bleeds. Some who are hesitant about vaccines can still be talked into a delayed vaccine schedule, and, while this is not ideal, at least your baby will be vaccinated eventually. The Vit K shot is different. It is given solely to newborns to help them survive those first few days. There is no ‚Äúthe baby might get sick‚Äù with this one.  If your baby gets a brain bleed, you‚Äôre looking at long term brain damage as the best case scenario. If you lose all other battles, do not lose this one!!",hm5xeu,2020-07-07 00:59:51

It is best if your wife is on board but it is absolutely not necessary. You have every right legal and otherwise, to be the one to take your child down to the pediatrician and have them vaccinated.

I have no advice on how to educate her or change her mind. You know your wife, we don't. My guess is she's more afraid of her mom's disapproval and she is the potential dangers of being on vaccinated. To be honest, her mom actually exists for her. She is a very real force in her life. Most of the diseases we get vaccinated against seem so distant, extinct, ironically because of vaccines. But it gives people like your wife a false sense of security. There are still some cases of these diseases, maybe you need to find a way to expose your wife to those so that she can see what very real injuries there can be from not being vaccinated",hm5xeu,2020-07-06 17:24:06

Now that I have got that out of the way and you are looking for a way forward I suggest you go to NVIC.org, a vaccine safety activist website and check out the page titled ask8

https://www.nvic.org/Ask-Eight-Questions.aspx

Contrary to what you may have heard, vaccine safety activists do vaccinate their children. Their is a wide variety of positions within the vaccine safety community regarding vaccination from no vaccines to delayed or modified vaccination practices.

Sure a few hundred or so people may have been affected but that‚Äôs why people strive to improve them, you‚Äôre just highlighting the part of the population that they also want to help out. It‚Äôs better than getting polio or mumps which can affect someone until they die either by incapacitating them via backlash or stunting the family tree via side effects that can be easily prevented. What do you say to your kid when they can‚Äôt have kids of their own because you didn‚Äôt vaccinate them against mumps? Do you say sorry? Or do you say you thought your home cooked food would do the trick and cure you from everything? Not even mentioning that Autism and mental issues can be the result of genetic mutation, which can run in families just as eye color does. My own family is immunocompromised everywhere and it‚Äôs not due to vaccines, it‚Äôs due to pollution and many other factors that can‚Äôt be improved. My family has a line of cancer cells that, on a dime, could turn cancerous and stop being benign. My mom has gone through several doctor visits to check out a cancerous growth in her armpit and my uncle died of pneumonia after surviving childhood leukemia, we literally relied on people being immunized to see him recover and guess what? He didn‚Äôt because he caught pneumonia. Are you saying that just because a few people get harmed by something that is constantly being improved to stop harming people is such a bad thing when it prevents so many deaths every year? Why do you think so many diseases and sicknesses have been eradicated until your parents said ‚Äúfuck it!

"Are they really 'striving to improve them?""
did you know :  Thimerosal wasn't removed , it was moved from one vaccine to another?  
""Here‚Äôs how it worked: In 1999, after realizing that the cumulative amount of mercury a child was exposed to via vaccines had never been tallied, the Public Health Service (PHS), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and vaccine manufacturers‚Äô recommended Thimerosal be removal from all childhood vaccines. Thimerosal was then in three childhood vaccines: against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DTaP), against Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and against hepatitis B.

However, instead of requiring immediate removal, the CDC allowed the pharmaceutical companies to save money by using up their inventories of mercury-containing vaccines.

By 2003, the industry had finally used up stocks of thimerosal-containing vaccines and Thimerosal is no longer used in these three vaccines.

At the same time mercury was finally phased out of the DTaP, Hib and Hep B vaccine, the CDC added the mercury-containing flu vaccine to the childhood schedule.

At that time, almost all flu vaccines contained 25 micrograms (mcgs) of mercury, recommended to children in every year of life.""https://childrenshealthdefense.org/what-we-do/mercury-is-not-safe-in-any-form-debunking-the-myths-about-thimerosal-safety/





I have nothing against the idea of vaccines and introducing a little bit of a virus to help build the immunity if that is in fact what the science says what we should do.  

let's just take out the toxic elements and find a better way. that's all i'm saying",hlkaz4,2020-07-07 02:30:40
"Maybe you should stop deleting comments to make yourself look good, besides, if you had a stock of things that could prevent something that kills would you use it all? Or waste even more money buying something else and let the rest of that go to waste? Do you know how much chemicals of that nature cost? These researchers are funded by a few programs but not by the government as you guys adamantly shove, they don‚Äôt have cash for days like many films make you believe. Being this adamant that vaccines do more harm than good is just childish at this point, children dislike vaccines because it hurts but when you‚Äôre an adult you can think about how many things are being prevented with this one poke. Do you know about the Black Death? It‚Äôs still not eradicated because the virus itself is just like the flu, constantly updating and upgrading itself. How would you counter that? By using something that requires even more research and time that could cost thousands of lives or use something that has proven to work even with a few short comings such as the ones you‚Äôre stating?",hlkaz4,2020-07-07 02:36:22

I did. First website that came up is:
https://www.healmindbody.com/knowledges/5g-wi-fi-and-emf-damaging-effects-on-the-body/


First thing presented is a quote from Professor Martin L. Pall. He has spent the last 8 years writing scary lectures on EMF and has yet to present any of his findings to any credible scientific board.

Second, ""Wuhan, China was the first to roll out 5G."" Blantently false as ALL OF SOUTH KOREA was the first back in April 2019.

Third, just says research suggests 5G weakens the immune system without offering the source of the research.

They continue to compare this to the tobacco company as if they can compare apples and oranges.

They then try to scare you by showing you a picture of a cell tower and show your coverage.


These people are afraid of millimeter wavelength radios but the truth is, that wavelength of light cannot pierce your skin, it bounces right off of you. If you stand in front of an antenna for an extended period of time, you'll get a burn from heat, not from mutating ionizing radiation. From my days climbing towers to service this equipment, I can tell you that it feels like a sunburn. Believe it or not, there are plenty of licenses in use for millimeter wave radios now. They are used for backhauls to transmit gigabits of data per second within a network. The reason these are so high on towers now isn't a safety thing, a leaf can ruin the signal if it gets on the way because these signal are so weak.",hk3gie,2020-07-03 01:27:49

"not sure why its my responsibilty to teach you this, I thought it was common knowledge, but anyway:

""Cells control the flow of specific charged elements across the membrane with proteins that sit on the cell surface and create an opening for certain ions to pass through. These proteins are called ion channels. When a cell is stimulated, it allows positive charges to enter the cell through open ion channels. The inside of the cell then becomes more positively charged, which triggers further electrical currents that can turn into electrical pulses, called action potentials. Our bodies use certain patterns of action potentials to initiate the correct movements, thoughts and behaviors.

**A disruption in electrical currents can lead to illness.**""

 Whatever its toll in industrialized countries, where the measles fatality rate is 1 per 10,000 cases (Babbott and Gordon, 1954),   .... 

with overall better health and proper treatment like giving vitamin a the number would of course be way lower than that.

what is the death rate from the measles vaccines? well mmr vaccine, as they deliberately removed the single measles vaccine? well no one knows, because no longterm randomized controlled trials were done for the vaccines.

on top of that, u got studies, that shows, that childhood infectious diseases result in a better longterm health in regards to heart disease and cancer.

so does getting measles have a net positive in a first world country in regards to preventing death?  probably.

https://virologydownunder.com/but-40000-cases-of-afp-in-india-must-mean-polio-is-thriving-right-no/",hix9jh,2020-07-01 08:12:44
"Ok let me clear that up. Vaccines are of two types killed and live. Live ones are better for herd immunity as one vaccinated child will spread that strain and effectively spread immunity. Making a live vaccine takes a process of serial culturing it till it looses it's property to cause polio disease and the example of India is because of lack of checking by authorities and bad testing by dumb companies that just want the money. So yes there is risk but these are low cost vaccines ordered by government and its these money hungry people that skip a few steps to make it cost effective. So people prefer a bit more expensive one from private hospitals who do things right not cheap.

Now live polio vaccines are a part of a plan to eliminate polio in places where polio was prevalent once. We have already stopped using polio 2 strain because it's not found anymore (we eradicated it because of vaccine, we also eradicated WPV 3 like 2 but it's still used in vaccines in some places). But if you live in US then live vaccine use has stopped there and they have shifted to killed only which doesn't have virus or herd immunity properties, it's just viral proteins and only likely problem would be an allergy to the protein or some chemical used as preservative. For explaination it is a part of a plan where you eventually shift to killed vaccines so you can eliminate polio entirely. So if a group of people stop taking these vaccines and god forbid polio becomes an epidemic, US will have to retract back to live vaccines too and that would be a big blow back in terms of medical progress towards eradication of polio like small pox.

In conclusion the information you have and it's interpretation are very different. A few google searches and well texted misinforming articles should not be your source of information, you should consult your family doctor or any local doctor. I am sure all lines of specialists will be able to explain you this. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me (I am a doctor but I would say don't trust internet on these matters just physically meet a doc or call one.)",hix9jh,2020-07-01 16:27:32

There is no evidence that vaccines are harmful. The exact opposite was proven. Psychologically, humans search for patterns in events that are purely chaotic.

"The problem with screeds like this is that it ignores how difficult it is developing and test vaccines. 'Vaccines always good' is just as ignorant as 'vaccines always bad'. We are going to be faced with some very difficult public health decisions if and when a rapidly developed vaccine becomes available for mass use. Saying things like 'the disease is always worse than the vaccine', is not true and it is setting us up for a very unscientific political environment to make decisions, either collectively or individually. Consider the case of Dengvaxia¬Æ in the Philippians. While this vaccine did provide protect to most recipients, The vaccine increased disease severity in some recipients. Dengvaxia¬Æ is now not recommended for individuals who are seronegative. The immune response to COVID19 is not well understood. Clear headed thinking will need to be applied as to who and how and under what terms a new vaccine should be used. Starting to shout now through a megaphone that anyone who even questions the safety of an as yet undeveloped vaccine is a moronic Luddite who threatens public health, is not helpful.

Yep! It seems that the best course of action right now is to only use the vaccine on those who would die anyway (even a small increase in survival rate) and perfect the vaccine as much as possible for everyone else.,hgzckl,2020-06-29 08:20:32

"I'm pro-vaccine, but to be honest I have seen more anti-science attitude from the pro-vaxxers on reddit than from the antivaxers, most of the antivaxers at least make some attempt to try to cite studies and data that they think support not vaccinating, it's more bad info and confirmation bias that it is anti-science

I have seen an odd attitude among many (not all) Reddit pro-vaxxers where they assume that just because they have heard that vaccines are good vaccines must be perfectly safe and that any study that suggests any safety issue with any vaccine must be fake because vaccines are by definition perfect and every vaccine preventable disease must be super deadly and that any source that dissagrees must be wrong

So tbh I agree with him that reddit has ""anti-science faith based vaccine zealots"" but ironically the user who made this comment is a particularly extreme antivaxer (I was in the thread where this was commented) who is probably guilty of similar zealotry",hfy32w,2020-06-26 03:16:22

The discovery and increase in the reported prevalence of autism parallels the introduction and spread of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Autism was first described in 1943 among children born in the 1930s.


 Thimerosal was also an ingredient in vaginal contraceptive creams and in over-the-counter products like merthiolate and contact lenses solution during the 1950s through the 1980s when its use was initially questioned by the FDA. 


In 1989 with the introduction a new vaccine for Haemophilus influenza B, exposure levels to mercury doubled in products that were universally recommended for all infants and children, vaccines. 

This is the year that has been identified by researchers as the ‚Äúchange point‚Äù year when the incidence of autism began to skyrocket. Thimerosal was first added to childhood vaccines in the 1930s.


Since 2000, the medical literature has been flush with cumulative research supporting a causal role for mercury in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders. Such studies have documented associations between environmental exposure to mercury and autism spectrum disorders


This document includes the abstracts for over 80 studies that provide mounting evidence linking exposure to mercury, at critical moments in development, to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. These include cellular, animal and human studies.

ABSTRACT:  .............""Results  obtain  on  the present  study showed that  thiomerosal,  H1N1  antigen  andH1N1  vaccine  were caused significant decrease in norepinephrine (NE) anddopamine (DA)  contents  of  hypothalamus, striatum and cerebral  cortex.  

The  alternation  in  NE  and  DA  was  associated with  significant  increase  in  oxidative markers namely  lipid peroxidation  and nitric  oxide,  oxidation  induction  was  extent  to  cause  significant decrease  in glutathione  level.  

In  conclusion,  the  present  study  demonstrated  that  H1N1  vaccine  as  a  whole  and/or  itsingredient  causedoxidative stress and monoamines alternations in brain of mice. The present observation could be due to the presence of thiomerosal.""",hec7wt,2020-06-24 04:13:50

"Fact: Thimerosal has not been removed from childhood vaccines.

In 2001 the Institute of Medicine reviewed the use of thimerosal containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders and recommended that thimerosal be removed from vaccines administered to sensitive populations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) chose not to follow the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine.

Today Thimerosal is still in approximately one third to one half of the flu vaccines produced annually and administered to pregnant women and infants (access the government‚Äôs list of Thimerosal-containing flu vaccines). This means that the developing fetus, as well as babies as young as six months, are being exposed to mercury in vaccines.

There is also Thimerosal in the diphtheria-tetanus vaccine and in one vaccine to protect against meningitis (access the government‚Äôs list of vaccine ingredients)

The CDC recommends flu shots for pregnant women, six-month olds, and children in every year of life. Pregnant women often instructed by their doctors to get two influenza vaccines if their pregnancy spans more than one flu season.

"This is the kind of bs that infuriates me... 
1. Chicken pox vaccine makes the risk factor for shingles much lower then if you head chicken pox as a kid.
2. The fact that OP's oldest potentially had a vaccine injury and would be at risk for worse should be MORE of a reason to vaccinate the other kids so that they don't bring home vaccine preventable diseases.
3. Kids get ear infections. They're messy af, and if your kid is getting ear infections like that, it's up to an audiologist to tell you whether it was from vaccines or if it's something else that needs to be improved on in his life, or if he's just more susceptible to them, and any doctor even remotely worth the time would put in a referral.
4. This is just the kind of anti-vaxx propaganda that's utter bs and is specifically designed to make pro vaxxers out to be devil's. Just about every pro vaxxer recognizes and knows there's always the chance that a child is genuinely hurt by vaccines. But we also recognize that that's even more of a reason to push kids and adults who are able to get vaccinated to do so.

"Oh yeah, to address the shingles bit, shingles is a disease that typically shows up in people starting around their 50's or older. Now, younger people can get it, but that's not nearly as common. I should also point out, it is the live chicken pox virus that causes it, and if you get it as a kid, you are much more susceptible to shingles as an adult. Soooo, let's do the math here folks, you take generations where most well meaning parents grew up believing that letting their kids get the chicken pox as kids would be better for them long run because the effects and symptoms as adults was worse, add the fact that the chicken pox vaccine wasn't available until 1995 in the us. Logically speaking, this was 25 years ago. Now then, the youngest person in the age group that is most susceptible to it would have been 25 at the time, and not needed the vaccine assuming they had chicken pox as a child, so, it is safe to assume most young adults at that time didn't get the vaccine either if they had it as a child. Using logic, common fucking sense, and adding all of this up, along with the fact most people between 50-85 have had shingles at least once, it would go to show, there is very little, if any link to the vaccine causing shingles, and just about all the evidence proving the lack of vaccine would be more likely the cause, however, those are statistics that are hard to gather because most people that have had the vaccine don't fall into the age category yet to where they would be more likely to contact shingles, thus the data doesn't actually exist as a repeatable result, so someone tell this bitch to stfu and try to make this argument again in about 25 more years when more people my age that had the vaccine are ACTUALLY at the age where they are more likely to get it because so far, most younger people that I've seen get shingles, they had chicken pox as a kid.",hdqgqm,2020-06-23 11:48:01
