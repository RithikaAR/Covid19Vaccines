Update- One month out fro second Pfizer.,118,nqmgv2,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nqmgv2/update_one_month_out_fro_second_pfizer/,48,"My previous post(s): https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nd3144/33f_2nd_pfizer_dose_second_update/

It’s been a month since I got my second dose of Pfizer and, unfortunately, I’m still not better.  My husband took a week off of work to stay with me but couldn’t take any more, so now I’m staying with my parents for the time being until I’m comfortable being alone again.  Symptoms that I still have are:

-Chronic chest & middle back pain with occasional shortness of breath

-Random shooting/burning pains in my mid & upper back

-Limbs tingling/feeling of half-numbness

-Palpitations and heart pounding, high heart rate

-Poor sleep

-Brain fog and poor vision

I went to the cardiologist and wore a 5 day holter monitor and am waiting for them to call me back with any results.  Normally, trying to sleep is the worst and I usually get worsening chest pain/pounding heart when trying to sleep and then I can’t sleep.  I’ve been taking Turmeric, Fish Oil, Magnesium daily and Ibuprofen as needed and I feel like its helped a little.

I know recently there have been a lot of posts hOw Do YoU kNoW tHeSe PeOpLe ArEn’T LiArS but I’m just telling my story. And hoping people who feel the same don’t feel alone.  I’ve chatted privately with a couple of people on here and it helps to feel like you aren’t alone in your misery.  So this post is for the people who need to hear that they aren’t the only ones suffering, they aren’t going crazy.

My cardiologist says give it a few more weeks to heal and I’m just dying to go back to normal.  Praying for good health for you all!",1622671249.0,2021-06-02 15:00:49

I got my 2nd Pfizer shot just over 3 weeks ago.

3+ weeks out,8,nr4cb0,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nr4cb0/3_weeks_out/,1," I did not really want to get this shot at all as I knew people who had been hospitalized post-vaccination and had major concerns about the adverse effects both the known and not known. I also had many of my own plans for prevention of severe covid that seemed  less risky (vitamin d!) but I took the shot mostly for social reasons- with some hope for antibodies.

Beforehand I took a lot of herbs and supplements to prepare for the various adverse effects  I was most concerned about including thrombosis, brain fog, neurological issues, respiratory issues, headache, gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular issues, pain and anxiety  (feel free to ask if you’re interested what I took if you’re  interested.)
Immediately after getting the shot my arm/wrist  felt a little numb  which was nerve-racking but went away. Instead of resting my first reaction when I got home was to walk and walk to avoid any stagnation in my body. I walked a lot. For the first few hours post-vax I felt great which I think was mostly relief to have gotten it over with as well as an effect of the herbs I took and possibly something about the shot itself.

Before bed I felt some nausea and heaviness in my legs. At three in the morning almost exactly 12 hours after I got my shot I woke up with a fever. It started just around 99.2 or so- then got to around 101- where it stayed for about 24 hours before turning into a low-grade intermittent fever the next day.
I didn’t mind the fever too much  but the bodyaches were unpleasant and I couldn’t have worked with them. For me the body aches mostly manifested in my hips and my legs and they hurt a fair amount . I alternated between the bath and my  bed throughout the day and took herbs and ate soup.

By the next day the fever was mostly gone and the bodyaches had lessened  there was still pain and tension.  I got repeated acupuncture treatments in the week to follow to support my body through the lingering pain- the acupuncture helped a lot. 

In the three or so weeks since the shot so far my worst fears have not come true. I did, however, notice a few things that may or may not be related. I had swelling in my foot which is something I have noticed with patients of mine after their shots. A few days after my shot I had loose stools for a couple days. Also about 5 days after the shot I had an unexpected menstrual cycle and some rough mood stuff.  I didn’t have any obvious respiratory issues, thrombosis, brain fog, headaches, neurological issues or cardiovascular issues which was a relief.",1622721567.0,2021-06-03 04:59:27

I got my first Moderna shot in the end of January and my second exactly 28 days later in February.  

First dose had a slightly sore arm.  Second dose I had a super minor fever (100.3) for like an hour and just felt tired for an hour or two.  Honestly, I probably wouldn’t have had noticed my fever had I not been a nerd about this stuff and taken my temperature regularly post vaccination.

But yeah, it went great.  Lol, I was excited to have a little bit of side effects, since you really know the immune response is working.

I signed up 90+ coworkers for vaccine appointments (back when it was hard to get appointments).  I’m in charge of our COVID program, so I’m also tracking when people are out sick, and very few people stayed out because of vaccine side effects",1622706267.0,2021-06-03 00:44:27

Workplace mask free if vaccinated question.,18,nqzple,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nqzple/workplace_mask_free_if_vaccinated_question/,33,"I’m currently working at a retail store that announced masks would be option for those who have been vaccinated. I (21F) have not been vaccinated yet due to a few reasons. I had test confirmed Covid July of last year. Positive for antibodies as well. I barely had any symptoms, no fever just a stuffy nose like a head cold. I’m generally pretty nervous about this vaccine in particular. I’ve had every other vaccine required and recommended, but the constant political discourse about it makes me nervous. Likewise, I have had Covid and have antibodies, so I guess I feel like I’m pretty safe from getting it + spreading it to others. 

Which leads me to my question. My workplace specified that it’s only if you’ve had the vaccine, but I’m wondering if it would make sense for me to bring up the fact that I’ve had and survived Covid. From what I understand, having Covid gives you and even better immunity than the vaccine. So, would this make sense, or should I get over it and try to get the vaccine?",1622706174.0,2021-06-03 00:42:54

Got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and my menstrual cycle has been unusual. Anyone else?,29,nqs0ae,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nqs0ae/got_the_pfizer_covid19_vaccine_and_my_menstrual/,36,"Hi everyone! I've had some irregularities with my menstrual cycle since I received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and was wondering if anyone else has experienced the same. 

On April 3rd, I (F23) had my expected period. On April 11th, I received my first dose. Besides soreness at the site of injection (literally could not lift my arm for 2 days) and fatigue, it was pretty normal. Over a week later on April 23rd, I unexpectedly got a sudden and heavier period that lasted for about 4 days. I did not get my expected period the first week of May. I received my second dose on May 9th and the following day felt very fatigued and had a headache, but no other symptoms. Felt back to normal soon. However, it is June 2nd and I still haven't gotten a period.

To reiterate,

* 4/3 - Period
* 4/11 - First Pfizer Dose (symptoms: fatigue 1st day, arm soreness until 3 days after)
* 4/23  - Unexpected period
* 5/9 - Second Pfizer Dose (symptoms: very fatigued and headache day after)
* No period since then

I do have a gynecologist's appointment this month and I am planning to take a pregnancy test later today once I get my hands on one.

Does anyone else feel stressed that they have the “shitty” vaccine?,16,nqs2s4,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nqs2s4/does_anyone_else_feel_stressed_that_they_have_the/,17,"Idk where else to post this so I hope this is OK.

I got my J&amp;J shot a couple of days before the blood clot stuff came out/they paused injections. I followed the guidance that “the best shot is the one you can get in your arm” and happily took the J&amp;J, but as more variants come out and states are basically rejecting the J&amp;J vaccine in favor of the RNA vaccines, I’m starting to feel way less protected than those who got the 2 dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

I know a lot of this comes down to perception, but it feels like every article that comes out is about how J&amp;J prevents “severe” COVID. I’m young, I’m not worried about dying, I’m worried about the potential long term/lifelong health impacts of long COVID. 8 players on the Yankees contracted COVID after being vaccinated with J&amp;J, and one of them had already had COVID this year! That seems really alarming. Are we going to need to be revaccinated? Booster shots? I’m finding the lack of solid info/decision making from the top really frustrating. The world is “reopening” and I don’t feel like it’s safe for me to join until this gets resolved.

I know there’s not much to be done about this/none of us can go back in time but it’s been really stressing me out. I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same or had any insight.

I used to have heartburn and acid reflux issues on a regular basis. It actually became more recurrent during the pandemic because my eating habits went to hell. I'm still working on straightening myself out about this, but I'm still not eating as healthy as I used to. I've had some light food sensitivities for a few years now, and they become exacerbated and end up giving me heartburn when I tend to not eat as healthy. 

My personal diet hasn't changed since I received both vaccines, but...I have not had a single heartburn issue since the 2nd vaccine shot. I'm not saying it's because of the vaccine, but it seems to align perfectly with the 2nd shot.

Pfizer 2 Weeks Out,29,nqiw3t,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nqiw3t/pfizer_2_weeks_out/,4,I had a positive experience with the vaccine and I want to add more signal to the noise.  I’m 2 weeks out from dose 2 and I have had no major symptoms.  After the first dose I felt tired for a day then it was life as usual.  After the second dose I felt each joint in my body one at a time over about 12 hours after 12 hours from the shot.  Each joint had a soreness that came and went and systematically passed through every joint.  I am fortunate to not have any pre-existing conditions so this experience was relatively uneventful.  I truly feel for all those that have had a reaction because the lack of warning for some folks is really a bummer.  However if there are those holding out for good news I am here to say that it is likely that you will come out the other side unaffected and ready to live life to the fullest.  Hope this inspires at least one person to get the shot.  Thanks for being here Reddit.  This sub was truly helpful for me.,1622659317.0,2021-06-02 11:41:57
Which vaccine is best for me? My family has gotten both Moderna and Pfizer with absolutely no reactions,2,nr1gqq,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nr1gqq/which_vaccine_is_best_for_me_my_family_has_gotten/,8,"(21 F, Ohio) I’m really nervous about the vaccine. I haven’t gotten it yet because I have a lot of anxiety around needles and shots. Any time I’ve had to get vaccines, flu shots, blood work, or go to the dentist I cry and work myself up over the needles. It stresses me out so much I put a lot of this stuff off. I’ve been procrastinating getting the vaccine for this reason. I know it’s dramatic and childish and I feel stupid for it. I wanna face my fear and just get it done with though. I am also mildly worried about side effects and feeling unwell afterwards. My mom received both shots of her Moderna vaccine, and she had absolutely no side effects except for a sore arm. My sister received both shots of her Pfizer vaccine and also had no side effects except for a sore arm. Considering that my family has had no side effects to the vaccine, would it be safe to say I may not either? I was considering going with the J&J because it’s just the one shot and done (which would be nice bc of my fear of needles) and it supposedly has lesser side effects. Or should I get Pfizer or Moderna since my family got that and had no problems?",1622711859.0,2021-06-03 02:17:39
Most people who have a normal/positive Covid-19 vaccine experience don’t run to Reddit to tell the Redditors all about it,388,nq3x89,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nq3x89/most_people_who_have_a_normalpositive_covid19/,171,"More than 1 billion people on our planet have gotten the vaccine. The vast majority of us, are fine after it. Most of them just don’t use Reddit/ don’t see it as important news to tell everyone about it. And many (note; not all) stories of people not being fine after the vaccine aren’t proven to be tied to the vaccine at all. I mean, I’ve seen this post on a vaccine-sceptic forum saying “oh no 13% of pregnant women in the vaccine trials have had a miscarriage, the vaccine is making these women infertile panic panic panic”, meanwhile 10-20% of all pregnancies end in a miscarriage. Vaccine or no vaccine.

I (20F, no AI disorders or any health issues, slightly underweight BMI but practically never get sick. Idk if this info is important but just in case) got my Pfizer vaccine the 6th of May, and had 0 side effects from it except from a slightly sore arm for 1,5 day. My period came right on time, not heavy or painful or anything different from usual. (I’ve read some reports of women having cycle issues after the shot). My next shot is in 10 days. 

My mom (52F, blood pressure issues and meds), got the Astrazeneca first dose 3 weeks ago, and she experienced slight fever in the night and a sore arm. 
Nothing serious or lingering.

Some of my peers and many of my moms peers have gotten it as well, and are also doing just fine with no serious side effects.

I see lots of horror stories being shared, and the negative experiences need to be shared as well so that people can weigh the pros, cons, and the risks. But we also shouldn’t forget that most people who had the vaccine and had a neutral/normal experience won’t tell Reddit all about it and just go on with their lives as usual. And that correlation doesn’t equal causation.

It’s the first time in history that millions, even a billion of people are getting vaccinated with the same vaccine around the same time. Ofcourse we’re going to hear many “bad side effects” stories, because of that fact. But it would’ve been the same with any other vaccine. Plus, don’t forget that now, because of “vaccine paranoia”, and the vaccine being brand new, people will write many unrelated things off to the vaccine. Like “oh I’m having a headache after the vaccine”, meanwhile they’d probably have a headache either way because they’re not drinking enough water/not sleeping well. 

And I understand that people want transparency and the negative experiences as well, but don’t forget that the positive experiences are the silent majority.

I’m just worried that it can cause cancer down the road since a lot of early gene therapy vaccines caused leukemia.

2. Dose 17th of May: 1.30pm
Less arm pain than after first dose. In the evening around 10 pm I felt really tired. I woke up at 3am with an achy body. No temperature. Next day, I slept a lot and my whole body was hurting. Was able to watch some TV though. Body ache was gone the day after. Headache stayed for another few hours.


Between the first and the second dose I had some days with migraine and also the week after dose two, I had a whole weekend with an uncomfortable migraine. I dont know if there is a correlation with the vaccine or if it was because of the weather/Stress/ etc. I do normally have migraines sometimes, but that was quite frequently, so I thought I write it down.

I got my 2nd dose 1 month later and am still having \*minor\* side effects, it doesn't really bother me anymore though. If anything it was a good thing because it made me fix my sleep schedule. Anyways, on my 2nd dose I didn't feel anything for the 1st day at all, but on my 2nd day I got really bad headaches, my chest was in so much pain and felt like I was gonna pass out sometimes (I have major anxiety about things like heart attacks so my brain thought the worst whenever it'd hurt) and i was always drowsy. I also had this feeling of wanting to vomit when I ate food, so I ate light that day. I'm on my 3rd day now, and I can say that after getting a good rest (which usually I don't get very often, because I have a hard time sleeping in general) I have minor headaches that kinda come in and out, they dont really hurt it's just annoying, and I am still tired a lot, but it's more of a relaxed sorta tired instead of wanting to fall asleep tired. I'm gonna assume this will go away soon since most of the other feelings I had are basically gone already.

Overall i'd say mine wasn't a perfect experience like some people who feel no different before or after, but it wasn't really bad either, so i'd consider it pretty good. I just lied in bed for a day watching Youtube, and now i'm ok to actually start going outside again. My anxiety about going outside after getting the vaccine is so much better too.

Strep and rapid COVID test negative. PCR should be back tomorrow, I have to quarantine until then (longer if it’s positive) because of my symptoms. The urgent care doctor said she has seen two COVID positive patients who are vaccinated and both never had COVID prior.

My 1st dose Pfizer timeline,2,nqli3d,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nqli3d/my_1st_dose_pfizer_timeline/,0,"Female, early 40's, white, never had covid before that I know of, don't drink, smoke, or anything. No kids. History of migraines, gastritis (inflamed stomach). Overweight but not significantly.  May be going through perimenopause but not diagnosed officially. Live in Canada.

Sunday 1:40 - got 1st dose, the needle itself hurt way less than I anticipated it would based on experiences with other vaccines. A blood draw hurts a bit more for reference.

I was told to move my arm around so I kept moving it doing little minor arm exercises just to encourage blood flow I suppose. I want to say here, I did NOT overdo it, we are talking periodic little circles in the air with my arm, not lifting at the gym.I feel great, fine. Really no pain anywhere. 

Sunday 4pm - arm feels stiff, like, moving it hurts a little. I try to do my air arm circles and the pain from movement begins to really inhibit me. 

Sunday 7pm - about now I began to experience severe arm pain, 9/10 pain, only things worse were a broken bone and a serious health issue I had that required emergency surgery.  Took 2 Tylenol to no avail. I had basically no range of motion in arm, I can't move it from my side, curled up like a little T-Rex. Any amount of jiggling from me switching positions or walking would flare up the pain enough to make me cry out. At one point I just laid in bed sobbing. An advil later also proved useless. 

Sunday 12am: try to get comfortable in bed, only position that works is on my back. A thin blanket was enough 'weight' on my arm to cause a yelp. 

Monday 5am: woke up too early, can't sleep properly due to pain. 

Monday 8am: I have a low grade fever (37.6) and some back aching (5/10 pain). Fever does not bother me. Just the arm bothers me. 

Monday 4pm: Back pain is more like 6 or 7 now but definitely nowhere close to arm pain still. Fever goes up to 38.1 but does not cause too much distress. The fan in my direction is enough to take away the discomfort. No chills or much sweating. I now have weird shooting pains that go up my shoulder and to my collarbone or neck. My heart feels fast but not dangerously so.

Tuesday: I still have a low grade fever, it will go up to only 37.6 or so still, and sometimes go to normal. It comes and goes in little waves. Again fever is not high enough to bother me at all. Back aching has stopped. My arm no longer hurts when I move around and I can hold it down straight against my side without pain. I can't raise it parallel to the ground or up like I'm asking a question in school. Too much pain and stiffness. 

Wednesday: It's still the morning here. Arm pain much more bearable, but still cannot use it the way I did before. Range is still not all the way better, a lot of pain in certain positions. Zero pain if I move it into a comfortable position. Based on the way it's gone so far I expect to have a working arm again by this weekend, but not fully functional until then. 

In some ways this went better than I thought. I expected a migraine because I get them very easily. I got no headache at all. I expected nausea because I have a sensitive tummy, but I was also 100% fine there. Good appetite too. 

The arm pain, though, was worse than anyone ever indicated. I was not adequately warned. No one said it would be one of the worst pain experiences of my life. I sometimes think that I will have to get this again in August or September and then every year from now on and I don't know how I can do this. Especially when they said the first one is not supposed to be that bad at all. The only way 2nd can be worse is if my arm shrivels up and falls off. Or maybe catches on fire, and stays on fire, for a week. 

Wish my news was better but they can't all be great. In my family I was the only one who had this bad a time, if that helps. My husband had no problems at all.",1622668394.0,2021-06-02 14:13:14

I’m someone who has an autoimmune disease and am on biologics, so I’m also considered immune compromised/suppressed.

I was somewhat against getting the vaccine for myself for the longest while: not enough research (in my opinion) and I’d already had COVID so I had some degree of natural immunity.

I eventually decided I should get the vaccine. I wish I could tell you I felt 100% I was doing the right thing, but I didn’t. I still felt there wasn’t enough research and some of the reported side effects scared the heck out of me.

May 6 was my first dose. Side effects: Very sore arm. Tiredness (I’m always tired, though, so correlation is inconclusive). I have a history of arrhythmia, and I swear I noticed some palpitations after my first dose within the following weeks. Hadn’t had any in quite some time before that (again, correlation is inconclusive). Some minor digestive issues (again, inconclusive).

May 27, second dose. Side effects: Arm slightly sore but way better than last. Virtually no side effects so far and I hope it remains as such.

Just wanted to share an experience that wasn’t a horror story. Getting the vaccine is a very personal decision, so I don’t want to sway anyone in either direction—just providing a neutral experience.",1622590799.0,2021-06-01 16:39:59

"The ""Honor"" System",0,nqq638,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nqq638/the_honor_system/,27,"Hello. 

I work as a ""senior"" teller (which basically just means I've been here longer so they have to pay me a bit more) at a small bank in Central Pennsylvania. I am in my mid 30s with two children. My husband works for USPS and both of us have been working out of the home since the start of the pandemic. When the pandemic was at it's worst around here, we closed the lobby and performed transactions only from the drive thru, and we had been wearing masks since the CDC mandate, for over a year. 

I am fully vaccinated as of May 5. 

When the CDC guidelines changed recently, my employer (which is quite conservative as many banks are) was fairly quick to say that fully vaccinated employees and customers could remove their masks. However, they cannot check who has a vaccine, it is on the honor system. I find myself working now with two co-workers, one management, one not, who I know for a fact are unvaccinated, yet they've removed their masks. 

The environment is stifling to work in anyway. They know I'm a liberal and basically blame me for Trump losing reelection so they treat me like I don't exist. It sucks. That said, this new development really pisses me off, but I find myself wondering if I'm angry because it isn't fair, because it is a dumb idea, or because of our political disagreements. Do you suppose there is any point in saying anything, or should I just firmly place my foot in my mouth for the duration?

Everyone I now got Pfizer, whereas I got Moderna. And no one I know seems to have had such severe arm pain.

   Now Im absolutely not an anti-vaxer, but I feel I must point out that I've never gotten the regular yearly flu vaccine ever, so this was my first experience. I've just been lucky enough to have never gotten the flu, or to at least not have it hit so terribly. Will this change in the future? I don't know, but now here's my Moderna experience:

   Got shot one on May 4th. After about one hour, I started developing a fever and some chills. Maybe over about 12 hours and three separate but lesser waves. Fevers aren't pleasant obviously, but I'm a weirdo in that its nice to curl up in a blanket, drink tons of water (with electrolytes), and dose off watching something dumb. 

Sweated through sheets & clothing, and the accompanying insomnia was the worst bit for me.

 Dose two I had about 7 hours ago, and have yet to see any symptoms, aside from some mild sniffles that may be due to being close to my sister-in-law who works at a day care, and those children always have some type of plague.

  I will absolutely update should anything, if at all develops. I'm told it may take 12+ hours, so while I know I should've waited to post this, I have to admit to having vaccine anxiety before both doses, so I'd rather get this off my chest while its still fresh.

::Small Update:: Well 17 hours later it’s not so bad. Just some very faint chills for an hour or two and my body is warm. The insomnia was the worst of it though. Think I got about 3 hours or so.

I can start: I was originally prescribed gabapentin and PT. Ive used ice packs for concentrated nerve pain, and a heating pack for any muscle spasms.

All her other vaccine symptoms (upset stomach, headache, fever, chills) have gone away, but the anxiety is still persistent.

"Vaxx Report for both doses - Female, 30s, Pfizer. No major side effects.",15,npwp2a,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/npwp2a/vaxx_report_for_both_doses_female_30s_pfizer_no/,2,"**Summary:**

Very minor side effects for both doses: Almost-headaches that were remedied with a single tylenol, increased tiredness, mild aches, wanting more snacks. Needle barely hurt (10x better than getting a blood draw). Arm soreness each time was mild-moderate and went away after a day. No changed in period noticed so far.

**Prep work:** I drank a ton of electrolytes (liquidIV). I've also been supplementing with vitamin C and  D+k2 for months now. I am not sure if that impacted anything but wanted to mention it. Also, I had a decent bit of anxiety regarding side effects so to alleviate that I prepared for the worst which made me feel a bit better.

Some things I did to prepare:

* I was worried about bleeding issues (I get nosebleeds and bruise easily) and blood clots so I went to my doctor and we ordered some labs to double check everything (CBC, Iron, Ferritin, Clotting disorders, protein c, cmp, and I threw in a vitamin D check to see how my supplementation was going.  This made me feel more proactive, and talking to my dr calmed my nerves a bit too. Lab results were good, though I discovered I was a little low on Ferritin.
* I saw a decent amount of reports regarding changes in women's periods so I bought some period underwear just in case I need extra backup. I wore those to bed the night(s) after getting the shot just in case it triggered an early period while I slept (I had read about this happening). It made me feel better to know I was prepared in that way too. Also, it doesn't hurt to have those around anyway.
* The above two methods involve spending money and using health insurance which I know isn't an option for everyone. But, another thing I did to prep for dose 2 is to make a huge batch of chicken soup. This is very economical, especially if you use a whole chicken to make it instead of buying broth + chicken separately.  Feeling prepared with comfort food helped me feel less anxious too. What you don't eat you can freeze and use later.
* Reading this sub was both good and bad. It helped me identify what to be ready for. But it also psyched me out a bit. So, if you need to stop reading, do that. I know it can be hard to know what's real or not sometimes. When that happens - look at the numbers. How many users are in this sub? Ok. Now how many reports are negative? And how many negative reports are there per day? Now compare that to the millions of doses that have already gone out. Even if you 10x the negative reports you see, it is still a small fraction of doses gone out. Also, don't just rely on the internet. Ask people around you that you know in real life. 

**Side effects detail:**

Dose 1: The day-of I didn't really feel any negative side effects at all. I barely felt the needle, I could kind of tell that ""something"" was happening in my body but that was kind of it. The next morning my arm felt sore, it reminded me of the sore you feel if you sleep the wrong way. The soreness went away by the next day. I had some extra tiredness on day 2 and a headache that started to appear but went away after taking a single tylenol. Dose 1 was 1 week before my period was due and it arrived on time without any changes.

Dose 2: Day-of was similar to the first dose. The nurse did tell me that I could take tylenol or ibuprofen if I needed to. I felt fine, but was anticipating being knocked out on day 2.  Day 2 arrives and is fairly uneventful. I was more tired this time, and I spent the day taking it easy and alternating between the couch, bed, and mass effect. By the evening I did have some joint/muscle aches that lasted a few hours, so I took an Aleve before bed just to make sure I got a full night's sleep.  Day 3 I felt pretty much back to normal, except for the tiredness. I remember walking to a local coffeeshop and feeling a bit more tired and breathing heavier than usual. Dose 2 was about 2 weeks before my period is due and I haven't noticed any changes yet.

I am now 5 days out from the second dose and feel pretty much back to normal. I haven't tried exerting myself yet to see how tired I get though. Overall, a pretty mild experience and glad I got it :) I'm looking forward to being able to hang out with my friend who is immunocompromised and her daughter who can't get vaccinated due to allergies. And my other friend who was a smoker for 30 years. And visiting the shop that's partially staffed by people with down's syndrome (they recently just opened back up).

Chest pain after 1st Pfizer vaccine?,18,nptka6,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nptka6/chest_pain_after_1st_pfizer_vaccine/,17,"Hi all, last Thursday I had my first Pfizer vaccine (33M) and had the usual side effects over the coming days including arm pain, fatigue, low grade fever/aches and pains, headaches etc, typical elevated immune response symptoms which all cleared up after 2-3 days. 

However I developed a really worrying symptom of mild to moderate chest pain starting the day after my jab - central and left of my sternum. I waited it out to see if it would disappear but possibly made a mistake on my part - I turned to the internet looking for possible causes and came across the ‘myocarditis’ cases from those who had the Pfizer vaccine including reports on this sub.

Today marks the 5th day since the jab and with no improvement in the chest pain I went to the Hospital to get checked out. The Dr checked my blood pressure and also did an ECG (electrocardiogram) Test and said after reviewing the results everything looked normal, he told me I was the 4th person to come into the hospital today reporting chest pain after the vaccine. He examined me and after applying pressure to my sternum and me indicating slight pain he told me the most likely cause was a condition called   ‘costochondritis’ which is inflammation of the breast bone, he didn’t think the vaccine was the cause.

I’m slightly more reassured from what the Dr says isn’t anything more serious, but one test I read being done on many suspected myocarditis cases alongside an ECG is a blood test to check for elevated protein levels ‘ troponin’ in the heart which would indicate any heart inflammation/damage...I told the DR my concerns but he again reassured me if there was any issue with the heart/myocarditis  the ECG test alone would be sufficient for diagnosing any problem. 

I must admit I would of preferred if they had requested a blood test as well but he obviously didn’t think one was needed, am I over worrying about this? I take on face value what was said I’m more inclined to get my second dose now when my appointment comes around, just hope this chest pain disappears soon because it isn’t helping my anxiety levels!

A Week After the Janssen/J&J Shot,8,npzo9d,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/npzo9d/a_week_after_the_janssenjj_shot/,8,"TL;DR - Slight annoying effect for a bit more than 12 hours, then back to normal. A rather good experience.

\---

It will now be a whole week since my injection. Like many others here, I admit that I had very little confidence in these vaccines.

The point is, I was born with some neurological ""trouble"" and reacted extremely badly to the tetanus vaccine thirteen years ago. Needless to say, between having had this COVID crap in February and not hanging out around the world that much, I had little to no desire to get the vaccine.

To make it short, I finally decided to take a step forward and register for a Johnson & Johnson/Janssen shot last Monday. In my case, the injection itself was only slightly painful for about ten minutes. Not wanting to force on my body, I stayed in my place for the rest of the day. However, I spent about two hours drumming, which potentially helped keep my left arm pain-free. Right after the injection, I was told that most cases of discomfort happen within eight hours of the injection. Eight hours passed, then ten hours, then twelve hours, and still nothing. However, I started to feel cold after the 13th hour.

With this feeling of freezing, it took me three to four hours to fall asleep. Only to wake up a few hours later feeling everything was too warm now. The cold was probably from a slight fever, but I didn't care to get my thermometer at all. I felt a little dizzy from that bad night in the morning, and I had a slight pain in my left arm muscles, but nothing else. In the end, I went out in the afternoon because I didn't want to stay locked up and started to feel almost as good as the day before by mid-afternoon.

Since last Tuesday, nothing else has happened, no headache, feeling of faintness, and no pain in my arm at all. Everything was back to normal pretty fast in my case, but I preferred to wait at least a week before testifying here.",1622597863.0,2021-06-01 18:37:43

My question is really not a question, but I’m a little nervous for the second one because the swollen lymph nodes kind of scared me. I know it’s an immune response, but I rarely have swollen nodes when I’m sick.

(30 F) 2 weeks post-vaxx update...ongoing tachycardia,9,npw0fp,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/npw0fp/30_f_2_weeks_postvaxx_updateongoing_tachycardia/,6,"My first post was here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmbiea/30f_autoimmune_issues_my_pfizer_experience10_days/

Here's a week 2 update...

Good news: The itching has mostly stopped. But my god, did it linger. I still get very mild itching episodes now and again but they're nothing. Very well could be seasonal allergies.

Bad news: Still getting tachycardic out of nowhere. Suddenly woke up around midnight last night (day 15) just feeling ""off"". Dizzy, short of breath, etc...Kept my pulsometer on my finger for hours and watched it randomly bounce between 85-110 all night long for no reason, which kept me from sleeping because I felt like I was jogging. As of this morning it's still hovering around 85-95.

These episodes have been coming out of nowhere. They come on suddenly and last for hours, often a day or two and then disappear. I'm just hoping they fuck off permanently so I can live my life. I can't really do much on days like this because I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack if I so much as vacuum the floor. This is very similar to my POTS flare a few years ago, which took about 8 months to resolve and completely disabled me. It's nowhere near as bad as that flare, but it's still bad. At least it comes and goes and isn't constant like that one was.

This has been happening since about 1 week post-Pfizer. I KNOW it's my faulty immune system at play (I have POTS and some other undiagnosed issues) and not the vaccine itself causing this. I KNOW Covid would have done the same or worse to me. I'm not anti-vaxx so don't jump down my throat. Still don't regret the first dose but this experience definitely solidified by decision not to get the second.

EDIT: forgot to mention, my period is also 3 days late. I've been tracking it for about 4 years and this is pretty unusual for me. Not freaking out yet but it's worth mentioning since other women have been having issues with their cycles after vaccine/Covid as well.",1622588476.0,2021-06-01 16:01:16

I'm not anti vax. I'm not trying to fear monger. I'm just telling my story - my severe reaction to the Moderna,225,np7iqq,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/np7iqq/im_not_anti_vax_im_not_trying_to_fear_monger_im/,186,"I've been debating posting my story here. I'm not anti vax by any means... I support science. I support the notion that for a vast majority of people, the risks of getting covid far outweigh the risks of getting the vaccine. 

But I am reading more and more stories of severe reactions to the vaccine and I can't help but worry. Worry for those who are immunocompromised or suffering from heart conditions and maybe want to give it a second thought. Idk. I just want to put my story out there. 

I got the first Moderna in March. I was already suffering from a health crisis... It is unclear whether or not I at the time had been suffering from long covid. I'll never know for sure. But this could definitely be a factor that explains my reaction to the vaccine so I wanted to mention it. 

Immediately after the vaccine all I had was a mild headache. I wasn't worried. In fact I was hopeful the vaccine would help my existing symptoms. 

That night I was woken from dead sleep with a racing, strong heart beat. I took some of my Ativan for emergencies and went back to sleep. 

The next day was one of the worst days of my life. I was feeling ok, standing in the kitchen cooking and all of a sudden BAM. My heart starts pounding fast. I had to sit down. I was shaking so bad. Thankfully my husband was already on his way home from work so I waited for him. 

He immediately thought it was a panic attack when he got home (I've had panic attacks before and can recognize my physiological manifestations of a panic attack .. this was NOT that). I remember getting frustrated with him because it felt like he wasn't taking my symptoms seriously. I was scared. 

Then all of a sudden... I lost control of my mind. I truly don't know how to explain this. I remember my husband asking me to respond if I could hear him and I could not respond. I couldn't form sentences or speak. My face and body started violently twitching and shaking. I remember my husband laying me down on the ground and telling me to breath. I remember trying to sputter out the words 'i can't control it'. Then, I lost function of my breathing and heart rate. I swear to you... they just stopped. I remember
feeling VERY relaxed all of a sudden .. in a scary way... Like a 'why am I not breathing' kind of way. I started seeing white. Then I remember gasping for air and I managed to glimpse at my pulse ox on my finger. My heart rate had gone down to 60 (no this isn't a bad rate, but considering I was just at 130 a moment prior, it was scary). 

My husband called 911 because it became clear then that something was seriously wrong with my involuntary body functions. The paramedics came quickly, took my vitals. Of course I was fine according to a little drop of blood. But I remember twitching and violently shaking on the ground in front of about 5 grown men, and NONE OF THEM could explain what was going on. They all said they had no idea and hadn't seen anything like it. They wanted to transport me to a hospital but I denied because I figured they wouldn't be able to help either. I remember the demeanor in the room.. they felt sad they couldn't help me. I could feel it in their presence.

They left and shortly after the shaking and twitching finally stopped. I realized I had to pee so I asked my husband to help me get to the bathroom. On my way there... again I truly don't know how to explain this but my body just 'forgot' how to walk for a moment. I was walking and then BAM. My legs felt glued to the ground. I remember thinking 'take another step you dumb bitch what's wrong with you' but my legs just would NOT move. Thankfully this only lasted a few moments. 

It's been a few months and I still suffer from some heart problems. Mainly tachycardia and palpitations upon exertion. I also have debilitating insomnia from the heart stuff waking me up in my sleep. I have since been diagnosed with Dysautonomia. It's unclear whether or not the vaccine itself caused this, or the dystautonomia was already present. 

I'm not trying to insinuate the vaccine gave me dystautonomia. I truly don't know. All I know is a had a severe reaction to it, and I wanted to get my story out there. I'm sure I'll get some shitty comments telling me I'm exaggerating but I'm used to medical gaslighting now. Have at it. But I truly think if you're immunocompromised or if you have existing heart issues, maybe give it a second thought.",1622507797.0,2021-05-31 17:36:37

My dad's Pfizer jabs & resulting deep vein thrombosis,28,nphwh2,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nphwh2/my_dads_pfizer_jabs_resulting_deep_vein_thrombosis/,9,"Both my folks are in their late 70's and therefore signed up for the vaccine as soon as it was available.  Although I am waiting on more data before I consider it for myself, I supported my folks getting the shot(s) as they are certainly at risk.

My dad is a retired M.D. (ENT), type II diabetic, suffers from gout, glaucoma, overweight (probably meets the medical definition of obese), some arterial blockages especially to the kidneys, and takes high blood pressure medication so not exactly the picture of good health but still gets around and is active outside in the summer or in warmer climes when he does the winter snowbird thing.

In retrospect he also thinks he \*may\* have possibly gotten the coronavirus in January 2020 but is not sure. Was on a flight and next to someone coughing/hacking really bad. Days later he started coughing, had congestion in the lungs, and could actually hear wheezing coming from his lungs. Had mentioned he had never had wheezing in the lungs before.  Because he had part of a previous winter trip ruined with a gout attack stranding him in bed for nearly two weeks, he had started taking some colchicine prophylactically to prevent the travel stress from setting one off. Only in hindsight with recent studies have we discovered colchicine may have positive therapeutic effects limiting severity of covid. Anyway, all of this is circumstantial but I thought it may be important and provide a more complete context.  

Both my parents were given the Pfizer jabs. First jab was nothing. My mom did have some soreness in the arm but otherwise neither of my parents had anything to speak of.

After getting their second jab my mom was a bit tired and wiped out the next day but bounced right back. My dad began having severe pain behind the knee, later emanating down his calf. Having a medical background he pretty much knew it was one of two things - either a DVT, or a ruptured bakers cyst. After several days he was convinced it was a DVT because of the lack of any discoloration or other signs of a ruptured bakers cyst.  I don't know if any of you have doctors/retired MDs in the family but my dad doesn't go to doctors for anything unless forced to by my mom, if there's nothing that can really be done about the situation anyway.  He just laid up on the sofa for the next week or so, elevated the leg, did the circulation exercises and hoped for the best, telling us ""well if you find me dead here, just means the clot dislodged and stopped my heart"" blah blah.  Long story short, the clot obviously dissolved with time and a week later he was back on his feet.

He also developed some circulatory issues in his third toe on the same leg several weeks later.  Can't rule out the type II diabetes and poor circulation and I'm no doctor but he was worried the toe was going bad and might turn gangrenous & have to lop it off.  He kept it clean, did the ""wiggle your toes every hour"", made sure to massage it periodically and that resolved itself too.

TL/DR: Nothing clinically confirmed but suspected DVT in the leg and possible peripheral clotting causing poor blood circulation in one toe following the second Pfizer jab. Self-diagnosis from retired ENT surgeon. Full recovery and nothing else to report in the month or two since.",1622537732.0,2021-06-01 01:55:32
My Vaccine Experience,23,npjdqe,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/npjdqe/my_vaccine_experience/,2,"As the flair states, I got the Pfizer vaccine. The vaccines had recently opened up for my age bracket (don’t want to say my specific age, but I’m 18+) and I was able to get an appointment at a clinic right away through the help of my dad’s company. It was a huge relief after being on a waitlist for so long because of my age bracket.

My first dose was on April 4th and it went great! Of course, my arm was a bit sore and I did end up sleeping most of the rest of the day away after I got the vaccine, but that’s normally how I feel with other vaccines I’ve had in the past; just fatigue on the first day and a bit of persistent soreness for about a week after.

Then, I had my second dose on April 29th. That day, I had a couple of other errands I needed to run, so I was out of the house and couldn’t sleep immediately after. The first 4 hours were fine, but then I started to feel like I had a mild sore throat as I was driving home. A few hours after that, I started to feel worse. The sore throat wasn’t much more intense, but I had a serious case of dry mouth and my nose was totally stuffed. Later that night, I started developing a bad migraine and chills. My whole left side felt really sore (I got my shot in the left arm), especially around my neck area and in my armpit for some reason.

(I also had popping ears, but that always happens to me when I have a stuffed nose. Not sure why, but it’s been that way since I was a kid.)

By the next morning, I felt much better and I felt progressively better as the days went on. The most persistent symptoms were a cough, headache, stuffy nose, and body aches, which slowly lessened in intensity overtime. Things were the worst for the first 3 or 4 days following the shot and symptoms practically ceased after that period of time.

Just wanted to share my experience to help others alleviate any fears about getting the vaccine. I know that I personally have a few friends that are really anxious about severe symptoms and telling them how my shots went really helped :)",1622542652.0,2021-06-01 03:17:32

I actually had covid last month, fevers lasted almost two weeks, with really annoying inflammation in my back and knees. I'm having the same sensation but not to the extent of actual covid. 

I was hoping to sleep it off however I woke up from a nightmare that I was passing out from heat stroke, and my fever was higher. Took two tylenols and drank a ton of water. I'm way too tired to go grab the thermometer, but the fever is no where close to the real virus, I should be okay, but I also now appear to have the insomnia again from the fevers and can't fall asleep again.

1st shot: the actual injection was almost completely painless. And I'm really afraid of needles so I was probably tensed up but it still didn't hurt. I had a strange metallic taste reminiscent of salt substitutes (eg potassium chloride) in my mouth for the first day but it went away after that. I felt tired and achey for 2 days, it was mostly cleared up on the 3rd day, and by the 4th day I was back to normal. I did have diarrhea once the day after vaccination but I'd attribute that to my IBS diagnosis. No notable symptoms in the month until the 2nd shot. 

2nd shot: basically the same as the first shot, only I also ran a mild fever (about 100-101 F). I took 400 mg ibuprofen twice a day for 3 days and once on the 4th day and that completely dealt with it. I was expecting the 2nd shot to be way worse based on stories I'd read but I'd say it was 10% worse for me at most. 

It'll be 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine this week and I'm super excited! I'm extremely ready to be in public again without worrying about COVID.

Seeing how it's been 6 months since I had it and immunity about generally speaking is up for debate but the general consensus is that it can last at the shortest 90 days and at the longest 6-8 months? 1 year? 

Hard to say right now and people have gotten it twice .

  I got my first pfizer shot on Friday night.

I noticed some injection site pain( arm) along with some slight neck pain but nothing too bad.

Woke up on Saturday and I felt super sick.

I had chills, body aches ( mainly back, knee joint pain when bending down ) which was expected 

But the I started having a familiar feeling that I had 2 or 3 weeks after I recovered from covid.

Costochrondritos (chest wall inflammation) 

I had a feeling it was because whenever I would take a deep breath I would get pain in my lower back, rib and only chest pain on the left side. Also had some leg pain almost felt like nerve pain I'm not too sure but it was noticeable.

Also my injection site arm was super sore like I couldn't move my arm very much and it was super swollen. 

I also noticed my heartrate was elevated around 98 although tp be honest this could be from anxiety around my symptoms I was having but I think its gone back down to 65-70 resting as of Monday the 31st.

I took it easy had some Tylenol, water Gatorade and didn't do too much that day.

Sunday I felt alot better so I guess I decided it was a good idea to go play golf (local par 3 course near my house since it was nice out) 

My arm wasn't really sore anymore I had some joint pain but not much and my chills were gone so I thought it would be a good idea (it probably wasn't lol) 

I also didn't sleep well 3 hours I'm guessing mainly due to anxiety around my symptoms and stress in general.

So I woke up to go to work on Monday had some water,  Tylenol.

I obviously felt fatigued most likely due to the lack of sleep and I got my morning coffee. 

For the majority of today I had some pretty bad nausea after my coffee which is unusual for me and I had to go poop twice within an hour not quite diarrhea though.

I had some more body aches (mild) 

And the nausea didn't subside until I had dinner I felt better after that.

So this is where I'm at right now I am speaking with my doctor tomorrow morning at 10 am to see what she has to say.

I have read that this isn't completely unheard unheard or uncommon with  people who have had covid and gotten vaccinated.

CovidVaccinated survey repost - Quantifying Info on Qualitative Sub,5,npl93a,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/npl93a/covidvaccinated_survey_repost_quantifying_info_on/,0,"Hello All,

A week or two ago I posted a link to a survey asking questions about everyone's vaccination experience as well as some information about individual lifestyles. The goal of this project was to use some of my data science experience to compare demographic data to symptoms (or lack of symptoms) after taking the vaccine so that there would be a little less uncertainty for those on the fence.

Some interesting initial results - for every symptom I asked about, people who had already contracted covid and then got the vaccine had a higher percentage reported of having a given symptom. To be more specific, people were asked if they had worse headaches, joint pain, body aches, nausea, diarrhea, or cramps after getting the shot, for every symptom the class that answered 'yes' to already having covid had a higher rate of answering 'yes' to each of these symptoms than the 'no' contracted covid class.

I am reposting the survey to collect more responses, as this sub grows every day, and more data is always better. Here is the link:

[https://forms.gle/emgj7WFd4TKZ5THe8](https://forms.gle/emgj7WFd4TKZ5THe8)

Please don't respond if you already filled it out, but please upvote for visibility.

To elaborate further, the goal of this work is neither pro-vax nor anti-vax, it is pro-truth. I feel that in today's day and age, the truth is hard to come by when people's egos are so wrapped up in the correctness of their views. Having read every word of Pfizer and Moderna's FDA applications, there is some stuff in there that seems like an industry work-around to be 'technically correct' and therefor admissible. Not saying that there is anything wrong with anything per se,  but there are clearly ways to word things in pharma to confuse the layman or not draw attention to something (and just to clarify that I am not a layman, my original degree is chemical/biochemical engineering). **I am here now looking for raw data from you, which I will turn into easily digestible graphs, and give back to you, with simple plain english explanations.**

Before you go into the comments and roast me for ""this is a dumb idea"", ""the survey is bad"", ""VAERS exists"", ""this sub is not a representative sample"", or whatever else... I know. This is an idea I had that I am curious about, I have seen interesting results doing these kinds of surveys on other subs before, I enjoy the experience of cleaning and analyzing the data, and if you think its dumb - kindly move along.

Second jab: arm maybe a little more sore this time. I didn't sleep well that night, which could have been for any number of reasons besides the vaccine. Didn't have any (other) side effects. My mom didn't have any side effects. 

That's it. Very boring. But I remember getting a little stressed when I read some of the experiences others have had. So I thought it would be good to do my part and write down my experience. I think it's been long enough that I don't expect any side effects to come up.

Even the initial side effects were mediocre. Of those 12, one person got a fever. One got a headache. All the others got a little fatigue and maybe some minor body aches. 

It’s clear that some folks are being hit hard post vaccine but just wanted to share there are positive, uninteresting stories out there too. The ones hardly worth typing up!",1622534000.0,2021-06-01 00:53:20

Pregnant after Pfizer vaccine + my husband's Moderna experience.,14,npdhfe,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/npdhfe/pregnant_after_pfizer_vaccine_my_husbands_moderna/,2,"So I'll start with my (26f 107lbs) experience getting Pfizer. I have really severe health anxiety so I was terrified to get the vaccine. I was sure that I would be one of the people who had a severe reaction or something (especially after my husband had side effects which I will get to.) However, I ultimately I decided to get it. 

I had no reaction from the first one. I then found out I was pregnant before I was due to get the second shot.

I went ahead and got the second one. Everything was fine after the second shot. I did have a headache the day after, but that could just be a coincidence/pregnancy related. 

As far as the pregnancy goes, I am 7 weeks along and I have only had one OBGYN appointment, but so far everything looks okay and the Dr was happy to hear I was fully vaccinated. 

Now for my husband (33m 225lbs) who struggled with the Moderna vaccine. The first shot was normal/fine, but the second shot was tough. He was overall feeling like crap. A weird side effect we noticed was his eyes were really red/watery. He was sweaty/achy and was sleeping a lot. He had no appetite and said he had weird dreams. His side effects lasted about 10-12 hours. He is still happy he got the vaccine and thinks it's worth it since Covid can be much worse and last longer than 10-12 hours.

I also wanted to add that everyone else that I know IRL who is vaccinated had a good experience/little to no side affects. My husband is the only one who seemed to struggle with it.",1622524273.0,2021-05-31 22:11:13

Aside from that I have no major underlying health conditions and have been trying to keep active. I do suffer from severe anxiety and panic disorder.

One friend did get a fever in the middle of the night but was able to work by lunch the next day.  This is probably 15-20 anecdotal stories.

 I know some people have had negative experiences and I am sympathetic to that, but I Just thought I would throw my (mostly unremarkable experience) out there as well. 

I got my second dose of Moderna on April 9th. 

I remember with the first dose I felt a little tired after and took a nap when I got home. With the second dose I had a sore arm and was a little feverish and achy for about a day and a half. 

I have had three periods since my second dose - one period started the day after the second shot (which was on time.) The next one happened 28 days after that, which is what's normal for me. 

My most recent period DID start early (only 17 days after my previous period) HOWEVER, I have had some dietary changes and have recently been on steroids and antibiotics and other associated meds for a recently-developed bacterial sinus infection (which I am prone to). Also, 17 days is unusual for me, though not completely unprecedented. 

My periods themselves (duration, discharge, cramps) have been normal and unremarkable. 

Regarding the sinus infection and recent early period- I feel that the more time passes the more likely a person is to have some health event or other but these are things that are not that far outside the norm for me and have other likely causes. 

I don't feel like I have had anything significant or directly related to the vaccine.",1622511723.0,2021-05-31 18:42:03

I'm 22f with no underlying health problems (that I know of) and I got my first dose of Pfizer yesterday. After the shot, I had a bit of soreness where the needle went in, but that was about it. About six hours afterwards, I started to feel kind of loopy (the best way I can describe it is if I were to take a Benadryl or something that causes drowsiness) and I had a slight upset stomach and a bit of nausea but that was about it. I went to sleep after this, and did sleep for around 12 hours or so, and when I woke up this morning my arm did hurt significantly more than it did the previous day, and I did have a splitting headache most of the day. After drinking a shit ton of water, taking an Advil, and going for a short walk, it's been about 30 hours since my shot and I'm back to feeling nearly normal. I would say this was a pretty mild reaction, which surprised me since I got my flu vaccine in November and that made me feel worse than this. Not very exciting, but as I said, I'm here to convey my experience in hopes of providing some sort of reassurance to those about to get their vaccine or are on the fence about getting theirs!

Update: it's been a full 48 hours since my shot. I feel great, and even made it to work today where I do landscaping. No arm soreness or anything. overall, a very positive experience!",1622529425.0,2021-05-31 23:37:05

I got the 1st shot of Pfizer in early March, had a severe reaction that lasted 1.5 months.

First dose I had swollen glands and felt slow. Any advice on what to do with think of the chest pains? I woke up day 2 of chest pains, they are not as bad but still have chest pressure, all the other covid vaccine side affects have subsided (body aches, chills) I know I can’t expect medical advice on here but just wondering if anyone had a similar experience with chest pains post second dose, normal or not? and when will it go away?

i'm a female in my mid-20s-- overweight but not obese, PCOS, IBS, HS, generalized anxiety. my partner is a male also in mid-20s-- previously smoked cigarettes for \~8 years, healthy weight. neither of us have previous history with adverse reactions to vaccines nor anaphylaxis in general. 

**TLDR; we got our first shots early april, then second shots late april at a state site, made sure to drink a lot of fluids, rest well, get electrolytes, all that. he had minimal reactions to both vaccines, reminded him of his TDAP. my first was fine, my second was as if i had the flu but resolved in less than 48 hours post-dose. i've had two menstrual cycles since then, both completely on-time, normal, and fine. would do it again.**

my first dose: had a metallic taste in my mouth \~15 minutes post shot. my anxiety was definitely elevated but i didn't pass out. generally nervous around doctors, needles, etc. so only the metallic taste stood out. no pain at injection site. 12 hours after the first shot i was only mildly fatigued + sore arm the evening of-- very much reminded me of when i got my TDAP booster. sore arm lasted another 36 hours, got my period right on time (but a couple days after the shot, might i add) so who knows where my normal pre-menstrual fatigue started and post-vaccine began. 

his first dose: headache started within \~15 minutes post shot (also happened with his TDAP) so we got some food, he was tired and had a sore arm as well. he said his brain felt like the day after an acid trip lol

my second dose: got it in my right arm that time because i sleep on my left side (didn't plan that out well the first dose, ouchies). temporary metallic taste in mouth again. 12 hours after the 2nd dose i was exhausted. went to bed around 9:30 PM, woke up at 3 AM to feel like i was being run over by a bus, like i had the flu but without the brain fog. my body was incredibly sore, and i had a ""fever"" of 100 F. it took forever to lift limbs and move around, i felt like molasses but **so sore.** literally thought i wasn't going to be able to make it to the toilet to pee at one point, just laying there in shock as to how absolutely shitty i felt. looked over and my partner was sleeping like a baby. got my period about two weeks later (also on time, also normal). i want to emphasize that at no point did it feel out of control or dangerous, but like i was a kid again where my immune system was just tearing through my body. not even 36 hours later it was like it never happened. 

his second dose: also switched arms for second dose, because he made the same mistake i did. sore arm, no headache. yeah. that's it. a little warm at 99.5 but could windmill his arm around for funsies. again with the ""day after an acid trip"" comment. he was pretty smug about how little it affected him lol

what prompted me to write this was yesterday he looked at me and said, ""you ever get phantom pain from the injection sites?"" and i was a little taken aback because yeah, maybe once or twice since the second shot (over a month ago) has it felt like 48 hours post-vaccine on my most recent arm. hmm.",1622516936.0,2021-05-31 20:08:56

"My J&J experience (32F, and my boyfriend 30M)",20,np21cd,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/np21cd/my_jj_experience_32f_and_my_boyfriend_30m/,13,"Hey guys, I spent the entire morning before my vaccine reading up people's experiences on here. Now I'll add my own and hope it helps some people out there who are nervous. I have a really nasty case of Generalised Anxiety disorder so I was extra scared. 

Briefly for context: We live in Denmark, Denmark dropped both J&J and Astera Zeneca from the official vaccine plan. They also put people in our age group in the absolute last vaccination group, which is now in autumn and about to be pushed back yet again. Denmark opened an ""opt in"" system for the J&J and AZ, with a mandatory doctor video consultation to see if you can be approved for ""the benefits outweighing the risks"". my boyfriend were some of the first to sign up. They had not started the consultations at that point, but it was less than a week later we both had ours. My boyfriend was approved easily, me as a woman I was extremely nervous I would get turned down (literally dry heaving and shaking before) but my doctor just made sure I knew the risks. We both were offered appointments for the vaccine the following day and could alter them so we were five minutes apart on the same day.

So basically not only do I have severe anxiety, but I live in a country that has actively tried to scare us off these vaccines. Despite making them opt in the government keeps trying to put people off with adverts and many GP's are against it for ""making people feel pressure to take the riskier vaccines"" since Denmark rolled out its own corona passport a month ago despite a very low vaccination rate, requiring regular testing for unvaccinated people. 

So stakes were high for me. I miss my family in the UK so badly and I haven't seen some for a year and some for longer. My anxiety has skyrocketed during this pandemic and especially with the vaccines here being repeatedly postponed. 

My vaccine was yesterday afternoon. And of course having anxiety, of course being someone who was terrified of not being accepted for this, I started to get scared of blood clots and horrible side effects at the same time. So I was basically shaking as I went in for my shot. We arrived 10-15 minutes early but could go straight through, there was barely any wait. The staff were *extremely nice*, offered me one of the stalls where I could lay down for the jab, talked me through the whole thing. The jab, despite reading about it being very painful and burning, was barely different from the blood tests I have every year. I could not have asked for better from them. Then I met my boyfriend in a seating area where we needed to wait for 15 minutes in case we had an allergic reaction.

It is almost 24 hours since we were jabbed, this is how we felt yesterday:

32f-

* Mild soreness around the vaccination site.

* Anxiety symptoms, but fewer than before the shot.

30m-

* Just the soreness

We both woke up in the night, which is normal. 

32f-

* Slightly warm, which is actually not unusual for me. I have a thinner blanket near my bed all year round and was comfortable with that.

* an extremely mild headache that came and went, so mild that I couldn't be bothered to take painkillers.

* mild skin sensitivity, I could feel my blankets more, but again it was so mild I couldn't be bothered to get pain killers and fell asleep.

30m-

* He felt cold, but was able to sleep when he fully wrapped up in our duvet.

It has now been almost 24 hours:

32f-

* I have the mild headache, but again, *super* mild.

* My arm is still a bit sore around where I was vaccinated.

* I'm a bit tired but not unable to function.

30m

- Says his arm is a bit more sore today but still manageable. He says like someone punched him, but like kids playing a dumb game where they punch each other and it's not that bad. 

Seriously, I have suffered way more from anxiety symptoms than any side effects so far. And I feel so relieved to have a coronapassport now that doesn't require testing. I feel happier about our trip to the Faroe Islands we booked for this July (it is under Denmark's kingdom but it is still easier with a vaccine). And most of all, once the UK lifts the 10 day quarantine for travellers from here, I know we can go. This has been a positive experience, and if I can do it you can too!

And yes I know there's the ""danger zone"" coming but we have been very informed of the risks. They are rare but if we have any of the symptoms we will speak to our doctors or call the emergency line if it is serious. Most likely though we won't, and if we (or more likely, I) do it is most likely treatable since I know the warning signs.

It feels crazy that we are the first fully vaccinated in our immediate families now when we were expected to be the last!

Edit: And today, the country that has been actively trying to discourage people from getting these vaccines is now ""reconsidering J&J"" due to how slow the rollout here is going.

Edit 2: 12pmish on Tuesday (vaccine was Sunday at roughly 3pm) and I feel pretty much normal, I slept fine last night too. Boyfriend has been to work both days since (no work for me, my job is tourism related so still closed) and slept better last night too.",1622492098.0,2021-05-31 13:14:58

0-2 Hrs: No side effects. ""Easiest shot I've ever had."" I was a bit sad that I didn't get Pfizer for some reason. 

2 Hrs: Arm began to get sore, minor head ache, a bit sleepy

4Hrs: Definitely sleepy, ready for bed but stayed up until about 10:30pm.

6Hrs: In Bed. Arm is noticeably sore, but still able to sleep on it. 

12-13Hrs: Woke up feeling tired. Had a hard time getting out of bed for work. Got ready for work and felt dazed and had some chills while drying off and getting dressed.

14-18Hrs: At work feeling kind of out of it, but it's an interesting (not necessarily a bad) feeling. Not sure if it's phycological. Slight chills, with a slight head ache. Arm feels sore, but should feel fine in about 18-36 more hours. Slight chills and minor lingering head ache.

3 days after my second Pfizer shot on 5/4/2021 I had a rapid heart rate episode with cold/shivers/shakiness and short of breath. I began to have these episodes frequently and I had another one last night at 12:25am. What helped a couple times is passing a bowel movement which would stop the rapid heart rate. 

These episodes typically happen around 12-1am, sometimes 3-4am, and I also noticed a few times they happened at 8-9pm.

Consider the following scenario:

Person A is fully vaccinated. Person A is friends with person B. Person B is vaccine hesitant, and hasn't yet received his vaccine. Person C is person A's elderly, chronically ill aunt, who refuses to receive a COVID vaccine due to exposure to conspiracy theories.

Now, person A has chosen to abstain from interactions with person B until person B receives the vaccine. Person A is doing this because person A is worried that if she spends time with person B, she may be exposed to COVID-19 and then carry the virus with her when she goes to visit person C, thereby exposing person C to COVID-19.

Could someone please ELI5 how this works? It's been explained to me before, but I have a hard time wrapping my mind around it. Why would a vaccinated person worry about carrying COVID-19 from one unvaccinated person to another? Thanks!",1622516686.0,2021-05-31 20:04:46

I can’t sleep, I’m anxious. I don’t know if there are long term affects that will kill me in the future and that I don’t know about, but maybe I’m just not educated enough. I guess I’m just looking for reassurance. I’m just so afraid I’m regretting my decision.. maybe I should’ve waited a little longer to find out what the vaccine could do. I feel like I’m trapped in my body now. Does anyone have any reassuring words to help with my regret? I really don’t want to regret getting vaccinated I’m so afraid of death. I’m also suffering from bad panic from actual fear of getting COVID, and I’ve always been a hypochondriac and suffer from bad health anxiety I wish there was more information available because I keep reading on this specific blog about how a lot of people are having really random far-fetched side effects that are leaving them hospitalized. I don’t know if these people are being honest or if their symptoms are linked to the vaccine but it’s honestly scaring me. The more I look up things the more afraid I get, and I can’t help it because I keep trying to look for reassurance and there is no data to reassure me. I’m literally afraid I’m   die in my sleep. It also doesn’t help that my parents tried to instill fear in me about the Covid vaccine. They kept telling me that it alters my DNA and that they don’t know what’s gonna happen 2-10 years from now if it’s gonna have any adverse side effects. i’m honestly so afraid. I even asked the doctor before vaccinating me and told her what my parents were telling me and she reassured and congratulated that I made the right choice but I still can’t help but feel afraid and like maybe I made a mistake.

EDIT: I also want to clarify I’m not trying to fear monger anyone. It’s long term worth it to get the protection against this deadly virus!

I got my first moderna shot almost two weeks ago. I was on the fence about getting the vaccine due to health anxiety and underlying health issues. Basically I was just worried we didn't know enough about the vaccines and they hadn't been tested enough to trust them.

Went ahead and got my first shot, and felt completely fine the first two days after other than some arm soreness.I was pumped cos I thought I was going to get thru this with no symptoms. On the third day, I started having chest pain and discomfort really bad. Just felt like my chest area was inflamed. Then the migraines started. For a couple days I had a really bad tingling/burning sensation in my face, hands, and feet. Then the overall fatigue and weakness set in. My symptoms are going up and down. Yesterday I felt okay, just tired. Then today I feel terrible. I'm so weak that walking around is a chore. The chest pain has died down some in the last few days, but overall I just feel really bad. Depressed.

I was diagnosed with heart failure/cardiomyopathy 2.5 years ago, but these are all new symptoms I'm feeling. My heart failure has been under control for the last 1.5 years. In fact I saw my EP the 2nd day after my vaccine (feeling normal) and my EKG, HR, BP and everything looked normal. Like I said, these symptoms came on third day.

If things haven't improved by tomorrow, I'm going to head in to my doc. Thanks for listening.",1622448979.0,2021-05-31 01:16:19
For those who experienced mild upper chest burning / soreness sensation coupled with chest tightness after 1st or 2nd Pfizer dose - how long did it last overall for you?,8,np1yql,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/np1yql/for_those_who_experienced_mild_upper_chest/,5,"Update - 2nd June 2021: I ended up being taken to hospital after suffering with some scary palpitations causing shortness of breath when getting out of bed yesterday morning (day 5 of symptoms) which was then exasperated by what I believe to be a panic attack (a first for me). Had an xray, bloods taken and ecg and all came back normal. A nurse I spoke to admitted I hadn't been the first to come in with these symptoms after receiving this particular shot and that only one of the cases had been serious which put me a little more at ease. Doc said quite a few of my symptoms were consistent with Costochondritis but some weren't like the constant burning sensation feeling so put it down to general musculoskeletal pain and to come straight back if it gets worse. He intimated that my menstrual cycle potentially could be a factor in how my body reacted after the jab but didn't want to go into further detail (it happened to start yesterday whilst in the hospital). I did ask how long the symptoms would continue but understandably he couldn't advise.

 I'm not big on hospitals and I've only ever visited a&e twice in my life for a fracture and pretty bad cut to my finger so I was incredibly impressed and grateful for the prompt help I got yesterday in what became quite a scary situation for me. If you get any type of persistent chest pain, as people have said below in some of the comments made on this post, the right thing really is to get it checked out to be on the safe side. I'm very relieved in my case that everything seems to be looking normal, and that other people have been experiencing the same so I'm not alone on this. Just going to take it 🐌 slow for a while. Will update if anything changes.

Original post:
It's not massively painful, just rather uncomfortable. Having seen posts on here hearing how other people have also experienced this I'm just curious to know how long it lasted for you guys? I have also noticed slight shortness of breath when trying to do some gardening a few days after the dose too so ive been taking it easy since as I feel my chest is just a little inflamed. I'm 31F, no underlying health conditions and had my 1st Pfizer dose last Thursday 27th May. Other than a very sore arm for a few days this is the only reaction ive experienced from the vax. Also just to clarify i'm very much still planning to get my second dose 🙂. Thanks in advance.",1622491851.0,2021-05-31 13:10:51

I have been seeing a lot of people posting the same thing that I am experiencing and it’s really making me scared. I was all for the vaccine but now I feel like I made a mistake. I experienced episodes of rapid heart rate and dizziness which would only be relieved by going #2 which is honestly just really weird because I thought it was just a panic attack but a panic attack has never been connected to shitting 14 times in one night for me... someone posted the same exact thing and I just thought it was weird multiple people were experiencing this so even though i experience panic attacks often this made me think maybe it wasn’t a panic attack. I also just feel so run down and sick and have a runny nose and sore throat and lots of congestion which i thought was allergies but I’m seeing so many people post the same thing and I just *feel* sick too, not just allergies. My sore throat went away a few days ago and I thought I was getting better despite the stuffy nose but then tonight I developed a dry cough, and it’s the type of cough where I can’t go 5 seconds without going into a coughing fit. It literally came out of nowhere which was also scary. Just some more info: i got my second dose of moderna 12 days ago, I’m a 21 y/o female, and I just had covid in March. I’m afraid I shouldn’t have gotten the vaccine so soon after having covid but I needed it for school and no one at the clinic said getting the vaccine was bad after having covid. 

I’m also afraid to drink because the first time I experienced the rapid heart rate and dizziness was when I was drinking the same day (I’ve also experienced it when I wasn’t drinking but still) I don’t want to drink again and experience the same thing because it was honestly the scariest and worst experience I’ve had in awhile. It took me DAYS to recover after that initial experience and I don’t want to go through that again. I would really appreciate advice or if someone has experienced the same thing or really just any response would be helpful.

Edit: my period has also been wonky this month which I know a lot of people with periods have been reporting. I understand that could be a normal immune response but I just thought I’d add it.",1622461007.0,2021-05-31 04:36:47

I am still on the fence about whether or not I will personally get the second shot and will be deciding after I get a lot of testing done over the next month.

I suspect that I may have an overactive immune system & underlying autoimmune condition that could be why my inflammation was so out of control. *I also believe I suffered longer than I should have because I delayed trying to reduce my inflammation* (because I thought my spine was getting worse as I have severe scoliosis and did not immediately realize all of my issues were caused by a delayed inflammatory response). This is not medical advice but what has ultimately helped me has been eating an anti-inflammatory diet, fish oil supplements and going for a walk every day that I can manage to. I have made inflammation reduction my top priority and it has helped a lot. I have also been taking NSAIDs but am trying to cut down on those now as my symptoms are reducing in severity. 

I have not been able to speak to my primary doctor yet but will be speaking to her in early June. I am planning to get blood work done to check my inflammation levels, my hormone levels (as the symptoms have seemed to flare more around my menstrual cycle), my thyroid & any other tests that they can offer to detect autoimmune issues. I am also going to be asking for a referral to a cardiologist as one can never be too careful when they've had chest pain issues though I do suspect at this time that most of my chest pain issues can be attributed to my scoliosis & quite possibly costochondritis that was likely triggered by the vaccine (but has since resolved on it's own).

**The symptoms I still have after 8 weeks that have reduced in severity:** 

* muscle pain
* joint pain
* muscle stiffness
* tingling & numbness in my feet
* overall fatigue

**The symptoms I still have after 8 weeks that have NOT reduced in severity:** 

* bulging veins

**The other symptoms that I listed in my first post have resolved completely** & for the most part, my pain is down to mostly regular levels now. Overall, I'm glad that I have received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine for the protection that it offers & am very grateful to everyone else that gets vaccinated because it helps to protect people like myself who may not be able to get the second dose. 

If I do not get the second dose of Pfizer specifically, I plan to continue wearing a mask whenever I go out in public indefinitely & will get vaccinated once a vaccine is approved in Canada that seems safer for my specific body.",1622425979.0,2021-05-30 18:52:59

Final update: Sinovac vaccine 2nd dose after having anaphylaxis to Covid-19,15,non0qz,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/non0qz/final_update_sinovac_vaccine_2nd_dose_after/,4,"Well well, I wasn't expecting this*! I pre-medicated with a high dose of antihistamines (H1 and 2) and expected a rash again, maybe worse this time because it's the second dose. But to my surprise, my reaction to the second vaccine was SO mild I wouldn't have caught the little redness on my skin if I hadn't been looking at my face every couple of minutes during my 30min wait. And this time, it went away real quick and did NOT come back. No allergy symptoms a week later, no itchiness, no swelling. Hopefully if I did get COVID again despite the vaccine, my immune system won't overreact to it this time! 
It's been a week and I'm fine. My side effects were being sleepy for a day and tired for another day (nothing ñike COVID fatigue though!) and a tiny bit of pain on my forearm and wrist a couple of hours after the vaccine.

I didn't experience period disturbance from the 1st vaccine either. All in all, it's been a good experience, and I'm super glad all of my close family members and my partners' are fully vaccinated as well. 


* If you need context, you can check my post history in this group but long story short: I'm Chilean, 31 years old. I had COVID a year ago with mild symptoms, then on day 14 I had anaphylaxis to covid - urticaria and angioedema plus tachycardia and a mild fever. Then I was hypersensitive to everything that could possibly give me an allergy and had to stay on a high dose of antihistamines for 6 months. I asked an immunologist if I could get vaccinated and the answer was yes, but with extra precautions because it would cause a reaction, but it would still be milder than getting reinfected. I had a rash after dose 1 but it was ok - and here I am, a week after dose 2.",1622445045.0,2021-05-31 00:10:45

My arm started getting sore around 4PM that day but that was to be expected. Around 8PM i started getting super tired and just wanted to lay down. I slept fine most of that night and woke up around 7AM Saturday with a horrible headache and mild body aches.  I took some Tylenol and it helped the aches and head but I was still super out of it and went back to sleep. Throughout Saturday I was napping then awake sore then not sore. One second i would feel almost fine the next i would feel like i was going to pass out from fatigue. I got the chills a couple of times in the afternoon but when taking my temperature it was normal. I kept Tylenol in my system all day so that may be the reason why my temp never got high. I went to bed around 10PM feeling pretty poor but slept all night without issue. I woke up around 8AM this morning 5/30 and immediately noticed an improvement. I no longer was having aches. My headache was 98 percent gone and i was actually not tired. The only lingering side effect is a sore arm.

I hope this is the right place for this, but I’m finding a lot of conflicting info by googling so figured I’d ask Reddit. Also to clarify I’m 100% pro vaccine, I don’t want this to be misunderstood. For reference I’m 29f. 

I got my 2nd dose of Pfizer exactly 11 days ago, the day after I had low grade fever, chills, body aches and nausea. That was gone the next day and I felt fine. Yesterday I woke up with a runny nose and minor cough, summed it up to allergies because my allergies have been flaring up, and went to work. Drank twice the amount of coffee I typically do before work and felt like I was in a brain fog the whole day and couldn’t wake up. I got 8ish hours of sleep which is pretty typical for me. 
As the day progressed I felt a little better but at about 7:30pm I got hit by a wave of nausea, followed by body aches and a general feeling of being unwell. I left work early because I could barely stand, went home and ate some soup and proceeded to feel worse and worse. Today I feel a little better but still like I have a head cold and can’t really walk around the house without feeling dizzy. I’m not going back to work until I get tested for covid just to be sure but I’m really hoping I didn’t get it.

The second vaccine absolutely sucked. Within 4-5 hours I had a massive pulsating headache as well as some light nausea. Eventually it subsided for a bit but then at night I had the absolutely worst sleep of my life - my brain wouldn’t stop and I was fluctuating between too warm and too cold every 5-10 minutes. More or less emulated the flu. 

Today has been the same thing. Sweating, chills, joint pain, headache, nausea, etc.

I also felt very tired for the next week and a half after the first dose. This went away after 2-3 days. 

I got my second dose on Friday. That was a fucking nightmare. I got the shot around 2pm. I felt fine until about 8 then I started feeling a bit nauseous and dizzy so I went to bed. I woke up at 2am in a cold sweat shaking and had to run to the bathroom because I was having stomach issues. I felt like I was extremely drunk. I could barely walk and the room felt like it was spinning. My body hurt and I had a lot of joint pain that made it impossible to get comfortable.

Family history of diseases related to blood clots (DVT, gout, stroke). COPD. High blood pressure (mine is close to being considered low). Dementia. Stomach cancer. Ulcerative colitis. Crohn's. Heart failure is the more common cause of death, usually late 80s and older (great aunt passed last year aged 101). Paternal great uncle literally dropped dead a few years ago in his 70s (the youngest of his siblings), heart stopped without warning and never restarted, perfect health. He stood up from his chair, said something's wrong, then dropped. Maternal cousin once removed died last year just short of his 60th birthday, heart attack with no health problems leading up to that point, lifetime cigarette use, didn't have COVID.

I have the Marburg I polymorphism (factor VII activating protease). 

I have several polymorphisms increasing my risk for several autoimmune diseases - lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Hashimoto's to name a few. This coupled with me already having pernicious anemia, it can almost be considered not a matter of if, but when, I'll be diagnosed with at least one more autoimmune disease. Every time I catch another infectious illness I wonder if that one will be the trigger.

I'm active on account of my job. Average 10,000 to 25,000 steps per day in steel toed boots pulling up to 300 ft steel braided hose and holding a steel gun while spraying overhead. I eat well thanks to my boyfriend being a great cook and he's incredibly knowledgable about nutrition.

About 10 minutes after my shot I developed a vasovagal attack. Now this is really weird. I've been injected >150 times in my life, mostly cyanocobalamin (B12), and I've never had that happen until now. A needle into the arm is old hat. Routine. So used to it and bored during the process. I drank lots of water. I had breakfast. I had a great sleep. I was relaxed. My legs were raised on a chair on account of my herniated disc. What gives? I don't get it.

I did specifically ask for orange juice when offered the selection in the observation area, as I recalled that vitamin C helps counter oxidative stress.

Injection site (left shoulder) was sore and tender for 4 days, felt like I shoulder checked a truck. Random pains all over, especially my left leg - my good leg - and mostly in the calf and ankle. Intermittent chest pressure and chest pain that is also felt in left shoulder blade area (felt similar pains last spring and in 2017, EKG normal last year). There was a couple days where it was painful to swallow food, and that pain was in a different location than the chest pain. Shortness of breath on day 2. Headache that feels similar to a migraine but it's in a different location and when it strikes it doesn't respond to Tylenol. 

I was on cycle day 5 the day of the shot, and I ended up bleeding an extra 3 days and am spotting today (cycle day 11). I'm still experiencing cramps.

Yesterday and today my stool was a light yellow-green.

With each passing day I feel more fatigue and dizziness, which is progressing to full blown vertigo. I feel like I'm floating around at times, similar to when I was severely anemic but still nowhere near as bad. Muscles, especially in my legs and neck, are getting increasingly stiff and sore, which feels weird because I almost never have sore muscles unless I have a serious injury. My right sciatic feels irritated again so I wonder if my herniated disc has been exacerbated somehow.

My appetite is decreasing. I went from 127 to 126 lbs in 6 days.

This morning I woke up and the fingers in my left hand were stiff and range of motion was greatly reduced. Range of motion gradually improved the longer I was awake. The last time I recall that happening was in 2016. Back in about 2012 I tested negative for rheumatoid arthritis (I don't recall the circumstances from around that time thanks to the 2014 concussion), and this March my C-reactive protein was a solid zero.

I'm still able to do my everyday activities, just slower. Focusing on tasks that require more thought are difficult - this post took me a long while to write.

Going by how my body has behaved in the past (with the exception of that weird bacterial bronchitis in 2006 which took 5 months and 3 different antibiotics), I should bounce back to 100% within this next week.

I used to go out and social swing dance with people. This stopped with the pandemic, but apparently it's slowly starting again for those who are vaccinated. I would love to go to these. This was the real push to get me to schedule it.

I scheduled it for Monday afternoon. I'm getting Pfizer. I know I will be anxious, so I have a family member coming with me. I hope I don't have a panic attack. I think I might leave this group for a week or so, so I won't be influenced into thinking I have side effects. Wish me luck!

Edit: Seriously people. Don't try to attack me or change my mind. I have done months of research into studies, vaers and I have talked to people who have worked on other vaccines. This was not meant as a place for debate.",1622352955.0,2021-05-29 22:35:55
Experiencing weird side effects?,24,no3qza,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/no3qza/experiencing_weird_side_effects/,6,"Hi. I (26F) received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on May 22nd. I had no side effects, aside from injection-site pain, however, now one week later I've been *very* nauseous over the past two days and am experiencing heavy spotting, which is odd because I'm between periods. (Granted, I also had sex on the same day of my vaccine, so I've had concern these are implantation symptoms, but the spotting isn't like what I've read about implantation bleeding; it's mostly old but also with crimson blood and a *lot* of tissue.) I've been drinking a lot of water and taking Zofran 8mg to ease the nausea. I haven't vomited (knock on wood).

I'm very excited to have had my first Pfizer vaccine 2 weeks ago now. Afterwards I did have the known side effect of a swollen lymph node near the armpit (same side as injection site). So that didn't worry me and the tenderness went away after a few days...

About a week ago, I developed a swollen lymph node in my neck on the opposite side of my body to vaccination site. I can't find anything on this, hence I'm here. If it's vaccine side effect related like the other lymph node swelling, that's fine. But if this isn't related, I'll be booking in to see my GP.

Female, 20 years old, healthy weight (bmi of 21). Asthma, POTS, celiac disease. My cycles usually range from 24 days to 29 days. My periods are regular and painless, but very heavy. I’ve never had covid, and it’s been many years since I’ve had a cold or flu. I take 200mg Sertraline and 10mg ceterizine daily.

I got my first Pfizer dose on April 5, day 12 of my 29 day cycle. No side effects, and my period after that dose was normal.

3 weeks later in a new cycle, I got my second Pfizer dose on May 3, day 11 of my 26 day cycle. No side effects besides a very sore arm near the injection site. My period after that dose was normal.

…

I was pretty nervous to get my two covid shots because I reacted to my flu shot in October 2020 a few months prior VERY severely, but my covid shots went well! I guess my flu shot reaction was just a fluke because I’ve never reacted to any other vaccine, and I stay up to date on all of them (including flu shot every year). 

But anyway, hopefully my good experience can ease your anxieties about the shot! Just remember that feeling some side effects for a few days is better than feeling sick with covid for a week or more. There are fewer side effects (both temporary and permanent) and fewer deaths from the vaccine than from covid.",1622383848.0,2021-05-30 07:10:48

I got my first Pfizer Vac early May and had the normal side effects. Sore muscle at my injection site, low grade fever, full body joint pains and chills. Lasted about 48 hrs and I was fine. 

Today, I got my 2nd dose at the same hospital. As soon as the nurse injected I felt burning and pain in my shoulder, where I never felt anything during my first dose during injection. 

The nurse said “oh wait” when she went to put the band-aide on...but I thought nothing of it because after the initial pain of the injection, my arm felt fine. I waited the 15 minutes and left. 

Then I get home and see the band-aide literally on my shoulder, above any muscle. An hour later my shoulder joint was IN SO MUCH PAIN! It has gotten worse and at this point I can not lift my vaccinated arm without severe pain in my shoulder. Pain is in my shoulder JOINT, not muscle pain which I felt after my first dose and other IM vaccines. I can not lift my arm at all, it is literally almost stuck.

I also have pretty severe PMS, I feel tired/miserable and have poor sleep for 2 weeks prior to my period and it can often be over a week late. I am very sensitive to hormone affecting drugs.

Here’s how it went:
- Thursday: got the vaccine at around 2pm. It took a fraction of a second and didn’t feel anything. Started developing a sore arm before bed. Painful arm slightly disrupted sleep.
- Friday: painful arm 100% resolved with an Epsom salts bath
- Saturday: feeling good, a bit tired
- Sunday: I woke up with an unusual, mild burning sensation in my chest that persisted all day

It’s been 9 days since the vaccine and I am happy to report that I got my period like clockwork. I did have disrupted sleep, tiredness and poor mood but I track my period and those were not more severe from my regular pms symptoms.

2nd dose: It wasn't that bad too. I woke up im middle od night with a fever, feeling very cold and body pain, especially in my bones. My heart rate was 120 but It's not   very bad for me.

What is the point of getting vaccinated if Ive already had Covid-19?,443,nn9i0f,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nn9i0f/what_is_the_point_of_getting_vaccinated_if_ive/,252,"I need someone to explain to me in detail what the vaccine does for me that my body already hasn't. 
I'm not a scientist or anything so I may be wrong, but my understanding is, vaccine cause your body to have an immune response. They are essentially introducing a pathogen into your body in a safe way(maybe the virus is dead or inactive or something). This causes your body to produce antibodies and then your body will now remember and recognize the pathogen in the future and knows how to produce those same antibodies in the future. You body does this whenever it encounters a virus, whether by natural infection or through the means of a vaccine. 
I've had covid but I keep seeing that I should still be vaccinated. This does not make sense to me. Hasn't my body already done what vaccine makes the immune system do?

So my first shot I really had no side effects besides arm pain around the injection area. It wasn’t anything unbearable so I didn’t use any pain relievers. I had read somewhere to make sure you’re hydrated before getting your vaccine to help avoid side effects, so I drank a bottle of water before getting mine but I don’t know if that actually is the reason my pain was minimal lol.

I had my second shot on Thursday morning, and this time the arm pain was a bit more severe, instead of just being the injection area it was the entire arm. And then at midnight, around 15 hours after injection, I started feeling very fatigued and had to lay down, within minutes I got these incredibly intense chills. I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up with a dull pain throughout my whole body. I basically spent the whole day sleeping, but it was really on and off, one second I’d feel better but then I’d feel sick again. Overall yesterday was just a mix of headache/body pain/chills/fatigue/loss of appetite/nausea. I needed quite a few Tylenol to make it through the day. 

And today, the most noticeable symptom at the moment is the arm pain, I think it might have swelled a little bit? A lot of the pain seems to be central to the joints, and the right side of my body. Which either could be because of the injection being on the right side or maybe I just slept wrong lol. Also some lightheadedness but overall I’m feeling so much better.

I hope this helps in some way, I’ll try to keep updated. :)

A little background, we live in southern Germany where, in my opinion, the distribution of vaccines has been disastrous. My girlfriend was vaccinated on May 27 and I was vaccinated the next day. 

I will update the post as far as possible with the progress of both.   


**Same-day symptoms:**

* Medium pain at the vaccination site 
* We both developed a fever during the night, in my case higher than hers. 

**First day after the vaccine:**

* She no longer had a fever, however, fatigue sensation, most of the day on the couch.
* I still had fever most of the day.
* I have joint pain, specifically in both shoulders and hips. Also slight ""internal"" pain specifically in my armpits and in the kidney area.

**Second day after the vaccine:**

* she had very mild muscle pain, rest of the symptoms disappeared.
* I no longer have fever or muscle aches.

**Third day after the vaccine:**

* We both are 100% back to normality, vaccine site no longer hurts.

**Since J&J vaccine is not that relevant in this subreddit, from now on I will only post relevant updates and major milestones, that means 16 days and 1 month after vaccine day**

‐------------

We are currently in the 16 days where we must be alert to any symptoms of thrombosis. At the vaccination site we were told that some of the symptoms are the following:

* Headache (the worst of your life).
* Shortness of breath
* Cold or sweaty hands
* Weak legs
* Blood spots on the skin
* Blurry vision
* Problems to speak

‐------------

**General Notes:** 

On my second day (her third) we went on a bike ride, normally we do 40-50 km, this time at 20 we were dying, I almost threw up. Usually, we try to push ourselves, however this time we listened to our body and understood that it has been at full throttle these last few days generating antibodies so we turned back and relaxed at the river.",1622336310.0,2021-05-29 17:58:30

It hurts to lift it slightly of to do simple tasks like fill my water bottle, or even a light graze with hurt. And it’s not just where the needle went in it’s my whole shoulder. I looked it up just to see what others have experienced and if this was normal (which I heard many had soreness after from my stepmom but this pain is unlike any soreness from a needle/vaccine previously) and if it would go away.

Any thoughts?",11,nnmm80,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nnmm80/hesitant_about_vaccine_because_i_have_been/,14,"I’m not anti-vax. Besides the problems I describe here, I am a healthy 43 yr old man who is not overweight.

For a year I have been dealing with rocking (boat-like) vertigo, head pressure, tinnitus, ear fullness and related issues. The major symptom, which I experience everyday, is the rocking vertigo. It is unpleasant, though it has improved, and some days it is much more tolerable than others. I’ve been to various specialists (vestibular therapist, eye doctor, etc.) and have had an MRI brain scan. Rocking vertigo is not that well understood and there’s not really standard treatment. I also have some auto-immune stuff - used to have IBS and I frequently get infection or inflammation of the lining over the heart or ribs (pericarditis or costro-condritis). 

Many people specifically report dizziness, tinnitus and similar as side effects of vaccine. That would be fine if it were just lasting a day or so. But it seems reasonable to me that these side effects could have a much more profound and lasting effect on someone who already has problems in that area that they’re trying to heal. 

That being the case, I have some real fear about this.

I understand that dizziness can be symptoms of Covid too, so it might be worse to catch Covid than to take vaccine. But it’s not like I would necessarily catch Covid, it’s just a possibility. 

If I did get the vaccine, I’d be very anxious about the resulting side effects. Just wondering if anyone with vertigo has gone through with it (though vertigo can differ quite a bit in terms of type and of etiology, so the experience of one person probably isn’t that generalizable).",1622320644.0,2021-05-29 13:37:24

Mods? Why did you take down my original post from an hour ago entitled - Update: 100 days out from Moderna = Neuropathy + Inflammation + Mental Health + Being a woman is ridiculous.,282,nn012x,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nn012x/mods_why_did_you_take_down_my_original_post_from/,180,"Note: Original post was removed, mods explained it was a mistake in the comments below. I am not able to update the title, thanks. 

Original text is as follows: 

Hi all. Yesterday I hit my 100 day mark from my first (and only) Moderna shot, so I figured I would give some updates. If you’ve seen my previous post you know that I had an *array* of side effects - most of them being around nerve/joint sensations, very heightened anxiety, and really poor sleep. Because of my array of symptoms my docs have *all* encouraged me not to get my second shot.

Updates:

Neuropathy: After a ton of tests, etc my neuro has landed on thinking that I have small fiber neuropathy post my first dose. I have a few more tests to confirm but all signs point to that. Small fiber neuropathy is basically inflammation of your sensory nerves = can cause burning, tingling, skin crawling, etc pain. Neuro mentioned that she has seen this in a number of her female patients btwn the ages of 20s-40s. The good news is: my large nerve fibers are fine and that the vast number of SFN cases resolve on their own - but it can take months. The other good news is that the frequency and intensity of my nerve issues (and muscle spasms) has definitely decreased and continuing to get better. It mostly peaks around Ovulation and my menstrual cycle (see again: being a woman is ridiculous).

Clot concern: As I mentioned previously, I have a genetic clotting disorder that has been well controlled for almost 20 years. I am on blood thinners for life. I had a PE and DVT before (almost 20 years ago) and this pain feels nothing like that. Blood clots feel like you are literally getting stabbed. My pain feels like nothing like this and all of my clotting bloodwork for me generally looks fine and is closely being monitored. I have had a ton of scans - no clots. 

Inflammation: Unfortunately, still dealing with some heightened inflammation (note: CRP normal, sed rate: elevated) Again, feel it the most around ovulation and my cycle. Hormones are all normal (AGAIN: BEING A WOMAN IS WILD) TSH is normal but on the lower side. My inflammation usually presents itself with neuropathy (especially in the hands, and weirdly my breasts and armpit). 

Mental Health: with the whirlwind of the last few months I found myself seriously in need of some mental health support. Found a wonderful psychiatrist and we have been doing CBT, which has been great in helping to bring down my anxiety and dealing with depression without meds. The mind is really powerful so it’s important to get yourself in the best mental position that you can, even when things are hard. bringing down my anxiety has helped some with my sleeping, but I am getting a sleep study soon and am super excited about that.

TLDR: I am getting better, slowly but surely. I have a solid number of antibodies from my first dose so I am monitoring it with my docs, and once another option (I’m hoping novavax!) becomes available - I may take that later down the line. 

Things that have helped me: Acupuncture for the nerve pain, Tylenol for the occasional headaches, and trying to get my sleep back in order, and honestly just time.

Thanks for all of the really kind messages that I’ve gotten since my last post, you guys have been very supportive and I really appreciate it. Wishing everyone good health! ❤️",1622243702.0,2021-05-28 16:15:02

5/28 - Very sore arm, it's hot and hard around the injection sight but no redness or bruising. lots of brain fog, depressed mood, dazed and out of it. Take a two hour nap at 3pm because I am so achey all up my back and into my hands (hurt to wring out a cloth). After nap feel a bit better, eat a little food, drink 1.5L over the course of the next few hours and feel way better. Tylenol as well. No more aches but chills just before bed.

5/29 - wake up feeling great, do some work at home, try to go for one of my daily 60min walks with my sister but I can't even walk and talk without feeling winded. Walk for only 20min and have to sit down as soon as I get home. Heart rate is normal, resting HR stayed at 68 post vaccine and during the walk it was 115-130 which is my normal brisk pace. HR after sitting down returned to 78 which is normal, but I still feel the need to take deep breaths/yawn but being unable too and now I am fatigued

5/30 Woke up feeling better, no depression anymore. Arm still sore, and hurt on every bump when I cycled for a bit. I still had the shortness of breath and had to stop and drink some water in the middle of my ride. Took it easy rest of the day.

Positive vaccination experience with history of myocarditis,31,nncko0,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nncko0/positive_vaccination_experience_with_history_of/,3,"24 year old male. Completed both shots of Moderna on Monday. Had myocarditis previously from Epstein Barr virus when I was 20 and was hospitalized so I was concerned about getting the second shot with all the reports coming out. Also have POTS and had to have an SVT ablated all due to that infection. 

After 4 days it doesn’t seem like I had any heart issues and just got the fever and bad body aches and skin sensitivity. Heart rate went to ~110 from the fever but nothing crazy. Did have some chest discomfort that made my lungs feel “raw” but I think it was from the full body aches/sensitivity. 

Figured I’d share my experience with anyone anxious.",1622280668.0,2021-05-29 02:31:08
Second Dose Side Effects- Should I see a doctor?,8,nnj0oz,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nnj0oz/second_dose_side_effects_should_i_see_a_doctor/,14,"I got my second dose of Pfizer a few weeks ago. About 18 hours after, I began to have bouts of chest pain that felt similar to how a heart attack is described. Jaw pain, a “toothache” feeling, squeezing chest pain, and shortness of breath (side note, it could have just been because I was in so much pain.) anyway, I came into the ER with an abnormally high blood pressure (140/80) - I’m a healthy 17 year old with perfect blood pressure for reference. My hospital did not investigate the issue as much as they should have. An EKG was performed, they told me it was normal, said it was side effects of the second dose, and I was sent home while I was still in severe pain. They did not perform any blood tests and my troponin levels, which indicate myocarditis, were not checked. 

The pain eventually subsided within a day but I’m now left wondering if I should go back in for a follow-up because it wasn’t fully investigated. However this was a few weeks ago and the chest pain is gone. my mom told me troponin doesn’t last that long and nothing would show up even if they tested it now. I don’t really know where to go from here? I feel like I wasn’t taken seriously and they ushered me out really quickly despite how empty the ER was. They wrote off my high blood pressure as “ER jitters.” My blood pressure is normal now and my chest feels fine, but do I have reason to believe I should get a follow-up? And what would I even ask them to check out? 

I would really appreciate some advice. I’m really freaking out about this whole thing. Thanks for reading.",1622305998.0,2021-05-29 09:33:18

Nothing happened during the waiting/observation period. 

8 hours later my arm started to hurt and the area around my vaccine site got tender. 

24 hours later- slightly sore lower back/hip (I have a chronic pain issue and it flaired slightly) pain in arm, area around vaccine side hard, swollen and tender. 

48 hours- small headache, arm less sore but area around vaccine site still tender, hard and swollen

72 hours- arm no longer sore. Vaccine site calmed down, no longer swollen, only very slightly tender

96 hours- all symptoms have resolved, though I do have a sore neck, but that could be from any number of things.  

The only odd things I’ve noticed is that since my vaccine, my heart rate seems to be slower. It usually is 100-115bmp while resting, and when I’ve taken it the past few days it’s been 90-100/bmp and that I’ve had some very minor leg pain, like in my calf muscles. It almost feels like when you are getting a Charlie horse but it goes away before it actually becomes a Charlie horse, if that makes sense. Minor muscle pain. 


My boyfriend just got his shot, moderna, today, May 28 at 4.20pm 
29/m slightly overweight, no other medical issues. 

No issues during waiting/observation time.

So I took the shot at 18.30, got home everything normal except for a sore arm (the shot HURT like a bitch, and this is coming from a pierced gal that isn't afraid of needles or anything. I literally felt the solution going in my muscles lol).

About an hour and a half later I got paracetamol so I wouldn't have to deal with side effects during the night. It did alleviate my sore arm for a while.

I went to sleep at about 23.00, I was exhausted. I usually don't sleep until 00.00 or later and I had no particular reason to be exhausted other than the shot.

At about 01.20 I woke up and felt my arm getting sore and numb. Prob the paracetamol wore off. Within minutes I was getting a headache and shivers and my whole body was trembling like a fish. I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn't so I took my temperature (38.5° Celsius). I took two more pills.

It's currently 03.55 and the fever finally went down (it took two hours) and I'm going back to sleep feeling proud that I got the shot and did my part in kicking covid's ass.

The State of the Subreddit.,40,nn5sbj,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nn5sbj/the_state_of_the_subreddit/,154,"Hello everyone,

As most of you have been aware over the past few months, the subreddit has grown more than 2 fold since I have become a moderator.

This growth in community has come with a lot of problems including the main issue of trolls and users brigading from conspiracies subreddits. Because of the anonymity of the internet, it is very difficult for us to determine who is a genuine user, and who is not.

Help us. Report when things don’t seem right. Upvote the genuine posts, downvote posts that are not relevant.

This has been working for a while and we have been able to filter out almost all of the malicious users and then manually approve the positive ones. Unfortunately, the past month or two has shown that certain members of the community will go to sad and extreme lengths to circumvent bans and post misinformation.

This subreddit was made for the open discussion of the vaccine and people’s experiences of being vaccinated. Unfortunately, it has recently became a place where it seems as soon as there is a “new” symptom that someone has experienced that may or may not have been related to their vaccination, then it seems everyone also has had this symptom.

Like others have pointed out, a lot of these stories are false anecdotes that are there purely to scare people into not getting the vaccine. Notice how 1 week it’s everyone talking about late periods and now all of a sudden everyone has Myocarditis? Where were all of these people with this things 3 months ago… 6 months ago?

Now, it would seem that it would just be as well to delete all these posts about symptoms, right? Well, not quite that simple … This subreddit is for the open discussion of vaccinations. Good experiences and bad experiences alike. WE DO NOT CENSOR ANYTHING UNLESS IT IS MISINFORMATION THAT IS DEEMED HARMFUL.

I am a paramedic and I have not seen a single person that has had a bad reaction to a vaccine myself, other than a fever. Now, that’s not to say there isn’t people suffering with side effects, or even a minority suffering with severe side effects. But the fact is, the benefits of the vaccines still hugely outweigh the risks.

We, as mods, have well over 2000 items in our modqueue, and it’s growing exponentially. Filled with brand new accounts calling us Nazis, or that we are war criminals.

This is not acceptable. We will, and have, reported these accounts the Reddit Administrators. Many of whom have had action taken against them.

We do not work for “Big Vaccine”, Fauci does not pay my wages. I wish someone would pay me for doing this because honestly? It’s exhausting recently.

But we’ll keep going. Because we believe that open and HONEST discussion should be allowed. It is very disappointing when we have numerous people circumventing bans in order to spread nonsense conspiracy theories as if they were fact.

We want to keep this subreddit an open and safe space to discuss. But we can’t do that without our communities support.

Report when things don’t seem right. Upvote the genuine posts, downvote posts that are not relevant.

We all need to do this.

Is this why I smell bad after my vaccine?

I just want to understand what's happening to me and share my thoughts. Please feel to correct me if anything is bs. I'm VERY positive about covid vaccines and I don't see my experience as any bad.

So, I made a post some hours ago asking if I'm experiencing a side effect of vaccine (BioNTech). My symptoms: smelly urine with increased leukocytes, bad body odour. Well, I think all of my body fluids either smell or taste kind of bad (including saliva). I have read that some, especially young people have similar symptoms after the actual disease.

Leukocytes in urine can mean the body is fighting against some kind of infection. I though at first, maybe UTI? But I don't have any other symptoms. And I have had some UTIs before. This is not how it feels like.

Next thought - is it maybe really from the vaccine? My immune system is strong and produces many leukocytes to help fight intruders. When the white blood cells do their job and die, they need to be excreted somehow. And my thought is they can get in all kinds of body fluids. Dead leukocytes are practically pus. And pus doesn't smell good.

tl;dr I smell bad because my body fluids smell after pus and it is a sign my body is creating a good immunity against corona virus. Sounds crazy?",1622274500.0,2021-05-29 00:48:20

Thoughts on the heart related issues and symptoms from the vaccines,13,nmzzfd,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmzzfd/thoughts_on_the_heart_related_issues_and_symptoms/,19,"I've posted a few times on this sub in response to the various heart issues that people have been experiencing, and wanted to share my perspective and get other's thoughts on some of the potential causes (even though we won't know for a while since we are still learning about the reactions folks are having). Sorry in advance for how long this post is but I wanted to share the details of my experience, so it is a bit long winded. 

33F, 132 lbs, no major health issues aside from infrequent SVTs. After my first shot on 4/24, I initially only had a sore arm and some light fatigue. About 24 hours later, I experienced an SVT attack where my HR shot up to 140 at rest and took about 10 minutes to normalize. After that, I noticed that my resting HR was higher than usual and doing light chores pushed my HR into the ""fat burning zone"" on my fitbit. I checked in w/ my cardiologist and she said this was probably just my body's response to the infection. This continued but slowly started to improve (my HR started to slowly calm down) but then about 10 days after the shot I had a night where I had terrible insomnia and felt a strange tingling up and down my spine and into my brain that felt like electric shocks. The next day, I had a worse SVT attack and I called the paramedics who got me to the ED. They ran bloodwork and tests and all came back normal, and my HR eventually came down on its own. The ED doc said that they hadn't seen this reaction yet and that he didn't see any issues with me getting the second shot (echoed by my PCP). My resting HR eventually ended up coming down so my symptoms resolved after about 14 days. The only lingering side effect was that my HR is higher during exercise, so I have been taking it easy and focusing on low impact activities like walking and yoga until my follow-up appointment with my cardiologist. 

Even though I was dreading it and uncertain, I did end up getting the second shot on 5/26. That evening, I experienced some heart fluttering but did some yoga and breathing exercises to try and calm myself down. My resting HR increased again by about 20 bpm, and was higher doing chores, etc. but less intense than last time. I'm now about 36 hours post shot and feeling ok and better than I did the first time around. I think that being vigilant about taking Tylenol, eating an anti-inflammatory diet (starting a few days before the shot), and drinking tons of Pedialyte has helped...but who knows. 

I have been obsessively following this sub to see if others are having heart issues because my doctors all seemed surprised by my symptoms and said they weren't typical. From what I gathered, there are quite a few people who have experienced an increase in HR or even spikes in HR, higher blood pressure, etc. From all the comments, it seems like there's generally four categories that are NOT anxiety related...

Dehydration / Electrolyte Imbalance - My cardiologist mentioned that dehydration can cause a loss in blood volume which causes your heart to pump faster, although she didn't think that it would cause the SVT. I got my electrolyte panel checked at the ED and it all looked normal. A lot of folks have posted that taking Magnesium supplements (check out the Calm one) have helped them regulate their heart rate. 

Thyroid / Hormone Issues - The ED and PCP checked my thyroid (which came back normal) because hyperthyroidism can cause a higher heart rate or palpitations. I've seen one or two folks post on here that they were diagnosed with Hashimoto Disease (thyroid related) post vaccine and it had never been an issue for them before. With all the stories of disrupted menstrual cycles, it sounds like this vaccine can impact our hormonal balance which could relate to heart rate issues. 

Allergic Reactions - I've seen a few posts on people who were fine the day of the shot, but seemed to have a delayed allergic reaction a few days later (itching skin, higher HR) that resolved when they took a Benadryl. I was hoping that would fix the issue for me, but unfortunately Benadryl did nothing for my high HR. 

Heart Inflammation - I think this is where I fit. A lot of the weird reactions to the vaccines seem to be inflammatory responses outside of the normal fever, muscle pain, etc. because our bodies all respond differently. We are just now hearing more stories of Myocarditis and Pericarditis post vaccine. Not sure what makes people more prone to heart inflammation (seems to be happening a lot in younger males). I have been way more vigilant with anti-inflammatories this time and also eating an anti-inflammatory diet. Hoping that this round continues to be easier than the last. 

Long story short - I am not a doctor, but have talked to quite a few doctors over the past weeks about my HR issues post vaccine so just sharing the feedback they provided me. For anyone who is being told your issues are anxiety related, it is possible but also don't rule out these other potential issues and get checked out by your doctor. We are all responding to this vaccine differently so take care of yourselves - you know your body better than anyone else : )",1622243567.0,2021-05-28 16:12:47

Gonna be recording my experience on J&J aka Jansen aka Johnson & Johnson since there is a lot of postings out there. M/38/not pregnant/not menstruating.,6,nmw9hl,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmw9hl/gonna_be_recording_my_experience_on_jj_aka_jansen/,8,"This post is mostly because I don't see a lot of experience reports on J&J since Emergent had the whole investigation thing. [I decided to take the plunge](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AllClassicCavy.webp) (not an easy decision) and since I did, maybe I can save someone else the head ache of having to decide or not with my own experience. 

I apologize for the J&J aka Jansen aka Johnson & Johnson, but it will make it [easier for someone else to find this post if they search it.](https://i.imgur.com/7YUkOH9.jpg) 

I just got the shot at 1 PM in Northern California. Walked into an empty Rite aid, asked for it. Told them I didn't have insurance (I do but its high deductible so I always pay cash), they told me to fill out a paper and have a seat. I did so. about 15 minutes later they gave me the shot. Asked me to wait 15 so I did. Felt fine and left. No charge. 

Like others have said the shot itself doesn't hurt but the injection was a [mild discomfort](https://i.imgur.com/O3bnnMR.jpg). My arm feels fine now. I don't feel anything other than relief from getting it over with. I was reading this sub hourly looking for new experiences and checking the news daily to see if any new reports on Emergent and J&J.

Stocked up on pedialytes, and cleaned a bit. Writing this now. Still feel fine. Been drinking lots of water. 

A bit of background: I DID NOT want to get this vaccine yet. I am not [anti-vax](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/anencephaly.html). I just love the 6 foot distance life and the mask life. I spent a large portion of my childhood trying to imitate [Clint Eastwood](https://i.imgur.com/BGtLz70.gif) and therefore have a resting ugly face. I love the mask. I will continue to wear one even after this is all over with. 

The main thing that pushed me into getting it was a trip I ended up booking. I am going on a trip in July to a [small Alaska town](https://i.imgur.com/06BLtfR.jpg) that is a bit strict about it. My room mate for the trip also works with high risk people and asked me to get vaccinated. I felt I didn't have a choice. The [peer pressure was immense](https://media1.tenor.com/images/dd1ce057705e00813a4d460ea67956fc/tenor.gif?itemid=17244638) and kind of pissed me off. I see their point that everyones wants everyone to get vaccinated asap, but I don't like being called anti-vax or crazy just because I want to wait to see what vaccine ends up being the best one and lease complicated. 

Why did I pick J&J? I am actually an [investor in J&J](https://i.imgur.com/EFqRbev.jpg) and very aware of their reputation such as them being fully aware of asbestos in the baby powder they were selling. To be fair, these issues don't bother me. 

I am also well aware of the issues with Emergent. THIS bothered me and turned me off of J&J. I had no issues getting the J&J vaccine until this news broke back in April. When that happened I ended up finding this sub and reading everything. This news broke like a week or two after I booked my trip. Lol. I told myself I would wait as long as I possibly could to see what would end up happening. 

I was really hoping on news that Emergent cleaned up their process and shipped out brand new, [uncontaminated vaccines](https://i.imgur.com/SF42MLn.jpg) to everywhere. But I can't find such news, and if I wait any long I am not going to be able to get over the side effects before my trip. 

Most of my co workers got the Pfiezer vaccine which was the other one I was thinking of getting. But one of them had a severe reaction to it and was pretty sick for almost a week. I'm also very busy and traveling a lot and [it just seems like a huge hassle to have a two shot process to me.](https://i.imgur.com/uC6G1.jpg)  I just want to be done with it and have it over with. 

All right so back to recording.

Around 5 PM and I started making dinner. Some Spaghetti with a tomato butternut squash sauce and shrimp. Once it was done and I started to eat I started to feel a bit... ""high."" I think it's the sign of a fever coming on. But I'm not really in any discomfort. Gonna check my temperature. 

Realizing now I should have taken my temperature before all this but I was at work and trying to occupy myself after. Oh well. 

Checked temperature after searching around for 15 minutes for the thermometer at 6 PM. 98.5. Think I am fine. 

Decided I needed to occupy myself rather than scroll through reddit so started playing some 4 way chess and the high feeling disappeared. Might of been a placebo effect. Who knows. 7:40 PM and still feeling fine. Temperature is 98.
It is now 4:30 AM the following day. (Day 2 - 15 hours after getting the shot). I still feel great. Temp is at 98.1. I woke up at 2:30 am which is my normal time for waking up and did my normal routine. 

I think I should note that when I fell asleep I was exhausted, but my mind was having ""intense"" random thoughts. Almost like I was trying to dream already even though I had just shut my eyes. It made me wake up a few times and try to tell my brain to shut up which worked and I fell asleep. 

I do have to say there is a slight concern that I am not having much reaction. I know that getting a fever is a good thing. I am 99 percent sure I had covid around the time they started locking down the airports, as I had a two week ordeal where I couldn't breathe and felt like death which I recovered from with no lasting effects. I didn't get tested at the time as hospitals were jammed packed and most private doctors weren't seeing anyone. 

I'll continue to update daily for a week and then after that for the next month if anything significant happens worth recording. 

TLDR; I got the J&J Vaccine, I'll update daily for a week and then for a month if anything worth noting happens. Ask anything you want. It was Emergent that kept me away for so long, not J&J and not the vaccine itself.",1622231941.0,2021-05-28 12:59:01

Assuming that our second-round shots might take us down, we actually staggered our shots. My daughter and I went first and my husband a week later. 

Again, the shot itself was fine. Didn't hurt. A few hours after my shot I felt mildly tired, but nothing unbearable. Again, when I got home, I iced my arm for about an hour as did my daughter.

The day after the shot, I was worse. My symptoms included:

1. Fever
2. Chills
3. Mild nausea
4. Fatigue
5. Extreme body aches
6. Sore arm and red mark where my shot was

I mostly laid in bed and drank A LOT of water. My fever reached 101. I had already taken 4 ibuprofen, so I didn't want to take any more. I made myself a hot cup of water with fresh shredded ginger, freshly shredded turmeric, mint leaves from my garden, and some honey. I call it my ""turmeric ginger tea"" even though there are no tea leaves in it. I drank that over a few hours and rested/slept off and on all day and my temperature was back to normal by around 9 pm. 

I felt fine the next day. However, I had some ""brain fog."" I felt like I couldn't quite concentrate, and like I'd taken a sleep aid that wouldn't wear off. That lasted for a few days. 

My daughter was fine with the exception of being a little tired and having a sore arm. 

A week later my husband got his shot. He was fine. Sore arm the next day and just fatigued. Mild fever. No aches and pains. He just rested but wasn't as bad off as I was. He was fine the next day.

Congestion (allergy) after covid vaccine,7,nmw45c,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmw45c/congestion_allergy_after_covid_vaccine/,5,"I have been waking up in the middle of the night congested from what seems like a pollen or dust allergy for the past couple of weeks, off and on. There are days where I can’t get back to sleep for hours, and days where I have slept fine. This is unusual for me, as I normally sleep well. 

I’ve had dust and pollen related runny nose and congestion, or something akin to hay fever allergies, my whole life. When I mow the lawn, or do a lot of cleaning or gardening, it’s worse, but it’s never woken me up in the middle of the night after taking medicine. Normally, I’d take a Zyrtec before the activity, or a Benadryl after, and be fine. 

Last couple of weeks I have woken up to severe congestion and a runny nose that just won’t stop. It keeps me awake and nothing seems to help. Benadryl has a small effect, but can’t get me back to sleep, and Zyrtec seems useless. 

I got the second Moderna shot 2 weeks ago, and am just now wondering if there may be some connection. Anyone else have these symptoms? I’m starting to get concerned that this is going to be a new long term issue for me.

Also NHS: ""If you received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, you should get your second shot 3 weeks (or 21 days) after your first. If you received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, you should get your second shot 4 weeks (or 28 days) after your first.""

M/41 on lisinopril and lercanidipin, received J&J shot yesterday around 1100. Nothing happened until 1800 that day when I started to feel usual symptoms, cold, body ache, tiredness... Went to sleep, and one hour later woke up a bit worse. Around 2100 I can barely move, I'm cold, mild but constant headaches. I had just one 400 mg ibuprofen, and the headache was gone. I was constantly hydrating, had good appetite and ate good, and around midnight went to sleep. Still cold and shaking, turned up heating but couldn't sleep for 2 more hours. Then around 2 am a weird thing happened, like someone did hard reset on me. It was kicking my ass for a straight 8 hours and all of a sudden everything stopped, just like that. No cold, no fever, nothing. Shortly after I fell a sleep. 
Woke up this morning, everything all right, fresh and ready for work. If anything new happened, I will update the post.

Are there any others going through the same situation? What have your doctors recommended if you can’t get the second dose?

21 Years old. Male. 

So at the end of April, I got my first dose of the moderna vaccine. I only had very minimal side effects. Headache, fatigue, sore arm, etc... Nothing that wasn't unbearable. 

2nd dose of the moderna on the 27th of may at around noon. The initial response was nothing major. This time I didnt initially have a headache. Later on that night, I started getting a really bad headache. I had to stop what I was doing and go home. I went in the house and laid down, and couldnt hardly move a muscle. It felt like I had the flu. 

The symptoms within the hour became so bad that I started shaking, I had a small fever, I could hardly walk and could barely talk. I knew something wasnt right and had someone run me to the ER. There is where I found out that my heart rate was over 140, my head was throbbing, and I could barely sit still because I was shaking really bad. 

They did bloodwork and only found my white blood cells slightly elevated, and my fever was 101 degrees farenheit. They ruled out any heart problems with an EKG and said that I had a moderate reaction to the 2nd vaccine dose. They told me that in a few days, everything will subside. 

They discharged me still with a fever and with my pulse still at 140. As of now, I still have a bad headache, my heart is still beating fast and I'm still very weak. 

This vaccine really did a number on my the second time around, but I hope that doesnt discourage anyone from getting it. I just want other to have information in regards to more moderate side effects. 

TLDR; Went to the ER the same day I got my 2nd vaccine dose. Bad headache, elevated pulse,  fever and shaking. They ruled out any other health problems and told me I had a moderate reaction to the 2nd vaccine dose. They discharged me within a few hours and told me everything will subside in a few days.",1622214527.0,2021-05-28 08:08:47

First shot I got 4/7, last day of my actual flow. Spotted next few days like normal. 

Second I got 5/8, second day of period. I had a scare because I stopped bleeding and cramping for like 2-3 hours the same day. After that, business as usual. 

Now I started my period 2 days early which isn’t unusual for me. And it’s been feeling pretty normal!

I wanted to focus on periods in particular because obviously there hasn’t been thorough research about it. When I read women’s horror stories here I got really bad anxiety and actually almost didn’t get my 2nd shot because of it. I chose to bite the bullet because in the end of the day I wanted to keep me and my guests safe for the event.

First shot: my arm hurt like hell and I felt like I couldn’t really sleep because of it or move it very much. The next day about, 24 hours later, I started feeling kind of dizzy and tired and out of it but that only lasted for a few hours. Arm felt totally normal in about two or three days.

Second shot: arm hurt a lot less and the actual shot was administered a lot better. Felt a tiny bit sore/achy/tired the next morning but I also stayed up late working on a project so could have been from that. Honestly wouldn’t have noticed if I wasn’t looking for any symptoms. Arm stopped bothering me after I used it a bit (by late morning it was totally fine)

I was feeling fine throughout the day with no side effects. Because I thought I was good, I went out for some drinks. At around 10:00 that night, things took a turn for the worst. 

I got the chills, which worried my friends as the place was objectively hot. I went home, now having chills, sweats, fever, headache, nausea, and shortness of breath. I vomited and then tried to get to sleep without much success. 

Eventually it became morning and I had a big headache, fever, chills/sweats, and shortness of breath. I assumed these were normal symptoms, so I just tried to rest. I would have spasms of shortness of breath, where it would hurt to breath and I would hyperventilate, making my heart race. These would last about an hour and a half. I will call these “attacks” from here on out. Outside of that, all normal. 

Monday I woke up with chest pain. Most of the other symptoms were either gone or way down, but my upper body was sore. I assumed this was just residual discomfort and moved on. It was a pretty good day. 

Monday night I woke up middle of the night drenched in my own sweat, freezing, headache, struggling to breathe. This would be the first of a few “attacks” to come my way - I got back to sleep, then it happened again in the morning. Due for the fact that my side effects worsened from Monday to Tuesday, I went to the ER. 

In the ER, they performed a couple of tests. My ekg was normal, blood pressure was normal, etc. and most things were good. One thing that stood out to the doctors though was elevated levels of troponin. For those who do not know, this protein is found primarily in the muscles of the heart. It should have a reading of 0.0, as it is should not be in your blood. My reading was over 8 (unsure of units), which was high. They admitted me and diagnosed me with myocarditis. 

My level dropped throughout the day as low as 5ish, but I had another attack prior to going to sleep. This attack came with a higher level of chest pain than usual, so they gave me morphine and I eventually stabilized. They rechecked my levels and I was at 9. These attacks - likely caused by the inflamed heart - would put additional pressure on my heart , and make it worse. This is the problem with this condition - sometimes it just gets better over time, other times things degrade. Luckily for me, I have not had an attack since Tuesday and am set to be discharged today (Thursday) as my levels are back down. An echocardiogram (sonogram of heart) revealed no structural damage, and upon discharge I am set to rest and try to to get my heart rate up. 

(Note: I have no underlying medical conditions)

Edit: the units used for the protein in this post and all comments are ng/mL.",1622148557.0,2021-05-27 13:49:17

Chest tightness after Moderna ~30M,4,nmsiiz,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmsiiz/chest_tightness_after_moderna_30m/,7,"I've got first dose of Moderna week ago. I had fairly severe side effects for first 3 days (chills, fever, muscle pain etc.) and after some research I did - it was expected since I had COVID at least once (I'd say twice, but there was no COVID in my region when I got severely covid-like ill first time). One COVID complication came back for few days like numbness in heels (has to sound funny, but problems with circulation apart from pain was impeding my ability to walk).  
My case seems to be similar to [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmeq1v/my_experience_possible_bad_reaction_30m/) except some people shrugged off u/deathyon1 just by saying that he should have a healthier life style (I doubt that's helpful here). I never smoked and only thing I do is drink 0,5 or 1 pint of beer 2 times a week.

Most of that is gone now, apart from tightness in the left side of chest that is constant. I take single aspirin daily (thinking about taking it more often) and that alleviates that feeling a little bit, as it should thin out blood a little. I drink a lot of water etc. I'm kina having second thoughts about second dose, but I want that vax passport in the EU, so I'll just have to pull through somehow. Now I understand why 2 million people didn't go for their second dose here.

I'm wondering about two things:  
Did anyone had this and can I expect this to stop after some time just like other side effects? Found some info about Myocarditis and that doesn't sound too great. I would rather skip the doctor visit, because ones that are easy to get appointment with are really incompetent (last one gave me \*PERSCRIPTION\* for supermarket vitamin D and magnesium) and to get to the good ones it can take weeks.  
If you had COVID, are second dose side effects as bad(or worse) as first dose ones?",1622216425.0,2021-05-28 08:40:25

"(30F, autoimmune issues) my Pfizer experience...10 days later with weird itching/rash and tachycardia",46,nmbiea,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmbiea/30f_autoimmune_issues_my_pfizer_experience10_days/,32,"I should note that I was diagnosed with severe POTS like 3-4 years ago after a horrible reaction to a medication. It put me in a wheelchair for almost a year and I haven't been right ever since, however my POTS has mostly been in remission for about 1-2 years. I'm a 95lb Caucasian female, 30 years old, if that matters. Not anti-vaxx in any way shape or form. I have POTS, IBS with tons of food allergies and sensitivities, and possible mild Crohn's but my test results were inconclusive. Not on any medications, I just take a daily probiotic.

Had my first Pfizer about 10 days ago. No big deal. Really sore arm the next day, felt tired and temp was slightly elevated for a couple hours. Some dizziness. It passed completely in 2-3 days and I was fine.

About 7 days post-vaxx, I started to have random itching and light rashes appearing on my body off and on throughout the day. I mean everywhere: my scalp, ears, calf, feet, arms, totally random places. When one place stopped itching, another would start. I chalked it up to cottonwood allergies, but been a little suspicious since I've never had this symptom before. My allergies have always caused congestion, headache, fatigue, and dizzy spells, never skin itchiness and certainly not this bad. It's been driving me kind of insane. As I'm typing this I'm just itching all over. Can't prove this is from the vaccine, but it's worth mentioning.

8 days post-vaxx, I woke up with tachycardia. I'm very diligent about drinking 2 litres of water a day so I know it's not dehydration. It lasted all freaking day and night. Had to cut my walk short because I was out of breath and my chest was tight. Could feel my heart pounding and got exhausted half-way through the day. Laid down and my HR was still hovering between 85-110 until about 2am, when it finally went down to 75-85...still high but at least I could sleep. My normal RHR is about 65.

I have not had an episode of tachycardia this bad in like 2 years. And no, it's not ""anxiety"". I've been living with anxiety for 20+ years, I know how it affects me and this ain't it chief.

It is now day 9, tachycardia has improved but still not great. Still itchy. Otherwise feel fine except for some really vague occasional soreness at the injection site that comes and goes. Again, can't prove that either of these symptoms are even related to the vaccine. But the fact that I've never had this itching before and my POTS had been in remission for 2 whole-ass years is pretty sus. ANY immune reaction can trigger POTS, so I half-expected this and fully accepted it as a risk when I chose to go in and get vaxxed.

**Overall I'm really glad I got the 1st dose but I probably won't be getting the second one**. I know Covid would also aggravate my POTS and possibly kill me, but I read that 1 dose is enough to keep you out of the hospital so I think I'm good. 80% efficacy is good enough in my eyes. I might be willing to get a booster in the future if my symptoms clear up. I'm very diligent about wearing a mask and not going anywhere I don't have to. I have severe medical PTSD from my experience with POTS and being wheelchair-bound for a year, never knowing if I'll walk again. Not interested in going through that a second and third time, thanks.

The vast, vast majority of people will not have the issues I have. **I literally don't know a single person IRL who had side effects from the vaccine, not even mild ones.** I'm the one outlier in my entire family. Again, I have complex medical issues and a loooong history of negative reactions to medications and flu vaccines. If you're on the fence, there's a 99.999% chance you'll be fine, but I have to post my experience for the sake of honesty.

Just thought I'd add my little experience and I'll update if anything new happens.

Follow up: overall positive experience despite initial adverse reaction,7,nmnrvx,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmnrvx/follow_up_overall_positive_experience_despite/,4,"22 F - A little while ago I made a post outlining weird symptoms I experienced following my 2nd Pfizer shot. My main complaints were chest pain, heart fluttering, joint pain, muscle aches, and feeling like I had an irregular heartbeat. These symptoms were bad enough that I sought help at an urgent care clinic - they found nothing wrong except for a very fast resting heart rate (sinus tachycardia). I received a steroid and anti-inflammatory shot.

I’m happy to report that my symptoms are entirely gone now. While it was terrifying and painful to go through this for 1.5-2 weeks, I’m entirely back to normal now. Not sure if my symptoms were related to the vaccine or not, but I’ve never had any other issues like this in my life. Either way, they PASSED! My assumption is that my body experienced an extreme inflammatory response to the vaccine, which could be controlled with the shots I was given (this is not confirmed by a medical professional though, just my assumption).

If you’re currently experiencing similar symptoms, there is hope out there it may just go away on its own after some time and/or improve!!!",1622197910.0,2021-05-28 03:31:50

"My Experience, Possible Bad Reaction (30M)",21,nmeq1v,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmeq1v/my_experience_possible_bad_reaction_30m/,23,"This is just my personal experience/story and I fully encourage everyone to get the vaccine.


I got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on January 26th. I was eligible to get it earlier than most people because of where I work. I followed the instructions they gave us and was able to get signed up. 


As a side note, someone I know works for a company that has been working on a COVID antibody test since last year and by this time in January they had already started running the tests with samples from real people. What he told me was that when they ran the antibody tests on people who had been vaccinated vs. people who got the virus and recovered, it broke the tests. What they were seeing was that when they ran the test on someone who had received their first dose of vaccine, the test results were coming back basically off the charts positive. The chemical reaction to the presence of antibodies was so high that the analyzer was unable to read the results. Since I'm not a scientist and all I wasn't sure what that means. I asked him if I should be worried about that or anything and he said no, that his point was just that he's unsure why we need a second dose since the first dose already seems to be working really well. I didn't really worry about it and went ahead with getting the vaccine.


I got my first dose and everything went well. The lady who gave me the first shot really jabbed the needle deep into my arm so it was pretty sore right away. Other than the sore arm though, I didn't notice any other side effects or have any other issues. 


After some time though, and I'm not sure exactly how long since 4 months have passed, I started to not feel well. The fact that I wasn't feeling well is complicated by the fact that I had developed a cough a few months earlier where I hack up nasty brown spots after I switched from smoking marijuana to vaping concentrates for a couple of months. At first I thought it was a good sign maybe, my lungs clearing out all the crap I put in there from smoking, but then when it just kept going I started to get a little concerned. So I had stopped using the vape in December or very beginning of January and was considering going to see someone about the stuff I'd been coughing up, but didn't want to do so until after I was vaccinated. Meanwhile, between my first and second dose I had started having what I thought must be heartburn. It started as a sort of stabbing, muscle cramp sort of pain in the right side of my chest below my sternum. I've never had issues with heartburn up to this point and I wasn't 100% sure that's what it was but decided to start taking pepcid to try and relieve it. I took the pepcid basically everyday for a few weeks but it didn't really seem to help much, if at all.


On February 16th I got my second dose. They didn't jab me so deep this time which I appreciated and I felt totally fine until about an hour after when my shoulder started to hurt pretty bad. That night and for about half of the next day I felt really tired and a little achy like I was actually sick. By the end of the next day though I was over it.


I still however was not feeling 100%. I was still coughing up that crap I attributed to vaping, and the heartburn sort of pain was still ongoing. I also started noticing a little bit of pain/discomfort in other areas of my chest and back. Sometimes my left shoulder blade felt achy, sometimes the right side of my chest, and sometimes in the center of my back. I was starting to think all of this must be from having really bad posture/sitting at my desk all day with little exercise.


About 3 weeks after my second dose I had the first of several episodes of something still undiagnosed. I was laying in bed smoking a joint with my girlfriend and eating a sandwich when I started having a bit of a coughing fit. Then all of a sudden my chest got really tight. Especially this sort of belt like tightness that was wrapping around the right side of my ribcage. I checked my pulse with a pulse oximiter we have at home and it was crazy high, up as high as 175 and hovering around 150. I wondered if this was a heart attack or about to be one. I told my girlfriend I'm not sure, but I think we might need to go the ER. She said she didn't think I was having a heart attack and to try to calm down first and also to talk to call parents and see what they think. My parents told me the same thing basically, that I was probably just freaking out or something and to lie down. I tried to not freak out and take it easy and after about an hour and a half the chest pain/tightness eased up as my heart rate went down. I already had a giant bottle of aspirin because by this point I had already been worrying about the chest pains, so I took several just in case and tried to get some sleep.


I called a doctor about it first thing the next day and he had me go in and do an EKG. The EKG came back normal except for Bradycardia which may be normal for me, although I am not an athlete and have been pretty sedentary lately. The doctor said he suspected I had an episode of atrial flutter and made it sound like something that wasn't too serious. He set me up to schedule holter monitor to investigate further. I still have not followed up with the holter monitor.


I ended up calling another doctor a couple of days later and brought up the coughing that started before all of this. I was wondering if maybe I actually had  a lung issue and not a heart problem. That doctor sent me to do a chest xray. The chest xray showed that my lungs had hyperinflation and the doctor said this was seen a lot in smokers, but that she didn't see anything to worry about as far as pneumonia or lung cancer or anything like that. I assumed that much be my issue and that I should just stop smoking and let me lungs heal.


I never gave up smoking pot 100% but I cut back big time and started using edibles. The chest pain/discomfort seemed to improve a little but it varied from day to day. About a month after the first episode though I had another. This time I had an aching/throbbing pain on the left side of my chest that felt like I was having palpitations/tachycardia. I was still concerned about everything going on so I called another doctor the next day and made an appoint me see someone in office the following Monday.


The doctor on the phone was completely unhelpful, he basically just told me that I was fine and there was nothing wrong with my heart. The doctor I saw in the office the following Monday was even more dismissive. I explained that I was having chest pains as previously described, along with all over chest tightness and feeling short of breath. He wrote me off as just having anxiety immediately and told me the anxiety was what was causing all my chest pain/breathlessness/and palpitations. I went home feeling defeated, knowing that it's not just anxiety but not sure what else to do.


The next week was the worst. I had really bad breathlessness that was lasting all day along with the all over chest tightness and discomfort in different places. I started wondering if I had developed asthma or if maybe I was just having panic attacks from working too much overtime. I made some edibles at one point and my heart rate went up to 130 and I spent hours feeling like I couldn't get enough oxygen and wondering if I am about to have heart attack. Over the next couple of weeks I just tried not to worry and take better care of myself. Things did settle down eventually.


I started taking CBD to see if that might help. It seemed to help so I've been taking it for a few weeks now. Yesterday however was another bad day. I was having the chest pains on my left side on and off since the night before or so. I decided I'd try talking to another doctor and talked to someone over the phone. This doctor took me more seriously and really listened to me. After listening to everything I had she said it was probably not a heart issue, but that I should follow through with the holter monitor on account of the tachycardia and stuff to be sure. She order some blood tests for me to do also.


I ended up making some edibles instead of smoking around dinner time. I felt like I had eaten too much afterwards though. I used basically the same amount of concentrates that I had used to make edibles with two times earlier this week, but this time my heart started racing again and I was having intermittent chest tightness/discomfort in all the usual places and worrying that I'm about to have heart attack. I feel a bit better today but with the same weird chest tightness lingering.


I only just today heard about the Myocarditis reactions to the vaccines. I started connecting dots and wondering if that's what I'm experiencing. I decided to post here and see if I can get any feedback from people who know they had a bad reaction. I'm not sure if it's even worth bringing this up with the doctors again since they've mostly been not worried about my heart and my EKG was normal and they didn't see anything on the chest xray. My plan right now is to just continue taking it easy unless things get worse.


Even though I've been feeling crappy since, I still think everyone should get vaccinated and I'd rather be dealing with this crap than having complications from COVID.",1622170709.0,2021-05-27 19:58:29
I’ve been experiencing odd on and off chest pain since first shot of Pfizer. Help.,37,nma68w,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nma68w/ive_been_experiencing_odd_on_and_off_chest_pain/,34,"32 M. 

The chest pain I am experiencing is best described as a dull pain centered in between and sometimes around my pectoral muscles. Sometimes I feel it on the right side sometimes it is on the side where my heart is. I’m not experiencing the pain that others are talking about when they lie down at night or are sitting in different positions oddly. My pain comes and goes for no reason throughout the day and sometimes I feel it gives me shortness of breath but I don’t know if that’s anxiety being induced after I feel a little of this chest pain. I’m still able to do all of the things I normally did before but it is very odd to have this dull pain come and go. It started a few days after the shot and it’s been two weeks now. 

Additionally, if I press around my pectorals, it sometimes is tender. Could it just be bad inflamed lymph nodes lasting this long? It doesn’t make sense to feel that in my heart though does it?

Anyone else? Is this myocarditis because I’m not seeing it line up perfectly with those symptoms. Thanks.",1622158673.0,2021-05-27 16:37:53
Moderna first dose - vomiting leading to seizure and hospitalization.,95,nm44ke,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nm44ke/moderna_first_dose_vomiting_leading_to_seizure/,34,"TLDR: My mom's Moderna experience (Late 50sF), not mine. She got vaccinated Thursday, diarrhea Friday, Saturday to Monday no symptoms, Tuesday and Wednesday throwing up and chills. Wednesday night - seizure. She almost certainly had a very severe form of Covid March 2020.

* She got her vaccine last Thursday afternoon. 

* No symptoms Thursday or Friday other than the sore injection area. 

* Saturday she has some diarrhea but nothing serious. Tuesday morning comes round, she wakes up feeling kinda lousy, muscle pain in the legs

* Tuesday afternoon starts vomiting every half hour, completely unable to keep anything down - Not even water. Lightheaded.

* Tuesday night was ok, eats some cheerios and some yogurt, keeps it down.

* Wednesday morning, she feels a bit better, but hungry and lightheaded. Eats a few biscuits, and bread and some cheerios, anything for some quick calories. Drinking a lot of water. Some chills

* Wednesday afternoon. Throws up only a couple times through the afternoon. Chills get worse. 

* Wednesday evening, chills subside but she throws up again, she has a Pepto bismol at 9.45, doesn't throw up again, goes to bed around 12.

* Around 1am, I hear a loud bang, I think it's the shower curtain in my bathroom falling (happens sometimes) so I ignore it. The about 45 seconds later, I hear her walking thinking it was her getting woken up by the sound. I say don't worry about it, it's the shower curtain. I don't get a response which was odd. 

* I go to her room and see that she is on the ground, saying she was feeling light headed and wanted to sit down because she was feeling dizzy. Ok that was not surprising either. She gets up and gets into bed. I ask her what the sound was and she was like what sound (which is strange since she wakes to soft sounds let alone this one). I ask her a couple of other questions and get weird/no responses.

* A few seconds later, she has a massive seizure. For someone who has never seen a seizure, this is probably the scariest thing of all time. Her mouth clenched up, arms clenched up, eyes even roll up, breathing kinda stops too. It's like the person is dead and it all happens so quickly. I call 911 and the operator says put her on her side and I do and she starts breathing heavily. Still non responsive to what I'm saying but heavy breaths were a massive relief. For the next 15 minutes I think, she is still seized up, other than the heavy breathing, there was no sign she was alive. Around 1.30, she regains some proper conciousness but is very confused. 

* Goes to hospital, sodium levels are very low and she recalls that she had fallen in the bathroom and actually hit her head.

* Doctor says that the seizure was likely caused by her really low sodium levels because of the lack of food and nonstop vomiting. 

* She'll be under observation in hospital to get her sodium levels back today.

Some relevant background - she almost certainly had covid early March 2020, not tested but the symptoms were there. She was overseas and didn't go to hospital but she was literally on a spin bike several times to help her breathe. The fatigue and loss of smell taste were very very bad.

Apparently she spent a 4 hour flight across the aisle from someone who was coughing the entire flight and caught it from him.

I had the Moderna vaccine 2 days before her and had no major issues though.",1622138816.0,2021-05-27 11:06:56

Today Was My Vaccine Appointment - Sinopharm,2,nmrkel,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmrkel/today_was_my_vaccine_appointment_sinopharm/,22,"hey everyone,

Today was my turn to get the first shot of Covid19 vaccine but I skipped it. 

Here are my thoughts. 

Vaccine came out too early, which is fine thanks to the brilliant scientists but of course it is too early to say how reliable the vaccine is, bcoz scientists will need more data to make it even better & safer for everyone. 

I'm hearing a lot of people sharing their experience with the Covid19 vaccine & how they're dealing with the side effects, specially in younger generation. 

I'm 35, with a weak immune system, my overall health isn't the best bcoz of my 10 year long sedentary lifestyle, no exercise, working from couch/bed routine, no sleep/wake routine, no proper diet, I eat only once a day when I can, etc. So I don't know what will be the effect of Covid19 on a body like mine. 

But don't take me wrong, I definitely agree with the idea of getting vaccinated and I'm glad that world population is getting vaccinated at a fast pace. This is really important to get back to a normal lifestyle but I really feel scared of what might happen to me if I get vaccinated. 

Also 10 years ago, I had the worst joint pain, which lasted over a year. Most doctors couldn't even diagnose the problem & kept giving me heavy steroids to suppress pain. And now I read many people (even younger) are complaining about severe joint pain/rheumatoid arthritis problem after getting Covid19 vaccine. I've seen the worst so I don't even want to think about it right now. 

But then I'm also worried, for worst, what if I get Covid19 virus itself! So all in all, I'm really torn, worried, confused & not sure what should I do. Overall situation isn't so cool.",1622212274.0,2021-05-28 07:31:14

All and all as long no crazy symptom randomly pops up, I'd say the experience was annoying but definitely worth it especially for someone like me with health problems.

72h Post Second Pfizer - My Experience,2,nmoq15,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmoq15/72h_post_second_pfizer_my_experience/,1,"I wanted to share my experience with my second shot of the Pfizer vaccine as I was a lurker here and very anxious about negative reactions as a result of the selection bias on the subreddit—after all, who would post about a mundane vaccine experience? I will :)

I had an afternoon appointment so I made sure to eat a good breakfast and lunch and exercise before my shot. I got my shot at a hospital which helped a ton with anxiety: if I had an allergic reaction, I was 30 seconds away from the emergency room. The shot itself was uneventful, over in a second just like the first one. After my 15 min waiting period, I hung out around the neighborhood reading on a bench for another 45 min and then hopped on the train home.

That night, I felt pleasantly mellow almost as if I had taken CBD. My body felt like I had finished a good, hard workout (tired, but not in pain). I got to bed early and woke up a couple of times in the night as I was sweating a lot. This was partially a function of the weather but my temp was also up a little bit.

The next morning, I had chills and slight full body aches. Nothing crazy but I really didn’t want to leave my bed except to go to the bathroom and get food. Luckily, I was prepared with food and snacks and just spent the day hanging out in bed watching documentaries on Netflix. My symptoms peaked that evening with a temp of 100 F and moderate full body aches. I took 200mg ibuprofen and had a hot shower, both of which helped. I got to bed early and slept through the night.

The next day I was essentially back to normal. I felt a slight fatigue especially when exercising but went about my routine as normal.

That brings us to today! Again, a little bit tired but nothing absurd. My major persistent symptom? A resounding feeling of relief. I’ve spent the last year and a half being paranoid and stressing and it’s such a huge relief to have both of these shots in my body and to know that in about a week and a half I’ll be fully vaccinated.",1622201404.0,2021-05-28 04:30:04

Moderna Vaccine May 15th Side Effects,14,nmbcd7,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmbcd7/moderna_vaccine_may_15th_side_effects/,1,"I got my first Moderna vaccine on May 15th. I asked the nurse quite a few questions as I was expecting this vaccine site to have only Pfizer so was surprised I was getting Moderna. After answering my questions I felt okay with going ahead (I likely would have anyway as I want to tackle COVID and felt a responsibility to do my part and get vaccinated!) About three hours after getting the vaccine I had the following side effects.

At hour three I felt some flu-like symptoms and had a sore arm starting. By that evening I felt pretty out of it, low-grade fever mostly but, also an extremely sore arm and weird lower back pain that came and went. These symptoms lasted about three days...the second day was the worst and by the third day, everything was getting better. 

There was some very minor fatigue in the following week but, now I feel 100% back to normal. I have a very large family. No one had any side effects except for myself and my Dad and both of us experienced the same thing. He's 81 and is totally back to normal and feeling good. I will say the second day after my vaccine wasn't what I would say was fun by any means but, doable and not even anywhere near as bad as a bad flu. Having had family members who got COVID AND lifelong serious side effects from it, I feel the vaccines are totally worth avoiding the risk of COVID, especially with these variants being more dangerous now. I'm in Canada so my second shot isn't until September. I'll happily take it.",1622161816.0,2021-05-27 17:30:16
Help interpreting antibody results (immunocompromised),3,nmkxbk,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmkxbk/help_interpreting_antibody_results/,2,"I'm immunocompromised, and I'm wondering if anyone could help me interpret my [antibody test results](http://imgur.com/a/tGYdt89). This test was done exactly 14 days after my 2nd Pfizer shot. 

I think the test was developed by my hospital system, and the numbers don't seem to match what I'm seeing in other posts and in journal articles.

I know that the antibody levels associated with adequate protection haven't been officially established yet, but I'm wondering if anyone has some insight on:

- Whether I should consider the IgG of 1.936 AU to be a normal response, since it's above the ""positive"" cutoff of 0.7

- Whether the absence of IgA antibodies so soon after the vaccine is truly indicative of a weak immune response (and weak protection?) as the Interpretation suggests, or if that's only true in the context of an actual covid infection

[42F] Pfizer x2 doses done.,4,nmhgqa,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nmhgqa/42f_pfizer_x2_doses_done/,2,"Hi all, wanted to share my positive experience so far with receiving both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.

I am a 42F, AFAB. No major health history to share except for TMJ (I grind my teeth at night sometimes) and elevated TPO antibodies (thyroid, related to Hashimotos but I do not have a formal diagnosis, nor do I take meds). I am relatively healthy, slim, active, and do not take any medications at all except for vitamin supplements and very infrequently ibuprofen for headaches or pain. I am a registered nurse and a data-nerd, so I followed my symptoms closely for the sake of good documentation. I considered this a pretty good experience although I was definitely a little anxious initially.

I have now received both doses of Pfizer vaccine, the second one on 5/21.

After the first dose, the only real “side effect” I had was some noticeable fatigue that night, and a sore arm.

Maybe 10 hours after the second dose, I started to experience achiness and muscle tension in my back and neck. Overnight I do think I had a significantly elevated temperature and likely over 101-102, but I neglected to bring the thermometer to my bedside table (darnit, data fail) so I cannot say for sure. In the morning when I woke, my temp was 101.8 but trended down very quickly. I did start to notice a rather annoying tension headache brewing around 9am and took 400mg of ibuprofen; by noon my temp was 98.4 and other than a sore arm felt I was at my “baseline.” So far, no other issues have come up although if anything does I will post again in this sub.

Regarding menstruation: I'm 42, and my periods have started with some intermittent irregularity over the last year or two.  My period was supposed to show up between the two doses, but did not - and started today, which is dose 2 + 6 days.  Not heavier, not painful, no weird PMS, absolutely within a normal pattern for me except late - which recently is also not abnormal for me.  

In the weeks leading up to and between doses, I was much more diligent about taking vitamins (multi, Vit D, Vit B12) and hydrating- I am a pathetic water drinker- and did lots of stretching the day of each dose as well as a short yoga session at night. I do think being attentive to movement and especially stretching my arm seemed to help keep the achiness at bay.

I eat a primarily “paleo” type diet with an anti-inflammatory/autoimmune slant given the TPO antibodies, with a fair amount of chicken, fish, and a lot of vegan fare as well. Minimal dairy. While these details may or may not be relevant I share them here anyway in case anyone is interested in the question of nutrition and inflammation relative to vaccine response.

Overall I would call this a positive experience and I am grateful my body’s response to these vaccines was not unreasonable. I'd estimate I had about 12 hours of feeling a little rough but very manageable.  I did initially have concerns about autoimmunity and risk of worsening issues- I suppose time will tell? For now though- so far so good!",1622177914.0,2021-05-27 21:58:34

The shot when getting it hurt when I first got it but I hate shots. Sitting there for the 15 min wait I felt tingling all alone my arm I got the shot in & a slight headache. Within after the wait & 30-40 mins after I still felt the slight headache & this weird feeling in my ear on the side I got the shot as if someone had poked like a pen or something thing & long into my ear & felt cold air coming in it. After that passed I didn't feel anything for the rest of the night. Next day I definitely felt fatigue & my arm was sore like I slammed it against the wall. But later that day it lessened & by the next day I felt perfectly fine. My husband only got the tingling in the first 15 mins of getting the shot & the fatigue & arm soreness the next day as well but nothing else.

This is my first post here. So I got my first moderna shot about a month ago and my arm was very sore which I expected since I’m skinny and was fine. I woke up the next day and felt kind of out of it and foggy brained and just laid in bed all day. I also had some diarrhea but I have IBS and a gluten intolerance I ignore so that’s about an everyday occurrence lmao. It also messed up my period so I totally missed my period for that cycle. 

But all in all it wasn’t too bad. Well today I got the second dose about six hours ago and I have pretty extreme anxiety. I take medication for it but sometimes I can still stress myself out over dumb stuff. I guess it’s also worth noting that I have an extreme fear of throwing up. Well I came home from the vaccine and was absolutely RAVENOUS so I ate a burger, three slices of pizza, coke, and giant piece of cake. To be fair I had breakfast a long time ago but I was just so stupidly hungry. Well then I sit down and decide to freak myself out and look up symptoms of the 2nd moderna shot snd Im seeing all these horror stories that include nausea and vomiting. Well now I’m terrified. I’m gassy and I don’t know if it’s from the ridiculous amount of food I ate, the stress I’m causing myself, or the damn vaccine. 

All my moderna pals, what symptoms did you have after the second dose? In freaking out here y’all.

**Day 1**

* Initial needle poke 2/10 pain, barely felt.

* 15 minute, no reaction. Had sweaty hands, feet and armpits though (quite sure just my anxiety)
* Crazy thirst + elevated hunger
* No heart racing, dizziness, lightheadedness or anything visually impairing.
* Maybe 8 hours in a noticeable slight tiredness settled in. No fever, chills, body aches
* Took a 500mg Tylenol right before bed for ""defense"" lol
* Slept 12 hours later with just a sore arm and slight tiredness
* Woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat in my legs/crotch region
* Woke up half asleep somewhere a bit after the night sweat remembering my body odor smelled like individuals who eat heavy garlic/heavy spice based cuisines.
* Temp checked for 98.3F (really not sure if the Tylenol was already doing it's job but no fever)

**Day 2**

* Woke up with body aches everywhere, felt like I had done a heavy workout from the day before
* Temp check to \~97F
* Felt brain fog
* Slight chest pains and very noticeable shortness of breath--this feeling that something was inside or sitting in between my nipples
* REALLY felt tired, slept a total of 3-4 hours of extra nap time through the day on top of 7 hours sleep.
* Crazy thirst still + elevated hunger

**Day 3**

* Most shortness of breath went away, not much chest pains
* Felt overall more ""normal""
* Brain fog, crazy thirst, hunger, tiredness mostly gone

* Slept soundly

**Day 4**

* Feeling pretty damn normal 60 hours later
* Still have a slight tender arm at the site of injection (hearing it goes away in day 4 to 5) but it is definitely not as painful as days 1-3

I had my first Pfizer shot about 3 weeks ago and since then I had noticed my heart rate was quite fast, after 2 weeks I became more paranoid about my heart rate and got my partner to check it and it was 140 which I was able to get down to 120 but no lower, went to the Dr and they gave me a blood test for hyperthyroid, troponin and D-dimer. The D-dimer came back very elevated to which I was told to go to the ER. They ruled out PE and clotting and believed the D-dimer was elevated due to inflammation.

I have an auto-immune condition (ankylosing spondylitis) which is currently not being treated so I have pretty high levels of inflammation at the moment. Echo was normal and so were most of my bloods. I had no chest pain or breathing issues. The tachycardia they figure was due to the auto-immune condition and high levels of inflammation but I hadn't really noticed high heart rate/palpitations until recently. I can feel my heart beating and its quite often a thumping feeling which doctors said was due to being lean? They've put me on anti-inflammatories (celebrex) and my heart rate seems to have come down.

Given the normal echo, bloods and lack of chest pain/breathing issues, is this likely not myocarditis?

The first shot gave me a horrible migraine with a pain level of 8 to 9 so it was bad and it occurred withing 10 minutes and it put me down for the day. I wasn't really sure if I was gonna go get the second shot. I'm healthy so having dizzy spells is unlike me. I decided to wait it out and see if I could feel confident about driving again or doing other daily activities. I was scheduled foray 3rd 2021 for my second and felt ok and confident enough to do it. I figured within 2 weeks I'd have another set of dizzy spells and I did and it soon went away. I still have bouts of aloofness but I can drive again with more confidence and feel like it was still a good decision. I did not see a doctor regarding my dizzy spells but I did take naproxen sodium to assist with the brain fuzz and I did report my findings to VAERS.

I ran a fever of 101, my whole body (especially arms and legs) hurt, and my joints felt like they were being crushed. I had chills and was unable to sleep that first night. The pain was intense and it felt worse than the flu. But 24 hours after getting the second shot, I broke out into a cold sweat and then my fever disappeared. The pain was completely gone by the second day and I felt completely normal by the third day, albeit my allergies bugging me again for a week afterward. My periods were normal and on time both months and have been normal and on time since finishing shot two. I’ve returned to working in person, and I’ve been going out more an exercising a lot more since becoming fully vaccinated. 

My pre-existing health issues before getting the vaccine were tachycardia (fast heart rate), asthma, migraines, and scarred lungs from a bad infection I got when I was 25. The vaccine had no effect on my heart, lungs, or migraines. 

My stepsister was next (20F, works with children). She got the Pfizer. No issues with either dose except a sore arm and a flu-like feeling that lasted 12 hours. Periods normal. 

Then my mother (57F) got her shot a week after me. She got the Pfizer and was very scared. She also has a heart issue (a leaky valve). She felt very sick after the second dose, our symptoms were actually completely identical, but her symptoms all went away after 24 hours. She has also returned to work in person as of two months ago. 

My step-aunt (early 50s) got the Pfizer. No issues but a very sore arm. 

My aunt (60sF) got the Moderna. She had no issues but a sore arm. Has diabetes. 

My step-grandmother (84F) got the Pfizer. No issues except a sore arm. 

My grandfather (78M) got the Pfizer. No issues except a sore arm. Was actually out riding his bike and trimming the hedges the day afterward even though we told him not to. 

My step-father (60M) was the last and got the Johnson & Johnson because he’s stubborn and subscribes to some mRNA conspiracy theories, and he wanted just one shot to try to avoid the symptoms that typically come with the second shot. He has heart disease and has had triple bypass surgery and takes heart/cholesterol medication and has a history of blood clots. He felt very ill the day after his shot and took the day off from work, but his symptoms were gone by the following day. 

I won’t lie, after the second shot, I felt like I had fallen off a cliff and was beaten. It was definitely the sickest I’ve felt since I was last in the hospital with the bad infection I got five years ago. But it was short-term (12 hours only) and I would absolutely do it again. I can’t say how relieved I am to know that myself and my family members have been vaccinated. It’s like a weight has been lifted off me. I can go places without worrying about catching COVID and passing it onto one of my family members. I still wear a mask in public, but for the first time in a year, I no longer worry about it anymore. I know that a lot of people only post negative things here, and I know a lot of people are on the fence about getting vaccinated and are scared. Please just know that you don’t hear positive stories as much simply because they’re boring and uneventful, and people move on with their lives after getting vaccinated. Whether you get the vaccine or not is your choice, but I hope this post helps those of you who want to get the shot but are anxious to do so.",1622123339.0,2021-05-27 06:48:59
My (30F) neutral moderna experience,5,nm9azm,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nm9azm/my_30f_neutral_moderna_experience/,0,"I got my 1st moderna vaccine on april 23rd. the arm soreness was the worst part. late that night, I had some loose stool and was nauseous, I'm not sure it was related to the shot though. 

I was really scared that the nausea would be much worse after round 2. So I prepared by buying some dramamine and some powerades to keep me hydrated. 

I got my 2nd shot almost a week ago now, on May 21st. for some reason, the needle going in hurt a lot more than the first shot, is this typical? but my arm was less sore. I was going into the day with little sleep unfortunately, so I was very tired but I'm not sure how much of that was due to the shot. I slept A LOT through the next 24 hours or so. at night I was scared to getting nauseous again so I took some draminine. I was being careful to keep hydrated as well. I never took my temperature, but I didn't feel feverish, or get chills at any point. I did feel hot, and had to change clothes a few times because I was sweating, but you could probably put that down to the weather shifting and i'm not quite used to it yet lol

my experience was pretty neutral, I would say. not terrible. not completely uneventful either. I would do it again if need be.",1622156280.0,2021-05-27 15:58:00

The pain isn't severe, but more like a dull ache that is constantly there.   I've taken tylenol and ibuprofen with no relief.   I can feel it sometimes in my nose, and on the roof of my mouth and inside the sinus cavity.

If I close my eyes I feel like I'm floating and have a loopy feeling.

I am worried this could be something worse, but I don't want to jump the gun and see a doctor if it's just a stubborn side effect that will pass.

The doctor did not find anything in the blood tests, but I felt worse every day.

After 3 weeks the situation became even worse. I started having a fever and chest pain. Then I went to the ER where they found the troponin level over 6500 ng/l. The same day I was hospitalized and diagnosed with Myocarditis. I was released after 3 days. I am currently receiving a beta blocker, and I am home.

At this point, feel better every day, but I still haven't recovered 100%. I have not yet decided what to do about the second vaccination.

Quarantine Length in Schools,2,nm7bnl,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nm7bnl/quarantine_length_in_schools/,2,"Good morning - My daughter (13F, 4 days post first Pfizer vaccine) was sent home yesterday due to COVID exposure. We were told that you could not return to school for 7 days, however the paperwork/CDC guidelines still recommend quarantining for 10-14 days after exposure. 

I'm trying to figure out when she was likely exposed, starting yesterday masks are no longer required but I am guessing she was exposed prior to yesterday. We also don't believe that she had direct contact with someone that has tested positive (her close friends) and it's more likely a student in one of her classes. 

Does anyone know why the school would only require her to quarantine for 7 days? Is it because she was exposed 3-7 days prior to the school sending her home (which would total the 10-14 days)? Or is it different for kids or that making them quarantine for the 14 days means they would not be able to return to school this year and they wanted the kids back the last few days? 

Also, we are debating what to do with our memorial day plans - if she should not go, if she should get tested (which I understand there is the possibility of still showing negative) or if by Saturday she isn't showing symptoms, she's probably fine.

Can I ask all the vaccinated uterus-owners/menstruators who did *not* have menstrual changes after being vaccinated to share here?,4,nm2ap2,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nm2ap2/can_i_ask_all_the_vaccinated/,32,"This is my primary concern about getting vaccinated myself.

I have heard about people experiencing heavy bleeding unexpectedly or unusually painful periods, clotting, missed periods etc. 

This frightens me for many reasons - more so the heavy bleeding and/or spontaneous bleeding. It's concerning to me either way as vaccines don't tend to do this in general. And since there was no ovulators in the trials, I don't know if anyone knows or is paying attention or cares if this is a thing or not or why it is happening.

I know that it's anecdotal and menstrual changes could be happening in these people regardless of the vaccine and it could be all coincidental. I guess you only hear from the people who have the experience and not those who don't, so it's unbalanced. 

I would just love to hear from people who did not experience these things. 

Maybe if you're happy to share your age, the vaccine you received, 1st or both shots, when in your cycle you received the vaccine, and if you're on any birth control and what kind.

Moderna - Pityriasis Rosea,15,nlwi0j,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nlwi0j/moderna_pityriasis_rosea/,7,"Hey all

Received my first dose end of March, 2nd dose end of April. 5 weeks in between if that matters for your purposes. 

I'm an early 20s female, never had covid. Fully vaxxed for other viruses, the typical baby and childhood vaccines. 

2nd dose was much worse injection pain and that night I was shaking super uncontrollably due to chills, then would wake up drenched in sweat, not joking my arms and legs and ears were soaked. 

Other than the first night being bad, I experienced nausea the day after and couldn't lift my arm easily. 

I thought I made it out pretty good considering some bad stories. However, 1 week after first dose I noticed what I *thought* was ringworm. 

Went to 2 docs to get their opinions since this rash was spreading after a new diagnosis and their creams weren't working. 

First they said it's eczema, just use the steroid cream. It got worse, and even more scaly. Went back, doc says it's ringworm. I ended up using the antifungal cream perfectly and it still wouldn't go. 

Finally googled *again* and pityriasis rosea is on my radar. See a 3rd doctor because I'm convinced my primary doesn't give a flying fuck. She says it's PR! Says she could immediately tell. 

So. Nothing else in my environment changed, no new job, no new contact with people or animals. Same medications, you get it. The only thing different was getting the vaccine and the timeline of them getting worse with each dose makes sense. Thankfully this will resolve on its own and isn't contagious- just insanely itchy. 

I've seen people here talk about a temporary rash near the injection site and shingles. Unfortunately my rash has been going on for about 6 weeks. If you have a weird rash after the vaccine that persists, get it checked out so it's more well known.",1622107327.0,2021-05-27 02:22:07

Good experience with J&J (27F),8,nlp4wq,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nlp4wq/good_experience_with_jj_27f/,5,"Got my J&J dose 11 days ago. I'm generally healthy, no preconditions, no allergies, no previous covid infection.

**Day 1:** Got the vaccine at 11:20. Drank plenty of water througout the day and took preventive Fervex (similar to Coldrex, Tylenol, etc.) in my tea every 6-8 hours. Also kept the food intake to boiled potatoes and salad, since everyone seems to advise that lighther food is better. Except for the sore arm and feeling a bit tired, no other symptoms during the 1st day. (the tiredeness might have been due to the fact that I woke up at 6am to go to the vaccination center)

**Day 2:** Woke up at 6:30 with a fever of 38° and a sore arm. Tea+Fervex again and the temperature was down to 36,5° by 08:00. Two more spikes of 37° during the day, one at noon, one around 18:00. Kept drinking plenty water, Tea+Fervex every 6-8 hours, and kept a light diet again (leftover boiled potatoes and salad). Needless to say I spent both days in front of the TV.

**Day 3:** No fever at all, arm was still a little sore and I felt a bit tired. Did a market run and realized that I was having hot flashes during the trip, and the market isn't even that far from my place - but still. Also this might be due to the year-long home office and gyms being closed and not the vaccine itself.

**Days 4-11:** The arm pain faded somewhere around day 4 or 5, the tiredness as well. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels have also remained normal (home use devices to keep track of this, available on Amazon). I can do a full market run without pausing to sit down in front of the building.

I do have a check up scheduled with my GP tomorrow as I would like to have a blood work done just for my own peace of mind. Also kinda curious to see what's gonna happen with my period this month, as I've read some posts here that it might be affected. It's already off by one day.

All in all, a **really good experience** with the vaccine. Now looking forward to hitting the two week mark.  


Edit: I'm also a regular smoker, so kind of reduced smoking in the first week and also no alcohol intake.  ",1622085672.0,2021-05-26 20:21:12

Relieved to finally be vaccinated!,1,nm0dsq,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nm0dsq/relieved_to_finally_be_vaccinated/,0,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my positive experience here for anyone who needs to hear something positive about the vaccine. Seeing all of the stories out there about negative side effects can really be overwhelming and scary. 

I got my second Pfizer shot a little over two days ago and I feel frickin’ great my dudes! My first shot I had an extremely sore arm. Literally felt like someone lost control of their bowling ball when throwing it down the lane at the bowling alley and it landed smack dab on my arm. It felt really swollen and bruised for a few days and was pretty uncomfortable, but I also did not move my arm at all after getting the shot. Outside of that, I felt pretty tired for about a week and a half and had one dizzy spell, but to be completely honest I had also just started a new birth control pill so it could have been that. And I guess that’s the point… The minor side effects I experienced were so minor that I can’t be sure what exactly caused them. 

I read stories where people developed side effects like a week after the second shot, so I will update my post if anything comes up, but I honestly feel perfectly normal. I’m not even tired. And my arm was hardly sore this second time around because I moved it a lot and applied arnica/cbd salves immediately after I got the shot. 

All in all, I am so relieved to be vaccinated and not worry about catching this virus anymore. My fear of catching COVID over the last year has seriously been awful. One of my good friends got it and has had terrible long term side effects, and it’s been over a year for him now. I have suffered from severe bronchitis almost every year since I was 13 and I know it’d probably be a close call for me and my weak lungs with how this thing attacks your lungs so intensely. 

At least 10 people I am very close with have been fully vaccinated now and are in perfect health and had very minimal side effects. Please get vaccinated!!! Believe in the professionals who have dedicated their lives to this!!! You can do it.",1622122001.0,2021-05-27 06:26:41
J&j experience,9,nlln2y,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nlln2y/jj_experience/,0,"Hi everyone, I got the j&j vaccine yesterday at 12:30, and my friend got his with me. We were both feeling fine other then the slight soreness in our arms and decided to go to the gym afterwards. There was no problems with our workouts, we both forgot we even got vaccinated until my timer for 6 hours went off. I set that timer because I was reading on a different Reddit community that some people were feeling sick after 6 or so hours (we stayed at the gym for a while after we worked out to swim and chill) when the timer went of we were in the steam room, and I asked my friend if he felt sick to any degree and he said no and I also didn’t feel sick. After leaving the gym and going home, it would’ve been around 8 or 9 pm, I started to relax and unwind and then I started to feel really cold and shivery. I texted my friend and asked if it was just me and he said he too was getting cold. After an hour or so passed, I decided to go to bed and I started getting gnarlyyyyyy back aches, I couldn’t for the life of me get comfortable and through out the night I was tossing and turning trying to adjust myself such that my back wouldn’t hurt. After the worst sleep of my life, I woke up at 4:30 am and realized the pain went down a little bit but I still felt really sick. My friend woke up at the same time and texted saying he felt the same and had the worst night of sleep he’s had in a while, I’ve felt the same way up until the point of writing this(11:45 am) and we’re about 24 hours deep.

If possible I’d say to get the vaccine at night after a full day of eating healthy so that way you can go to sleep no problem and possibly fight off the side effects while you sleep. If you lift/workout you shouldn’t have any performance issues at the gym immediately after getting the shot, but if you feel achey like me then you might have to prepare to skip a day or 2 depending on how well you fight it off. Anyway, thanks for the advice everyone I hope my experience can help you if you’re worried about getting vaccinated. You’ll be okay just clear out a day just in case you feel sickly and prepare for flu like symptoms.",1622076638.0,2021-05-26 17:50:38

This morning, I had a very extreme symptom of chills. My body was shivering so bad for 2 hours straight and I was soo cold, even though I had covers all over me and two dogs 😂. I went to take a hot shower and almost pass out. I had to get my boyfriend up (this was at like 6am) to take care of me because I felt like I was gonna die. It is now 11am, and, after some rest, I feel much better. 
I hope this story doesn’t discourage anyway from getting the vaccine; the effects can be very different on each person, as displayed in the fact my boyfriend has not felt sick at all.

If only one out of a thousand resulted in Myocarditis, that would be 288000 cases of it. Yet hospitals are... surprisingly quiet nowadays. You don't hear of cardiologists being swamped with heart inflammation cases. The cardiology wing of my local hospital doesn't seem much more active than normal. We don't see lines of people clutching their chest in the ER waiting rooms. 

You're gonna see a lot of posts from people here who have only had their profile active for a month suddenly posting again and again of their post-vaccine health woes. Or profiles that were active for a few days years ago suddenly come roaring back to life. 

Examples!

https://old.reddit.com/user/wooden_cranberry_2
https://old.reddit.com/user/Embarrassed-Ad-8285
https://old.reddit.com/user/Lockdown0084

When you're doomscrolling and see a report that seems very dramatic, look at the user profile and see if they also tend to report on /r/conspiracy or /r/nonewnormal. Or if the account *just exists* to talk about their newly acquired post-vac medical conditions. 

And again, look at the statistics. 288 million people have got their shots. How come the hospitals and health centers are all quiet? 

Maybe the science is right and the vaccines are pretty safe?

Just here to share my story because I’ve seen so many people saying how nervous they were about side effects, and so was i! 

Yesterday my bf and I decided to go get vaccines, we booked our appointments online and H‑E‑B (Texas) had open slots same day.

My appointment was at 5:00p and his was at 5:30p. We were a few mins late but the entire process took no more than 10 mins for us both to get vaccinated and leave. (They didn’t make us wait 15 mins, we just got the shot and walked out) 

The shot itself, (the needle) I could barely even feel, but the act of the vaccine entering my arm felt a little weird. Both of our arms were tingling as we were leaving the store. 

That weird feeling went away after about ten mins or so. 

After leaving H‑E‑B we grabbed Wendy’s on our way home for a snack / early dinner because we hadn’t eaten since noon. 

We got home, both took a BC powder and drank tons of water. We chilled for a few hours, watched a movie and just laid around the house. 

No side effects other than a tiny tiny tiny bit of soreness in our arms. 

We went to bed around 11:30p, and slept until about 8a. My bf has no side effects and arm soreness is pretty much gone. 

My arm is a little more sore today than it was last night. But no fever, no chills, no headache or anything. & i was really worried about it! 


Writing this to say; even if your anxious about it, YOU CAN DO IT & its not as bad as the horror stories sound. (But Everyone reacts differently)

I was extremely anxious about getting the vaccine but decided to do it, and I wanted to share a positive experience if it can ease someone’s worries.

First dose 4/30 - no side effects except a very sore arm at the injection site (most sore that I’ve been for a vaccine but was manageable). Lasted about 5 days.

Second dose 5/21 - Sore arm within a couple hours again, like the first time. Other side effects started about 10 hours after the shot (middle of the night) with a very low grade fever (100F) / chills / general tossing and turning. Woke up with a dull headache and just feeling fatigued and some mild body aches as well. Took ibuprofen throughout that day, took a couple naps, and about 48 hours after the shot I was back to normal. 

I noticed no impacts to my allergies, eczema, or period as a result of the shot. To prepare I had no alcohol the 3-4 days before and after both doses and also hydrated as much as I could with water. The day of and after I also drank a lot of coconut water and Gatorade, which seemed to help. I also take daily vitamin D to begin with, so that might have had a positive impact on my side effects.

To begin, I want to disclaim that everyone has different experiences and not to assume my experience will be what you should expect.

I am 30 yrs old Male, east asian/european with a slim build. I have an anxiety/panic disorder and kind of a hypochondriac. So you can guess that this experience was rough for me even before I got the 2nd shot. I have logged most of what I could through the day and night and wanted to share with you all my experience.

Lastly, I definitely recommend getting BOTH shots. Going through this experience was not easy, but knowing I am protecting myself and people around me makes me feel extremely proud to have taken the plunge.

My first shot experience is below the 2nd.

**Moderna 2nd dose** 5/25/2021

11:00am - 2nd shot administered

12:15pm - Took 500 mg Tylenol in anticipation, no symptoms yet.

1:20p - Head felt a bit of pressure, slightly foggy. Kind of like I was coming down with something.

3:30p - Felt groggy/tired. Just didn't really want to get up from the couch. Took another 500 mg Tylenol.

3:45p - Tremors kicked in (anxiety related). Had a bunch of negative thoughts regarding the side effects.

7:45p - Body started to feel a teeny bit warmer, figured this was the beginning. (98.9F)

9:15p - Body aches in arms, legs and back. Had chills but probably anxiety related again. Definitely really tired and hard to move. (99.3F) Took 350mg Tylenol. (worried that I was taking too much on an empty stomach.

11:26p - Could not lay down, felt a bit lightheaded. Body was really achy and tired. Skin was feeling sensitive to the touch. (99.4F)

11:43p - Took 350mg Tylenol. Heart rate just shot up to like 120bpm for a good minute of so but subsided quickly after I did 10 mins of meditation.

\*note I usually go to bed around 9:30p, so I feel like staying up made my experience a bit worse cause I was fighting being tired from the vaccine and not sleeping on time\*

11:57p - Lower back pain, extremely achy around my entire body. I felt hot but wasn't sweating or cooling down, so I got a towel and dipped it in ice water and put it on my neck to help me cool down. (99.7F)

5/26/2021

12:04a - Body felt really hot and I was worried it was going to get much worse so I got an ice pack to help me cool down. Body still very achy and had tension headaches. (100.0F)

12:23a - Body still hot, body aches and fatigue. Back pain. super lethargic and fatigue. Felt a little sick to my stomach because I was really hungry but couldn't eat anything. Sipped on ginger ale and water with a little bit of salt. I realized that I didn't have enough sodium when I realized my mouth was dry even though I was drinking a lot of water. (\~64 oz throughout the day) (100.3F)

1:15a - Took 150mg Tylenol (kept having my doses but increased frequency)

1:37a - Fatigue, body ache, headache. Body felt a bit for relaxed. (99.7F)

Fell asleep THANKFULLY

3:55a - Woke up with slight body aches and fatigue. (98.7F)

Slept

5:22a - Woke up with slight body aches and fatigue. (98.5F) 

7:04a - Writing this post (98.7F) Tired and achy.

&#x200B;

Edit:

9:00a - slight fever started kicking in (99.5F) body still in very achy and tired. Body heaviness now.

9:15a - took a cool shower WHICH HELPED A LOT! Got into bed, put on some meditation music, took a Xanax and a 325mg Tylenol and fell asleep

1:15p - woke up (4 hours of sleep felt so amazing), body feels tired but soreness has largely subsided. Still a little heavy and now I feel like my nose is a bit congested. No headaches and can largely walk around without feeling like Gumby.

2:00p - drank a bit of a smoothie and had some chicken noodle soup. Almost 5 mins later, my body kicked into overdrive and I got a fever of about 99.7F and aches got bad again. This happened about 3 time throughout the day. Took some Tylenol 325mg and felt better

7:00p - body aches subsided, I feel really good now. Did take another Tylenol 325 mg for good measure. No headache. No fatigue. Almost feels like I’m back to normal. 

8:30p - sore arm at injection site, that’s it!! I think I’m almost out of the woods. But I heard it may come back in another wave but I’ll keep you guys posted. (97.9F)

5/27/2021

9:30a - body aches are gone. Fever is gone. Though I feel some small lump in my right armpit along with minor fatigue and brain fog. I’m able to eat and drink no problem. 

**Moderna 1st dose** 4/26/2021

12:15pm - 1st shot administered.

12:25pm - slight sore shoulder, like a mini bruise.

12:45pm - slight discomfort in elbow.

3:15pm - Super sore arm, almost like I got punched in the arm really hard.

4:15pm - Slightly tired, feeling a tiny bit ""off"", kind of like I wanted to take a nap. But this might have been psychosomatic.

5:30pm - VERY slightly achy, and didn't eat much dinner. Arm was still really sore.

4/27/2021

9:00am - SUPER sore arm, could not lift it up.

no other symptoms.

This is perhaps the biggest difference with mRNA vaccines, since AstraZeneca is detected immediately by the immune system and triggers a response pretty early. I'd say these side effects are justified if I consider that already in 5 days I'll have the first antibodies (it would take 3 weeks with a mRNA jab).

First dose was on 04/24: I went to my local drive thru vaccination clinic. It was super well organized, and quick. I have a minor allergy to shellfish which I alerted them to, but they weren't worried as it has never caused anaphylactic shock for me. They just had me wait an extra 5 minutes. I immediately got a sore throat but  had no trouble breathing so they let me on my way. For the following week I was tired, dizzy, and the sore throat persisted. I then had trouble breathing with the sore throat for about a week, but it never got too concerning. In the third week my sore throat finally went away, but I started having numb fingers, toes, and face, trouble thinking, dizziness, muscle spasms, elevated heart rate, and trouble breathing. I went to urgent care. Urgent care told me it was anxiety, and I went to my psychiatrist for further instruction. She agreed it was anxiety and gave me a stronger anti-anxiety medication. Most of the symptoms went away after that. I think maybe some minor chest discomfort was making me have panic attacks that I was having horrible vaccine side effects (probably from reading too many posts on places like this, lol).

Second dose was on 05/22: Same drive thru. Still super quick and easy. Same immediate allergic reactions. I just took an anti-histamine and some tylenol this time and it wasn't so bad. Other than some minor soreness at the injection site I was 100% after the allergic reaction settled down maybe 3 hours later. I've had zero other side effects, and I'm ready to enjoy the summer safely.",1622016684.0,2021-05-26 01:11:24

I posted here a few days ago in response to a number of women who’ve been experiencing hormonal issues since they’ve been vaccinated (irregular periods, etc.) 

Like I mentioned in the other post, I’m a woman in my 40s, still getting regular (or mostly regular) periods, not on any HRT or hormonal birth control, and the shots didn’t seem to change anything with my menstrual cycle. 

That said, I’ve noticed that since I got the shots, I’ve maybe had a slight uptick in hypoglycemic “episodes.” I’m a normal weight, not diabetic/pre-diabetic (get regular bloodwork). I’m not formally diagnosed as hypoglycemic. Pre-vaccination, very occasionally if I waited too long to eat I’d get a little shaky. POST vaccination I’ve noticed that it seems to be happening more often and with more severity-from shaking only I could notice (pre vax) to shaking other people can notice (post vax). 

Is this necessarily related to having gotten the vaccine? No idea. Maybe, maybe not. It could be age-related. It could be some other weird variable. But I saw someone mention a similar thing happening to them elsewhere on Reddit and figured I’d post it here. 

Incidentally, my reaction(s) to the vaccine otherwise were mild (tiredness for about 4 days total; the first two were significant enough that I needed extra test and couldn’t do normal stuff). If you’re reading this, hope you’re feeling ok too! 🤞",1622033362.0,2021-05-26 05:49:22

It feels almost like I got stung or something when I take a step.. it doesn’t hurt when I touch it, or when I extend it mid-air. But when I walk with pressure, each step makes my back of knee feel like I’m aggravating and stretching skin with a sting or a spider bite.

After my first pfizer shot on 4/24, the only initial issue I had was a sore arm. The next morning, I had an SVT attack that resolved on its own, but my baseline HR remained high for several days. I am usually at 60-70 resting and it was close to 80-90. Doing little things like brushing my teeth would push it to 130. 

I had insomnia and a worse SVT attack the following week. I went to the ER just to get checked out and everything came back normal. My HR has since gone back to normal though still slightly higher than usual at rest (by about 5 BPM so minimal). The weird issue I noticed is that my HR is higher now during exercise - walking, running, lifting, yoga...its all a little higher than average and seems like it takes longer to come down. My cardiologist and doctor said this is probably due to the immune response but don't have any concerns with the second shot. 

I have my second shot tomorrow and am anxious about it. I  am hoping my reaction is better to the second dose. Anyone else experience this? If so, how long did it last?",1622002676.0,2021-05-25 21:17:56

Due to this I’m only being offered the Pfizer one. I’m not anti-vax at all but am worried because the Pfizer is mRNA which scares me as it’s new and the long term effects are completely unknown.. I’m also worried because of Pfizer's terrible history, their company has been involved in many shady lawsuits- many of which about ethical issues!

Vaccine shot affecting the menstrual cycle?,25,nkrsqs,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nkrsqs/vaccine_shot_affecting_the_menstrual_cycle/,77,"I got my first shot (Pfizer) on the 20th, 5 days ago. I didn't really have any side effects besides being tired and most of my muscles aching badly on day 1. It took 5 days for the pain to go away. The only other thing I experienced was related to my period.

Right on day 2 I started seeing small amounts of old blood on my panty liners, and on day 3 I started spotting / having a very early, very light period. Now, I'm on the pill. I was taking it when it started (end of the pack), and I didn't stop taking it thinking it's just spotting. I'm honeslty not sure if I'm having a period (more than a week) early or if it's just more spotting, it's so light. I read about women who had changes in their cycle after their shot, and amongst them was a woman also on birth control who got her period in the middle of a pack. So I guess that can happen? It wouldn't be so surprising, I'm pretty sure the flu vaccine can affect cycles as well.

Besides, the pill I take is a weaker version with less hormones, and I suspect it might not be strong enough for me. If the vaccine really can affect the cycle, I wouldn't be surprised if it could overpower my pill. (Also important: I'm terrified of needles, hospitals, shots and side effects, so the amount of stress I was under could easily play into this.)

I'm not really worried about it to be honest, it's painless, light and hasn't been happening for a long time, but I'll definitely mention this to the doctor before my second shot. I'll also talk to my gynecologist as soon as I can visit him. Right now I'm just looking for people who might have had similar experiences.

&#x200B;

Edit: Oh God, I did not expect to start such an argument, haha. Seems like this is a lot more common than I thought, originally I didn't find much in google about this, that's why I posted here. I apologise if similar posts were made before, I did not find them. Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply. I too read that there isn't much known about the vaccine's effects on periods because this wasn't researched... And may I just say, I find it very ironic that despite knowing how important the female reproductive system is to us (both as people and as a species), we still don't take it seriously enough. Let's hope that this case will serve as a lesson and women's health will be taken seriously from now on. I still think that getting the shot is worth it, please don't misunderstand, numerous lives depend on it. But it is true that the lack of research and awareness on women's health is mortifying to say the least. (Imagine if muscle aches weren't known side effects, how scary would it be for people who suddenly start hurting badly after the shot?) Let's hope for the best. Stay safe everyone, take care, and again, thank you for your time :)",1621983688.0,2021-05-25 16:01:28

When my disorder was found, my other factors were elevated as well, but I haven’t been tested on them since then, besides the VIII a couple of years ago. Im uncertain to vaccinate with Moderna or Pfizer. As more and more data is coming out, I’ve seen a study (if I remember correctly) that stated .08% of vaccinated adults with mRNA vaccines had strokes or blood clots. Even though that’s an extremely low percentage it’s scary to even take that risk when I’m already disabled. I’ve also seen another article that had a hematologist hypothesizing that it was Factor IV that was causing all this. 

I haven’t known anyone else with an elevated factor VIII, and it’s hard to find data/resources with it that also concern the vaccines. Or anyone that’s had a stroke before receiving a vaccine.

Edit: I’d also like to add I’ve talked with my hematologist, there is quite a language barrier. He’s from another country with a heavy accent so it’s hard to understand him, younger than me and doesn’t seem too concerned with my FVIII clotting disorder, as he’s told me “we don’t test for that anymore” years ago when I first met him. 

I’m taking all the safety precautions that I can to stay safe from Covid, but if I could be vaccinated and not have to worry about what it would do to my body. Anyone that’s had a stroke or elevated FVIII that’s been vaccinated, it would be great to hear from.",1621988303.0,2021-05-25 17:18:23

2nd shot actually kind of hurt in the process I bled after the shot and needed a bandaid this time. The arm pain was there but it wasn’t as severe like first time.

I wanted to test it out so I did exactly what she did in the video. I washed my arm with dish soap dried it off and then stuck Bobby pins, pins, other metals and even my own magnets. Nothing stuck to my arm at all of course. So immediately I wrote it off as BS but now my arm is mildly hurting again?

There I saw a one young guy sitting with his head down on knees. I remember I saw him earlier in the queue before getting his shot he was fine. After 5 minute sitting in the area this guy starts vomiting... everyone in the hall got scared and looked at each other what’s going on. Nurses gathered around him he was sweating a lot. He vomits again. They bring a wheelchair and took him somewhere may hospital or ER room. 

Later I asked the nurses there that what happened to him is it related to vaccine. She told me that after Pfizer vaccine shot it’s normal to have some “metallic” taste in your mouth and some people can’t stand this and this can cause nausea and maybe they will vomit. Sweating was because of vomiting too and nausea itself is one of least common side effects.

- face numbness
- muscle spasms
- body aches
- face tingle?
- pressure at the top of my head

So far I've been dealing with nausea, stomach pain, random bursts of sharp pains near my hip bones (particularly my right hip bone), slight chest pain that feels similar to pleurisy, diaherra, occasional headaches, body aches, and feeling like my heart is racing or blood is racing. At first, it was only a slight fever and extreme tiredness, now it's progressed to all of the symptoms I've listed above. Any family members who received it the same day as me or before are fine so far, making me even more concerned because of how I'm feeling.  Anyone else gone through these symptoms or anything similar?

Update: talked to a nurse practitioner from the nurse hotline offered by my insurance and she recommended that I go to the er. At the er, they ran all kinds of tests and came to the conclusion I was having a very strong immune response to the vaccine and may have had covid in the past (which I strongly believe I did around when covid was first becoming a concern). They gave me anti-inflammatory meds and nausea meds and I will be seeing my doctor some time in June.

So first of all this time I'm feeling much better :) a few minutes after receiving it I already felt pain in my arm and a few hours afterwards I began feeling very tired which is unusual for me at this time. (after my first shot the symptoms started 12-15 hours afterwards)

My favorite vaccine story from history,17,nkdfik,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nkdfik/my_favorite_vaccine_story_from_history/,10,"I think it can be somewhat of a relief for people nervous about the vaccine to hear old vaccine stories and see how far we've come. One of my favorite ones is this:

Back in the American Revolution (1770s), armies on both sides would stop fighting during the winter because the cold and ice made logistics and movement extremely difficult. This meant that you had these armies of like 10,000+ soldiers holed up in cramped quarters trying to stay warm for months at a time. Nutrition was crap, which led to compromised immune systems. They would eat things called ""firecakes,"" which were just flour poured out on a rock in the middle of the fire if they didn't have a pan. Few vegetables or fruit or meat to be had. 

Naturally this caused a ton of disease to spread. Particularly smallpox. It would go through the ranks and just leave the entire army ravaged. Those who survived were weak and had a harder time fighting. 

A solution was desperately needed. What the primitive doctors of the time came up with was a smallpox vaccine. But there were no syringes or medical trials to be had. So they worked with what was available. 

*Gross details warning*


They would take the pus from an infected victim, make cuts in the arms of an uninfected person, and smear the pus into the cuts. Extremely gross, but it was effective. Smallpox cases plummeted and arguable the army was saved. If you think about it, it's basically the same principle as what vaccines for Covid do. Pus meant it was mostly a dead virus being introduced into the body as a means of inoculation. 

I just wanted to share this story because I have told it to people who are squeamish about the shot and it has given them a bit of relief knowing that what we've got today is quite advanced.",1621933855.0,2021-05-25 02:10:55

It’s small ish but it’s evidently there and it is a bit painful. Based from what I read, it is possible that it is a swollen lymph node. For anyone who has experienced the same after their first dose, how long was it until they went away? Did they go away in time for your second dose? If they did not, did you get the second dose and did it make it worse? I am reading articles saying that they should last around a week, and that I should seek medical help if they last any longer than that.

Healthy young guy here, no prior COVID that I know of. About 3 weeks after my shot, I started having bizarre issues with my legs — tingles and joint pain like I’d just run a marathon, body and nerves felt pain much more intensely. 

These symptoms persisted for a month, freaked me out (“omg am I going to feel like this forever??”) but as I focused on reducing body inflammation upon my doctor’s recommendation, they slowly subsided. 

I’m completely back to normal right now, going to the gym and playing sports and all that. 

Just wanted to offer this hope for anyone with lingering symptoms! 

Had people ask if I regret getting the shot. No, because my girlfriend is immune compromised (no side effects for her) and we were recently exposed to COVID and neither of us got it. Who knows if the virus would have been better or worse, but I can’t change the past and we’re both fine now so I’m grateful.

The peace of mind has been awesome. We love seeing our families and friends again. 

Anyway, if you resonate with any of those inflammation symptoms, I highly recommend checking out some of the simple anti inflammatory supplements people take for joint pain and arthritis (beyond just Advil). Lots of solid pubmed studies showing their effectiveness at reducing full body inflammation. 

Check with your doctor first but most of these are OTC and very gentle on the body (much more so than ibuprofen). For me, it just felt like they calmed everything down back to normal. I didn’t really notice them working, I just woke up each day noticing less and less discomfort until one day I completely forgot about it and went for a run with zero issues.

I've slept 10 hours every night and it seems like even small amounts of activity, like going for a long walk, leaves me out of breath and fatigued for the rest of the day. As someone who is super active, this is strange to me. I don't have a fever, although I feel overheated. It definitely feels quite a bit like I'm sick but without any other symptoms. 

I was not officially diagnosed with COVID-19, but in September 2019 I became extremely ill for a month (first presented as metallic taste change, cough, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, severe night sweats, sustained fever) and this quickly developed into pneumonia and was hospitalized twice. Eventually I was treated with azithromycin and improved. The doctors were not able to give me a diagnosis but sent me to an infectious disease and tropical medicine clinic, which is where I first heard the word ""coronavirus"" out loud. Of course, covid-19 wasn't a thing yet. All this to say, it's possible I had some kind of similar illness. 

I have heard that people who have had covid have a worse first dose reaction. As someone with health anxiety, the internet has caused me some concern. I've read some comments that stated the second dose helped their dizziness and fatigue. Others said it made it worse. Some still feel these side effects months later.

Pfizer - 95%
Moderna - 94%

**Side effects:**

Both appear to be practically the same too with negligible side effects. Although for both the HSE website mentions ""More than 1 in 10,000 people may develop Bell’s palsy""

BP is usually temporary as far as I know


**Other:**

Both have a 4 week gap for the second shot

With Pfizer you're good to go a week after this and Moderna is two weeks after

Happy days

**Indian variant:**

Quote:

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines appear to protect against COVID variants B.1.617 and B.1.618 first identified in India, researchers have reported in a new pre-print paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, CNN reported


More good news there

**Miscellaneous:**

Quote:

""New evidence from Israel shows the risk of severe COVID-19 was reduced by 92%, 7 days after 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine""

It's looking like almost all (if not all) 40-49 year olds in Ireland will get one of these two vaccines so I thought it'd be good to jump into the data

**TLDR:** On reading the information I've found, they seem to be pretty much the same Vaccine

I felt a little tired after the first one, but I was generally fine, and after the second one, I was quite tired and a bit brain fogged for the first 24 hours, but otherwise okay.

Five days after my first shot, I got the dreaded ""covid arm"" rash, which took over my left arm for about a week, although I would occasionally feel flare ups up until about two weeks later. During this time, my arm felt weak and painful. It's generally much better now, but it's still hurting at times. It feels something like carpal tunnel plus really needing a shoulder and upper back massage. Furthermore, I sometimes have similar feelings elsewhere in my arms or legs, although I have had these symptoms before thr shots as well. (I got the second shot in my right arm, had a small rash for 24 hours, and it was about a third the size of the first one.)

First I’ll preface this by saying I did not want to get the shot. I only did because it was required for school. 

In the hours leading up to it, I drank around 70oz of water, and drank 2 bottles of Gatorade immediately after. 

Got the shot at 5pm on a Friday. Within 10 minutes I was lightheaded and a little nauseous, but the pharmacist gave me an ice pack and it immediately went away. 

No symptoms for the next 24 hours. Saturday around 8pm, started to feel the normal symptoms. Body aches, fever, and chills. But it really wasn’t anything severe. I was expecting much worse. The only weird side effect that I had was leg pain. Saturday night and all day Sunday, my legs felt like I had ran a marathon and ibuprofen was not touching the pain. The only thing that helped was a hot bath with epsom salt. It continued for a few days, but is completely gone now. 

The last thing I’ll note is that I had no arm pain at all until three days later. I got my shot on Friday as I mentioned, and on Monday my arm hurt so much I could barely move it.  But it only lasted a day. 

Overall, even though I didn’t want to get it, I’m glad I did. It wasn’t that bad and I feel so much safer going out in public!!! Shoutout to this sub for being a place to ask questions and find people with similar symptoms. It really eased my anxiety a lot.",1621902686.0,2021-05-24 17:31:26

EDIT: I’m at the hospital now.  I will update this again with my diagnosis in case anybody else gets similar symptoms from this vaccine!

I'm not trying to spread misinformation or prevent people from getting it, I'm just offering my own experience in contrast with the standard ""sore arm and slight fever"" so many people report as standard.*

I am a 24 healthy average weight male with no immune disorders or sickness. I suppose I have fast metabolism, my GF has lower metabolism for what it's worth. (I see people saying how metabolism affects vaccine response so there you go)

Me and my GF were presumed to have Covid all the way back in February of 2020. It was so early on in the pandemic back then that we never got tested so we'll never know. I had flu symptoms, she had slightly less severe symptoms but told me later she lost part of her taste. The fact that we already had it might explain what happened. 

We had our first shot weeks ago and experienced what was basically cold symptoms + soreness for a day. We heard about how the second shot was supposed to be ""mildly worse"" than the first shot, but considering none of us had a really bad reaction we weren't worried at all.

We went into our second shot pretty cocky and took it at 4PM. We got the body soreness over the next couple of hours, but I retained energy while my GF reported severe fatigue. We went to bed at around 11PM.

**1:00 AM (9 hours post shot)**

My sleep is consumed by fitful fever dreams, sleep quality is so poor that I can't even call it ""dreams"". It was more like the urge to move around and shift my body was pushing into my mind. I had fragments of dreams, vague ideas like ""... on a mission somewhere and the objective is to shift onto your back and that's how you win"".

**2:25 AM** 

I wake up suddenly, initially feeling a bit hot, but fine. I feel the urge to urinate so I toss the covers off and walk into the bathroom. As I sit down on the cool toilet rim, I feel shivers and chills starting.

After relieving myself I make my way back to bed but I am overtaken by severe chills and fever. Nausea  starts peaking at this time too, as I feel last night's food in my throat. All of a sudden, within 30 seconds, the chills, shakes and nausea spike to 100. My GF reaches out and touches my back, I run to the bathroom heaving.

I lie down on the floor and wrap myself in blankets to abate the chills. I keep swallowing to fight back the urge to throw up (I really don't like throwing up, and I also didn't want to lose the food). The chills are spiking and abating, all I can do is lie in place and let the waves of nausea and shaking hit me.

**3:00 AM**

I am lying on the floor of the bathroom wrapped in blankets, still shivering uncontrollably. With the waves of nausea hitting so hard, there are times where I am convinced I'm about to vomit, only to fight it back at the last minute. Sleep is impossible, all I can do is breath heavily, shift my body in the blankets and keep swallowing to fight back the nausea. I try watching a video on my phone, but it hovers between distracting and causing nausea via the bright screen.

The soreness and arm pain people generally complain of is bad, but not extreme, yet it's almost impossible to lie still. The urge to move around is overwhelming, moving my limbs provides a second of relief and then it's back to the burning, stiff pain.

**4:30 AM**

The waves of nausea slightly abate, replaced by a deep, throbbing pain throughout my entire body. My head is aching now, my skin feels like it's burning and I can feel the throbbing of my heart in my ears and head. I move from the bathroom floor back to the bedroom floor (the bed feels too stuffy and hot), and curl up in blankets at the foot of the bed. My GF is completely knocked out, not experiencing fever but so tired she won't wake.

If I wrap myself in blankets the chills and the pain of cold air on my body subside, but the nausea slowly creeps back. If I toss the blankets off, the nausea subsides, but the pain of cold air against my burning skin hurts too much as well as the immediate shakes and chills.

By now I am very tired but I still can't sleep. I'm too tired to keep my eyes open or look at my phone, but too nauseous and feverish to close them. Only shifting around and focusing on breathing noisily and heavily is helping me pass the minutes.

**5:20 AM (13 hours post shot)**

I feel my skin and forehead radiating so much heat that I muster the energy to crawl out of bed and grab the thermometer we keep on the shelf. I check my temperature and see a \~103 F, so I crawl back into the covers and take the thermometer with me, checking my temperature every 10 or 15 minutes.

**5:40 AM**

My temperature reaches [104.0 F](https://i.imgur.com/1TMGy8W.jpg). I start taking pictures of the thermometer because I feel like my GF won't believe me when I tell her the next morning. I don't think I've ever had a 104.0 F before, the highest I got previously was during  a really bad flu where I must have reached a high 103 F. I can certainly feel it now, too, my skin feels like the sidewalk in southern California on a hot summer's day, and the throbbing in my ears and head is only getting louder.

**6:25 AM**

Temperature reaches [104.7 F](https://i.imgur.com/26Y4SCM.jpg). The chills start to abate, now the only thing my body can feel is heat. If I shift my head or limbs, I get an instant of relief (like when you stretch your leg after having it sit in one place), and my whole body starts shaking. At this point, I'm just waiting to survive the rest of the night and hope that daytime brings down my fever.

**7:00 AM**

Temperature spikes to [106.5 F](https://i.imgur.com/rnqXxPZ.jpg). At this point my chills are completely gone, replaced by a feeling of extreme warmth. I almost feel like I could sleep, until sudden waves of nausea and uncontrollable shakes hit. My headache leads into some kind of vertigo: every time I move, I feel the sensation one does right before he falls asleep, the sensation of falling or swimming. 

Instead of allowing myself to fall into a fitful sleep again, I go onto Discord and share my temperature readings in chat. Some people chime in to say my temperature is dangerous and I should go to see a doctor. Of course, everything except the ER is closed, so I decide to wait a while. 

Through the window, the very first hints of light are seeping into the room, giving me hope and helping me forward through the fever.

**7:30 AM**

At the encouragement of people in Discord, I decide to call the ER to figure out if I need to go in with my temperature, that has dropped to a steady \~105 F with occasional spikes. They transfer me to a nurse line and the on-call nurse encourages me to take ibuprofen. I have 800MG pills of pure ibuprofen in the drawer left over from a previous prescription, and I take one. Moving around is extremely difficult, I can feel the desire to lose consciousness is growing. However, light is filtering through the window and I can tell morning is almost here.

**8:00 AM (16 hours post shot)**

The sun is about to break through the night. My fever is still peaking, and I'm staring at the ceiling waiting for the ibuprofen to kick in. Shifting my limbs and focusing on my breathing to pass the final minutes.

**8:15 AM**

Daybreak. My fever immediately starts receding. I crawl into bed next to my GF. All my symptoms, apart from the splitting headache and soreness, start receding. The blissful light from behind the grey cloud almost moves me to tears. Temperature reads around \~102 F.

I fall into a fitful sleep for about 30 minutes, but further sleep is impossible. I end up watching videos on my phone, with a \~100 F temperature. The lower fever feels so much better, but my body still feels wreaked by the vaccine, like a temporary  relief instead of the end of the struggle.

**20 hours post shot**

My GF ends up waking up at noon with no symptoms yet and we snuggle in bed for a bit. At 1:00 PM she starts complaining of a fever. My fever returns to \~101 F, and we both try sleeping to no avail. 

We end up sitting on the couch downstairs as the hours tick by, to worsening fever. I haven't really slept in about 15 hours, and I start getting some mild auditory and olfactory hallucinations. My GF makes some food but we end up only picking at it and tossing the rest away. I eat a single chicken wing and feel instantly nauseous.

**28 hours post shot**

My GF starts getting hit by more severe fever around 8:00 PM. It kicks in hard, just like it did for me, and by 9:00 PM she's retching loudly, on the edge of throwing up. I take her temperature and see she is now at a \~103 F.  I massage her head in bed for a while and she takes an ibuprofen. She's miserable and can only sit in place fighting back nausea. Everything's lining up for it to be another long, hard night.

Suddenly, at around 11:00 PM, my GF proclaims she feels better and hungry. Her fever breaks and she decides to go downstairs to eat. I sit at my computer for 30 minutes and realize I feel much better, too, good enough to sleep.

I crawl into bed and instantly knock out, waking up at times throughout the night to a COMPLETELY soaked bed. By the time I wake up next morning at 11 AM, my GF and I have no more fever and feel almost completely back to normal.

**48 hours post shot**

Both of us feel weary and tired, but the overwhelming majority of our symptoms have mercifully abated. These coming 24 hours will involve cleaning sheets, doing laundry, and cleaning up the sick mess from the past days.

**Conclusion:** I would definitely do it again if I had to, albeit much more mentally prepared. We are kind of baffled that no one around us warned us that we could have these extreme and severe effects. What's strange is that both of us got the same extreme and unusual effects, not just one. Perhaps that batch of vaccine in particular was affected? Perhaps it's just because both of us caught Covid way back in February of 2020? I thought that was long enough for any learned immunity to wear off? Who knows....

My GF, on the other hand, says she would NOT do it again if she had to, as the experience was too much for her.

If you are going into the second shot of a MRNA vaccine, good luck! DO NOT get cocky, prepare some ibuprofen, don't eat right before going to bed, and be mentally prepared to spend a couple hours in hell. This has NOTHING to do with the first shot, so don't think that you ""know what to expect"".",1621829680.0,2021-05-23 21:14:40

I had 2nd dose of AZ vaccine on 14th April. 10 days later, I experienced blurred vision to the point I couldn’t read anything/ watch TV and was saying I needed to get my eyes checked. This continued to worsen and on Day 11 my left pupil suddenly became fully dilated. It was stuck like that for 2 days and slowly returned to normal over the following week. 

I have been left with brightness in left eye, ongoing head pain on left side of head (like the start of a migraine), eye pain that intensifies if I need to focus on anything, bouts of dizziness, neck pain and brain fog. I have also started to experienced feelings of extreme fatigue and weakness in legs and arms

CAT and MRI scans clear, blood tests clear... no sign of tumour, blood clots, stroke or MS.  I have been passed around from A&E to the Eye Hospital, Stroke Clinic and back to neuro-ophthalmology. I’ve been told that they think it’s an ocular migraine that has lasted an unusually long time - I don’t think it is.  I feel like it could be an inflammatory response to the vaccine. 

I am now Day 30 post symptoms first starting and do not seem to be improving. Interestingly my cousin who lives in the States, also experienced eye dilation 2 weeks post the Moderna vaccine  - it seems to be a very strange coincidence. 

So I am really interested to know if anyone else has experienced or noticed pupil dilation following the vaccine?

My Pfizer experience,9,njvi95,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/njvi95/my_pfizer_experience/,1,"Hi Guys, had my first dose of Pfizer on 1st of May and 2nd dose on 22nd of May.

A little background: 26 M, East European, Minoxidil user and Smoker (for about 12 years), slight overweight. No health conditions.

So far, after the first dose, I was tired for 2 days, a little bit of headache and hurting arm. Took the vaccine on Saturday at 8 AM and went to a party on the same day (didn't drink alcohol). On Sunday and Monday I was tired and had a mild headache.

After the second dose, which was this Saturday at 8 AM, felt really tired on Saturday, stayed in bed most of the day, slept well, and on Sunday I was fresh, went to a BBQ and no issues whatsoever. Also, arm doesn't hurt at all.

My parents also had their first dose on 15th of May and they had no side effects at all (except the hurting arm).

I am not trying to convince anyone to take the vaccine, we should all decide what's best for our bodies. I am just sharing my experience with the vaccine until now, as before taking them, I was quite nervous.

I've had a very intense, pounding, almost irregular heartbeat. And my head has felt like a balloon. Both of which combine to make it extremely difficult to focus, work, or concentrate. It's like there's a clenched fist on my left side, and my head is like a balloon. 

I'm going to a cardiologist tomorrow AM. 

I've seen reports that a very small % men 25-30 are having more severe symptoms, and experiencing things related to heart inflammation. Wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or knows more information - thank you!",1621858625.0,2021-05-24 05:17:05

I need some scientific input. I heard that changes in spike protein will render the virus incapable to make  entry inside the host cells. That's why Pfizer is capable of dealing with most variants of Corona virus because it produces anti spike protein antibodies. 
Can't coronavirus mutate its spike protein to enter host cells by altered mechanism and still remain unaffected by Pfizer anti spike antibodies?

6 hours post shot: still feel pretty much the same, except more fatigued. i dont feel bad just kinda like im slightly hungover w a sore arm.

morning after shot: i had a hard time staying asleep last night. my arm hurts worse today but i still feel okay otherwise, i did sweat a lot while sleeping though.

3 days post shot: first night i didn’t wake up drenched in sweat, feeling pretty much normal, been experiencing light chills/hot flashes, arm doesnt hurt unless i intentionally press on the spot that was injected lol. i feel like im in the clear as far as side effects for this dose but i will update again if i start feeling anything that could be related to the vaccine.

On the second day after I got my second Pfizer dose I started experiencing concerning pain that I could immediately recognize as having to do with the heart: chest pain, left side neck pain, shoulder, arm. I visited the ER and was immediately admitted due to having a troponin level of ""26""(unsure of the units). I did a CT, EKG, Ultrasound, X-Ray, and many blood tests. In the end I think the diagnosis was ""acute perimyocarditis"" from what I remember when I took a glimpse at the report, although the doctors were tossing around words like ""Myocarditis"", ""Pericarditis"", and ""Endocarditis"". I was released from the hospital two days later when my troponin levels settled down to a normal range.

Now the doctors are worried about abnormal liver results with elevated enzyme levels, more news on that to come soon as I had my blood taken today for another 14 or so tests.

By no means am I trying to discourage anyone from getting the vaccine, I still stand strong in my decision and encourage people to get vaccinated as it helps keep everyone safe.

They're testing for D-dimers, so I should know within 1 hour or so, if there is clotting or not. 

Some reassuring news - the doctor said alot of people like me have some to the emergency room and he personally hasnt discovered any clots. He said everything is so new, not even doctors know or understand all the symptoms patients are presenting with. He said literally everyone could experience either dose completely differently vs. the general guidance the government is giving. With Astrazeneca they say the 1st dose is harsher, for me the 2nd dose has been worse. Just goes to show how random it can be. 

Moral of the story - if in doubt, please seek medical care before posting on Reddit!

EDIT - Blood test came back negative my d-dimer was in the 300-350 range, which is considered ""normal"". Anything above 500 is considered to be clotting. Doctor said as its normal now, its extremely unlikely they any clotting will occur in the next few weeks.",1621828913.0,2021-05-23 21:01:53

Aside from the body odor change the side effects were pretty minimal overall lasting about 48 hours. We had covid prior and had some smell issues during covid. Strange thing is they had resolved months before the shot, and the shot brought back this very specific change. When we had covid we lost smell and it returned, but nothing really changed smell.

The reason I hadn't got the vaccine yet is because I'm quite scared of needles, and my fiance who works in the medical field has been fully vaccinated for a while, and convinced me that it's really not as scary as it seems. I walked into my local grocer pharmacy and got to choose which vaccine I wanted and it was administered within ten minutes, which was nice. I had my fiance and son come into the room with me to get the shot because I'm a baby. My heart was racing thinking the needle was going to hurt so I kept my eyes shut, and the next thing I know they said I was all done, I literally didn't even know I had a needle go into my arm. They made me wait around for 15 minutes to make sure I didn't have an allergic reaction and sent me on my way. I went for a pretty long bike ride later and felt completely normal. When we got home I started unloading the bikes and felt my arm becoming sore, and it definitely got worse throughout the evening and night, but wasn't horrible, just uncomfortable. I woke up this morning with a sore arm as well and throughout the day today it has gotten much better. As of now my arm is barely sore and getting better by the hour.

May 6, severe chest pain all along and just below breastbone as well as left chest. Anxiety attack. Full body muscle spasms for 2 hours. Went to hospital and doctor, cleared me of all cardiac problems, all bloodwork clear, lungs clear.

May 10, tooth pain suddenly in multiple teeth. Very bloated, nausea, lack of appetite. Tight abdomen, fullness/pressure/sometimes pain all along breastbone area. Very upset digestive tract. Very aware of my abdominal pulse. Muscle spasms continuing.

May 20, back pain, recurring tingling sensation along spine. Occasional stabbing pains in chest area. Shortness of breath with very minimal activity.

May 23, all of the above except for the uncontrollable shaking are still happening intermittently. No one has any explanation and everything they've checked for has come back negative.

"37/m 1. Astra Zeneca, 2 Biontech Pfizer",8,njhzmd,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/njhzmd/37m_1_astra_zeneca_2_biontech_pfizer/,4,"In Germany the vaccination of younger than 60 year old people first was done with Astra Zeneca, but then was switched over to Biontech Pfizer, so I got a crossvaccination. To my backstory, I seemed to have Covid in the end of 01/2020. As there was no covid at that time in Germany, I wasn't tested. So I'll never know if it really was Covid 19, but in retrospective the symptoms were exactly what you would expect (dry coughing, diarrhea, lost taste, fever, etc...).

However, this is how it went for me:

Astra Zeneca, 15th of March:
- dizziness for about 2 days
- took Ibuprofen 2 h after the shot
- first night I was shivering and waking up every 30 minutes with an extreme thirst. Around 03:00 I got up, because I couldn't sleep anymore
- second night I woke up after roundabout 2-3 h of sleep, totally soaked in sweat. Fresh clothes and the I sleeped until next morning.
That was more or less all of the symptoms, apart from a hurting arm for about one week.

Biontech Pfizer, 17th of May:
- no dizziness, a little hurt in the arm
- took paracetamol 6 h and 10 h after the shot, because of a slightly building headache
- first night: around midnight I felt a light shivering, but sleeped pretty well until next morning
- the day after vaccination I was more or less the walking dead... I felt like I had the worst flu ever... took some more paracetamol against the building headache. I was so tired and everything I did was just exhausting.
The the funny part came: Around 17:00 in the course of an hour all symptoms were gone. From totally f@#$ed up to ripping out trees in one hour? That was a strange experience.

Cool thing is, that this kind of crossvaccination is said to be the most potent combination for building antibodies, according to some British and Spanish studies. But also is said to have the worst side-effects.

All in all everything went well and I would definitely do it again.",1621834718.0,2021-05-23 22:38:38

First dose of Pfizer: went smooth,2,njsslk,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/njsslk/first_dose_of_pfizer_went_smooth/,1,"Hi guys, I'm a 24m who got the first dose on 20th of May and just wanted to share my experience.

After the shot a couple of hours later I felt the expected, slight arm soreness, on the next day I felt quite tired, so I had to take the day off work, but after  laying in bed for a while I definetly felt better.

The day after that(I think it was the third day) I felt great with barely any arm soreness, but had a very small lymph node swelling, not even noticeable unless I touched it with a bit of force, so around the afternoon/evening I was a 100% back to normal.

NOTE: on the second day after the jab I also felt this weird right side chest tightness close to the center which came and went for around 1 minute, idk why I had it, maybe something to do with my lungs(i used to have bronchitis in the past) or because I was a bit worried that something might happen from the vaccine, that may be some sort of anxiety reaction, who knows it may have been my heart but I really don't know.

I think what made me have enough courage to get the vaccine was mainly family members and a ton of research on the net, one of my relatives took it and had very mild symptoms like myself and I trust them a lot, so it is very important that I heard this info from a person I really trust and is from the same family tree as me, so I kinda assumed that if we have the similiar genetics then I would also probably be ok, so anyone who is scared of taking the jab, speak with someone who you trust and has taken the shot, it would be best if it is a family member who has taken the shot, ofcourse do a lot of research and think logically on what you should consider as the right decision.",1621872812.0,2021-05-24 09:13:32

Like 2 full vaccinations? 
I’m on a med that makes me immune compromised and my neurologist advised me to get the shot ASAP. Which was 4 weeks post infusion. I got it 3/18 and 4/15.
And now I’m learning that other neurologists are advising patients on this med wait 12 weeks post infusion and that the vaccine likely won’t work if you get it earlier or later because of how the med works. 
(The med is a twice yearly infusion so that means I only have 2 small windows a year to get  it)

2nd Dose Completed,1,njrxjx,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/njrxjx/2nd_dose_completed/,3,"I've now had both covid shots. Late 30's. Male.

1st shot resulted in mild soreness in my arm that later about an hour. That night, I had a restless sleep and strange dreams. I woke up early before the sun was up and had dancing circle patterns with moving squiggle lines in front of my eyes. The distortion lasted about 10 seconds, but was surprisingly vivid. After that, I hardly had any major symptoms, although I think my lymph nodes were a little swollen on and off. Towards the end of week 2, I did get some strong cramping in my legs and torso that woke me up at night.  Overall, it was fine.

2nd shot gave me pretty bad arm pain. I didn't really want to move my arm unless I had to, and I couldn't sleep on it. I slept lightly and keep having strange dreams. I felt like my body and mind were in a looping cycle, but knowing that I had taken the vaccine and wasn't actually ill made me feel comforted. That morning I felt off. Like I was hung over. I felt pretty feverish and couldn't work more than a few hours before I knew I'd have to sleep it off. I didn't take my temperature, but I'm pretty sure my fever was relatively high based on how I felt. I kept trying to get up and move around and then I'd fall asleep in weird places like the back deck. I had to keep taking ibuprofen to feel normal. By late afternoon, early evening I started to turn around and by the next day, I felt normal again. 

It's been about 5 days since shot 2. I'll report back if I get more symptoms. But on the whole, it's pretty much how I expected it would go, and I'm glad I did it. No pain, no gain. 😂✌",1621869013.0,2021-05-24 08:10:13

My arm also has been sore but at that point, I thought that along with a headache was the worst of it.

At 48 hours it wasn't gone. 


And now it's past 72 hours. Chills have set in today! Now I feel like I am worse than the first 2 days post vaccine.

Headache, chills, body aches, tiredness... That sums it up! No fever. My mom suggested maybe I caught something due to stress on my immune system.

But I am reading about side effects and seeing that all of these symptoms are side effects listed that may last for a few days.

It feels like I should have a fever but I don't have one.

My skin feels sensitive, too, mostly only back.

I don't have any congestion or cough. My nose has been a little sniffly and runny. I've been using nasal spray to keep breathing okay but usually that won't help a snuffy congested nose. 

So it feels worse than a typical cold but closer to the flu. Everyday I have been thinking that if be better starting with the next but have been wrong!

If my immune system was stressed, it was because this is a doozy of a vaccine. I personally don't believe I am sick with anything. It must just be side effects!

I'm just glad I don't have full blown covid or anything! 

My dad read older people tend to have less side effects. Both my parents got vaccinated the same day as me but are fine right now. My mom had a brief fever the first morning after the shot but that's about it other than the usual arm pain we all have (the arm where the injection was given).

What are some things people are doing to feel better? I just took ibuprofen for the first time. I also have been taking some kratom. My head hurts too much to do much other than just want to lie around again.

I have 2 young children 3 & 5 which makes it hard to keep up. I'm grateful my parents help out, as I am separated from their father.",1621827289.0,2021-05-23 20:34:49

Day 3 (On a Sunday) I decided to go to an emergency walk-in clinic was necessary . The lady did a EKG and said the readings look ok. She felt along my chest muscle and said she believed it to be muscle related rather than cardivascular and to contact my PCP the next day for blood work to confirm.


Day 4 woke up with very little symptoms. Muscle pinch here and there. Called my PCP for the blood work anyways per drs orders. 

Night 4 extreme bicep pain at injection site that has persist since present (Day 10)

I’m just over 2 weeks post 2nd dose of moderna and i’m super relieved for it to be over! The first dose i had nothing but a sore arm for about 24 hours..then had a slight migraine which went away after sleep.  2nd dose i had nothing until the 24 hour mark. at that point I had pretty strong fatigue, a low grade fever, and arm soreness for the rest of the day/night.

At night i picked up some mucinex night shift which helped with the fever and any inflammation and knocked me out for the night. woke up completely fine and haven’t had a symptom since.  My girlfriend had lesser symptoms than i did throughout the whole experience. If you’re still contemplating getting it, here’s my thoughts:

It’s safe and has been administered to millions of people at this point and any major common reactions have been noted and (j&j) stopped immediately.  As far as the FDA approval, if you take any supplements or vitamins, those aren’t fda approved either so whatever. It feels great having it be over with and able to somewhat put this whole thing behind me. If you decide to get it, definitely stay hydrated and load up on ibuprofen and i also recommend mucinex night shift, or some kind of night time fever reducer/sleepy mixture. while all of this may seem obvious, i just wanted to share my experience in hopes that if there’s anyone skimming this page like i was, reading bad reviews and trying to decide, it’s not all bad.

After searching through forums and posts about terrible side effects, I had thoroughly terrified myself. However, I knew that it would be for maybe three days, at the most. I went through various claims of how to reduce side effects, the main one being hydration. I never drink as much water as I should and don’t like the taste, so you KNOW it’s serious if I start chugging water. So, with my backstory concluded, here’s the rundown of symptoms and times to go with them!

First dose: Pfizer, only side effect was soreness and pain at injection site. Went away after 24 hours. 
 
Second dose: No symptoms all day. 
12 AM (9 hours later) extremely tired which is rare for me
Woke up at 8 am, even more rare. Couldn’t fall back asleep for the life of me. 
Throughout that day had a stomach ache and nausea and a bit of fatigue, but nothing that prevented me from normal activities

3 am next night, (36 hours after) extremely dizzy and light headed. I have never passed out in my life but felt really close to passing out. Went away after laying down and keeping still for about half an hour. 

As of posting this, I’m 82 hours post shot, so I think I’m clear to say I’m not having anymore side effects! All fatigue, nausea, and lightheaded stuff went away after about 50 hours. I think I would attribute my “success” at diverting side effects to hydration and the occasional Tylenol. So, if you’re nervous like me, hopefully this post gives you some more courage to get the shot! 

TLDR; I was more nervous than I should have been, nobody is going to have the same experience. Hydrate and take Tylenol or Motrin! This is your chance to give thanks to the frontline workers! It’s so worth it!",1621783846.0,2021-05-23 08:30:46

I'm a little nervous here. I got my first dose of pfizer 25 days ago and a few nights ago I noticed tiny blood spots (petechiae) scattered on my arms and upper chest. I'm a 28 yo female and I've never had this before nor do I have any history of blood disorders. 

They're very small but more are showing up slowly. I'm booked for a blood test early next week to check my platelets but I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience and what their test results were and if their side effects went away. 

Thanks guys!

Edit: I went to the ER last night and turns out my platelet count is fine! The nurses and doctor were unconcerned and almost dismissive haha. I'll still be getting my previously scheduled blood work just to double check.

I've also developed other symptoms like soreness in my arm socket as though I've worked out really hard, which I haven't. So so so weird.

Edit 2:

Got a second, more thorough blood test with my GP and red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelets, etc. all came out normal! 

I'm advised to watch the petechiae and if they don't fade away in a month I'll be referred to a specialist. 

I still believe that it's a side effect of the vaccine, as I have no other explanation currently, and the only new thing my body has been introduced to most recently is the shot. 
Thanks for all your concern, guys!",1621743646.0,2021-05-22 21:20:46

Fully Vaccinated: Experiences from Both Shots,5,niqy41,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/niqy41/fully_vaccinated_experiences_from_both_shots/,2,"Hi all,

Just thought I'd add my (F, 38) experiences getting both doses of the Moderna vaccine.

My first shot was on 4/18, and I was extremely nervous. Thankfully, it went well. I had a sore arm and some slight body aches, but everything cleared up within 24 hrs. 

My second shot was on 5/16, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I've heard some people can get really intense side effects from the second dose, so I planned to be out of commission for a day or two. Thankfully, though, it didn't end up being as bad as I thought, though I had more side effects than I did from the first shot. Basically, my arm was extremely sore for a day. I also had a 100.5 fever, some mild chills, and some mild aches. Maybe a little bit of nausea, too, but it was tolerable. My side effects lasted about 24 hrs total, but they probably peaked twelve hours after the shot.

So yeah, just thought I'd add my experience. All in all, it wasn't too bad at all, and I'm glad I'm fully vaccinated.",1621742971.0,2021-05-22 21:09:31

So when the vaccines first rolled out I was hardcore in the ""no way"" camp, but after my whole family got the Pfizer shots with basically zero symptoms, I'm starting to lose my apprehension. I've just had a few questions, and have been unable to find any info to answer them. Can anyone help me out?

1. I've already gotten COVID. It was awful for like 2-3 days but I'm better, and haven't gotten sick since. What would the vaccine do for me that natural immunity doesn't?
2. I've heard a couple different conflicting arguments, but the general consensus is that natural immunity only lasts for so long. I'm not really the germophobe/hypochondriac type, so besides wearing a mask I don't really do anything different. In theory, wouldn't I be getting continually exposed, and if so, why would my immunity diminish?
3. I'm really not that well-read on the newfangled MRNA/Viral vector vaccine tech, but I understand that they're pretty much A-OK. I'm still not super comfortable with the idea, though. Why are there no traditional ""dead virus"" vaccines like Polio or Hep A? Alternatively, if there are, what are they, and are they available in the US?

I'm particularly interested in learning more about questions 2 and 3 here. I'd be much more willing to just get it over with if there exists a more ""old school"" (if you can call it that) vaccine, but if I'm limited to the MRNA ones, I think I may wait a little longer and just keep letting my body do its thing. I'm just not comfortable with it yet, and the posts I read on here don't make it any easier.

Listen, I've read the figures, I know it's incredibly rare, but my illogical and sometimes irrationally anxious mind is telling me that I'm probably going to be one of the seven men in the country that gets a clot.

Secondly, with the other two offerings, having to suffer flu like symptoms not once, but twice would also leave me an anxious wreck...so I've scheduled an appointment for J&J on Monday. 

The point of this post is just to ask y'all for any reassurance/good experiences you've had with this vaccine, especially if you fit my demographic.

I literally drank (not in one go of course) close to 8L the first day. I was parched + I was also consciously drinking water as per medical advice. And it helped a lot! Water up, guys!

Hi! 25 year old female and Just got my first dose of Astrazeneca on May 18. Within an hour after the shot, noticed that I started to feel very thirsty for some reason, and mild discomfort on the vaccine site.

First night, had low grade fever, extreme thirst, general body malaise, calf pain on both legs (like one you'd get after a day of running or exercise) and fatigue. Drank lots of water, vitamin C, a paracetamol and went to sleep.

Woke up the next morning (May 19) feeling like death. Symptoms from the night before were magnified, especially the pain on both calves. I was starting to get scared because calf pain could be indicative of a blood clot, but asking my friends who took the shot on the same day said they all felt calf pain, had me relieved. Did nothing for 24 hrs except to sleep, wake up to eat, pee, or drink water. Didn't even take a bath.

On May 20 woke up feeling significantly better. Took a bath. Got some work done. But still had some traces of body pain especially on the calves again. And this day is the last day of me feeling the side effects. But until today May 22, I still feel more thirsty than I usually would normally.

Hope this helps anyone else feel at ease knowing that it usually just takes 2-3 days for the side effects to subside.",1621718489.0,2021-05-22 14:21:29

may 18, tuesday - got the shot.

day 1: arm soreness, fever, fatigue. headache.

day 2: fever died, had bad diarrhea. bad to wake up at three in the morning for this. couldn't sleep because of chills, i defecated again two hours later. only ate bananas. headache. felt like my skull was being cracked open. took 1/2 paracetamol.

day 3, may 20: sore arm, muscle aches, no fever but similar feeling, chills, couldn't sleep, loss of appetite and lightheadedness. dizziness (vertigo?) was only told to take paracetamol and that's it when i got the shot. so, another 1/2 paracetamol.

day 4, may 21: chills, couldn't sleep. headache has faltered. only the dizziness. loss of balance. stumbling while walking. muscle aches.

day 5, may 22: diarrhea is gone but only because i haven't had the appetite. chills are still taking over. not a pleasant feeling. cold sweat, took my anxiety medication to calm me down. (1/2 of klonopin) also note: taking (1/2) of paracetamol for my headaches. i take 1/2 of any pills because my body is sensitive to medications. started menstruation.

day 6, may 23: the menstruation is REALLY bad. i'm surprised it's not listed as one of the side effects because a lot of logs I read from Tumblr and several friends i know had their periods last for a week to 12 days. or just super heavy and people who are in BCP are experiencing cramps.

Second shot: got my shot at Noon. Everything was fine, arm wasn’t even sore until about 9pm that day. Around midnight hell rose. Around 12 hours after the second dose I immediately got cold shivers and very bad back aches. No fever or headache at this point. I went to bed thinking it would go away, throughout the night the shivers and body aches continued and in the morning I woke up with a headache/migraine. The body aches had lessened just a bit but the headache had took over and both were still unbearable so I took medicine. After being awake for 1-2 hours the body aches got worse again. Also these body aches were like I got hit by a car or a bus. Felt like to medicine was not helping, the whole day went by and I was in bed and could not do anything. It hurt to be in bed or to get up! Around 7pm the following day I started to run a fever. About 100-101 which lasted up until midnight. I took Tylenol again and I think that helped since at midnight my fever started to go down. I started sweating crazily to the point my whole shirt was wet with sweat.

AZ vaccine,3,nil3db,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nil3db/az_vaccine/,9,"Hello all,  

I hope everyone is doing okay! I have a situation that has gotten me really nervous, and some words of encouragement or assurance would be amazing.   

I (27, F) live in Germany, and while vaccinations are speeding up dramatically, the only vaccines ""readily"" available are AZ, and J&J. I really would like to get this done now, in order to be fully vaccinated by the end of August, because I need to head back into the hospital for a follow-up procedure from last December (some of you might remember haha), which is completely normal and part of the protocol. I would absolutely love to be fully vaccinated by the time I have to step into a hospital again.   

I managed to get an appointment for the AZ vaccine this coming week (Thursday), and I feel relief, but also, I am very nervous. I have the data, I look at the numbers, but I guess that the media and the news really made a great job at demonizing this particular vaccine. My scientific side (I studied Biology) is screaming to me that I should not worry beyond the normal reported side effects, but my not so scientific, anxiety driven side is screaming about the blood clot issues and the worst possible outcomes.  I also have talked to my endocrinologist, as I take hormones (not due to birth control, but because of hormonal inbalances), and I have been told that not only has there been no shown correlation bewteen hormonal therapies and blood clotting related to the vaccine, but also that my method of intake (patches) also does not increase the risk of thrombosis since it is absorbed through the skin.   

Anyone under similar cirsumstances has gotten Vaxzevria? What should I expect? Vaccinations with all vaccines don't open until June here, which would be too late, and also finding an appointment will be impossible. I really want to get this over with, but I am also nervous due to my health anxiety, despite looking at the numbers.   

How have people coped?

That was about 2 hours ago and ever since it happened the same arm feels weird.

I went through 12 tampons in a single day I was considering calling a doctor because I couldn't function like a normal human. Then it hit me, it was the shot. This plus the nose bleed which are so abnormal for me must be from the shot. Now I'm nervous to get the second dose. Has anyone had any similar issues. I feel like maybe im being paranoid",1621679660.0,2021-05-22 03:34:20

I've discovered this subreddit today and I would like to share my experience with AZ/OX vaccine. Since I'm Brazilian and this was posted originally on my Twitter, I'll try to translate it to english, so I'm already anticipating some grammar errors. 
That's the thread I've posted:

-Until 12h after the vaccine, very mild symptom of asthenia.

-12h after the vaccine, arm sore in a median form, mild asthenia.

-16h after, temperature rise (36.9 ° C), mild-moderate asthenia, mild delirium during sleep, insomnia in the middle of the night *

*episode treated with 1g of dipyrone sodium, general improvement after 2 hours of oral administration of the drug)

-27h after vaccine and 10h after the administration of dipyrone, good general condition, without fever or other side effects.

-36h after vaccination, mild asthenia returns, I had mild headache that is reducing with time and does not need drug treatment, and the deltoid muscle is still sore.

-48h after vaccination, good general condition, absence of asthenia and headache (which were previously present). The only symptom that is still present is mild pain at the application site (Deltoid Muscle).

My sore arm only lasted few more days (probably by the end of that week I was at my 100%) 

I'm still very happy even after almost a month of getting the shot, and also, no more side effects. I'll have my second shot at the end of July, probably I'll come back to bring you guys some hope, if that's what some people are looking for.

"Strong reaction from moderna #2, would do it again.",2,nigwgz,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nigwgz/strong_reaction_from_moderna_2_would_do_it_again/,3,"40's/F.  So two days ago I got my #2 Moderna jab.  I had no reaction at all, zero, from #1 but wasn't sure what to expect so planned and arranged to take it easy for a few days after #2 and I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have been able to do much.

I got #2 and had to do quite a few tasks that were stressful and annoying before I got home but already maybe 3 or 4 hours afterward my arm was starting to get very sore.

Then it got to the point where I couldn't pick up my arm at all.  Then, starting with my legs, I experienced a strange burning/bruised feeling and by that night I was in entirely so much pain that it hurt to touch anything...my bed, chairs, it even hurt to wear clothes (which is how I saw pain from actual COVID described a lot.)

I also got the ""COVID arm"" reaction, a massive hot hive-like thing, at the injection site that I read happens a good majority of the time (+80%) especially in non-elderly people.

Sleeping was a really really bad time overnight.

By the next day I was still in a lot of pain and was such a mess all I could do was lay in bed most of all day long sleeping on and off.  I couldn't eat very much or I wafraid i'd get sick.  UGH!

Now at Day 3 that's 80%ish gone except the huge red hive reaction on my arm.  Still a tiny bit tired and I just woke up and can't wait to go back to bed already.  

All that written, I still encourage everyone to GO GET THE VAX.  As I was looking at that enormous hive on my arm I am eternally thankful that that thing was on my arm and didn't start out in my lungs.  If this is how bad the reaction is to the vax then I don't EVER want the real thing.  

Let me also put it this way for the vax hesitant:  I'm glad I was actually able to *plan* on not feeling well rather than waking up morning with something awful because I hung out too long with someone else that either didn't know or didn't care they had a disease.

This is also to tell vax hesitant people that YES i had a very strong reaction, but also YES I am still extremely glad and grateful I got the vaccine and would do it all over again.",1621712922.0,2021-05-22 12:48:42

His shot barely hurt too, didn’t even notice that the nurse put the needle in. Totally fine the next days

20F — Me, who hasn’t had covid got it a bit worse. My actual shot did sting and I definitely felt it but nothing terrible. I made sure to move my arm around aka spinning it in circles after, seems like I didn’t do it enough bc that shit hurt only a couple hours later. Before going to sleep my head would feel kinda tingly in specific spots (right above the ears) not sure if this is vaccine related. The next day my arm hurt a lot more, maybe I have a low pain tolerance lol. I also got headaches and didn’t have any appetite but I still ate. 

I should’ve been drinking more water! I found it helped the next day head pains (mainly felt in my forehead area) and so did a cold pack on my head. I’m not a fan of taking Tylenol (bc I don’t like swallowing pills) but I caved and it made me feel so much better, don’t be stubborn like me. For some reason my body feels super sensitive? 

That’s about it, hopefully day 3 I feel better

It’s taken three days for the soreness and aches to subside and for Tylenol to no longer be needed. I really couldn’t drive that first day but these past two I can reasonably function. I’m thankful my experience has been as I expected and not as bad as many posted here.

Here is my story. (53M) 5'6 157#  On meds for high B.P. I can provide my CDC card if your a doubter.

Ever had an antibiotic shot in the hip? That knot that last's a few day's? The sore arm is like 100 times **LESS**. Ever bounce into a door jam and 10 minutes later you go,,,wow, that's still a tad sore. 

**April 29, 2021:** Walmart - Montgomery, AL - Pfizer - 1st shot

\*really cool Pharmacist. She could tell I was nervous. She was excellent. Alcohol to the left arm, applied the donut band-aid and then,,,,,,OK..Your done. Ummm, what? Your done, sit outside for 15 mins, I'll check on you. And she did, every few minutes, she poked her head out and gave me a smile. She sent me on my way. I grabbed some Ramen on sale and headed home. I'm single and like cheap Ramen.

Woke up the next morning and I could tell I had the shot. It didn't hurt, but it felt, well, not sore, but if I poked it, it was sore. Hard to explain. No fever, no chills, no headache. Not shit. That was it.

**May 20, 2021:** Walmart - Montgomery , AL - Pfizer - 2nd shot

I knew I was in for a world of hurt. Everything I have read said,, the 2nd shot is awful. The internet does not lie. This is gonna suck!!! I almost backed out, but a friend had the beer virus and lost taste and smell for over a month. I like cold beer and good food, so I put on my big boy shorts and headed in.

I grabbed a case of bud-lite, some power aid, 3 cans of soup (family size), milk, Lay's wavy chips and some sandwich stuff. I figured I would be down for maybe 2 days.

Loaded my zombie apocalypse food in my truck (We drive trucks in Alabama) and headed back in for the needle. The really cool Pharmacist was on duty again. This was a good sign. After a few minutes of cooling my heels, she called me in. Same ole same ole. Wipe, band-aid, boom, your done. Go chill. She remembered me. This was around 2:30 P.M.

So I crashed around 9 P.M. 

I woke up around 7 A.M. today. My arm was still attached. No fever, no chills. I poked the shot location. **Hey dude, don't do that.** I got up, not foggy. Hmmm, something is wrong. I'm not feeling like shit....I will fix this. I took a day off just to be sick DAMMIT!!!!!

I shower, grab some short's and decide to do yard work so I can go fishing tomorrow. I'll get this sick stuff over with. I cut the yard, break out the weed eater and to top it off, the backpack blower. I'm done by noon. DAMMIT, I don't feel sick....

I do the only thing that makes sense in Alabama, I crack a beer and decide on my next steps.

Fast forward: I just got home from San Marco's. Me and some friends went out to eat. My arm is less sore than from my first shot. I have decided.... The internet will lie. But this is true. I'll update in a day or so, but I doubt I will need to.

Reasoned taking it this late in the period had least chance of influencing anything since most of the hormone changes are leveled out by now. 

Shot around 12 pm, bought some hair products with the coupon, felt like the person who gave me the shot was a bit harsh, my shoulder joint (not just the muscle) hurt for 3-4 hours pretty badly. Took precautionary aspirin, 2naproxen 220 mg, 1 Benadryl. Was somewhat dizzy as I got home and since I had cashed in sick time I took a nap. I SHOULD have played monster hunter with my newly freed time but oh well. Nap lasted 4 h.


Woke up, felt dizzy, assumed it was from not eating. I ate even though I didn’t really feel like it, continued feeling dizzy. We’re not talking dizzy like “I’m going to fall down and hit my head any moment”... more like looking at the ceiling and then looking back at the floor would make the room spin a little bit, not dizzy enough to feel driving was dangerous. 


5/18- took precautionary aspirin, 2 naproxen, 1 Benadryl


5/19- took precautionary aspirin, 2 naproxen. Some violent uterus cramps but not incapacitating. I’ve had much worse when my periods decide to fuck me over (We’re talking sitting next to the toilet wondering if I should sit and drop a blood octopus or throw up from the pain... this was nothing).


5/20- took precautionary aspirin, 2 naproxen. Uterus started cramping rather violently again. 


5/21- took precautionary aspirin, forgot naproxen, period started a whole 10 h ago and I’m not dying yet so hope I’m out in the clear. saving the naproxen for closer to bed. 


Never spiked a fever but that’s also probably because all these things also suppress fever. Never really felt utterly weird. I was surprised by the dizziness since I didn’t see that mentioned anywhere.


Update 5:26: period was ever so slightly worse than usual, a heavy bleed one day longer than usual, but stopped before day 5 anyway.



I will continue taking 1 aspirin, 2 naproxen all the way to 4 weeks post shot because I already had a blood clot once after 60 days of birth control in my life (non life threatening clot) and they basically just pumped me up full of naproxen for 3 weeks and sent me home and billed me a stupid huge ER bill for OTC Aleve and Aspirin.

Before taking the vaccine she had pain in her joints, not too bad. After taking it, she has been struggling to walk, and has survivor pain and struggles to do things without painkillers, to begin with she didn’t think it was a side effect as the pain started before taking it, but she has met a woman who shared a similar experience. Hoping she’ll feel better soon, and won’t have bad side effects after the second shot.

Vaxxed and incredibly thankful,1,nibbv8,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nibbv8/vaxxed_and_incredibly_thankful/,4,"This pandemic has been the hardest and most trying time for my family and I. Last year my uncle who I was very close with passed away alone in the ICU without any family. Lockdown took a huge toll on my wife who was pregnant at the time. She was incredibly sick for 2 trimesters and the social isolation from family and friends at such a crucial time was excruciating. We essentially never left the house except for essentials. Luckily we were able to work from home. Being stuck inside for such a long time along with everything else took a huge mental toll on us and we were both diagnosed with depression and anxiety. We tried to go outside to go on walks/hikes but my wife was usually too sick and not enough people wore masks outside where we could walk and we couldn't afford to risk it. To make mattes worse my in-laws are from a small town in Montana and are very pro-trump anti-science and not concerned about covid. Throughout the year they constantly wanted to come visit us to help and we kept having to say no. Constantly we would get texts with conspiracy YouTube and Facebook videos trying to persuade us we weren't in grave danger because of the global pandemic. 


We had our baby during the worst of the pandemic during the winter. The very concept of having to spend time at a hospital that was also full of covid patients was absolutely terrifying. Thankfully everything went well and we were so happy to have him in the world with us yet it was so sad for our family to not be able to meet him for months. 

Our first baby was supposed to be this joyful event with family yet that was all taken away from us because of our country's failure to unite, mask up and stay home. It was frustrating to see so many selfish people in our area not taking this pandemic seriously while we were literally taking every caution to protect our new family.


Finally last month we both had the opportunity to take the vaccine. My inlaws tried really hard to talk us out of it, especially since my wife is breastfeeding. A few of my friends had some side effects from it and a relative almost passed away from clots. Yet despite all that we decided to take a stand against this killer virus. That second jab was probably the most emotional event in our lives. It was a beacon of light and hope. It was freedom. After a year and a half in isolation we could finally see our family again and allow our son to meet his extended family. We even went on our first road trip/vacation! 

Despite the CDC's recent guidelines we will be keeping our distance and masking because you never know who else out there could use more protection. Honestly this vaccine is one of the greatest scientific advancements in our day and it is a shame people like my inlaws are denying themselves safety and protection and persuading others not to participate. It doesn't matter that it is ""experimental"" and can have side effects the risks of covid are so much greater and if everyone gets it we can beat this virus and finally go back to normal!",1621689075.0,2021-05-22 06:11:15

I (21 F, 5’8 145 lbs- Ehlers-Danilo’s Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia, but generally pretty healthy otherwise) got my second Pfizer shot yesterday. Prior to my first shot, I was doomscrolling like crazy, totally psyching myself out about getting vaccinated even though I’m 100% pro-vax. I was so scared of bad side effects. First shot, only had a sore arm. Second shot, sore arm and the tiniest bit of a headache, but the weather has been funky and it might just be allergies. Even if you get sick for a few days, it’s much better than ending up disabled/dead from covid or giving it to vulnerable people who can’t get vaccinated. I’m going to get to visit my parents in Europe this summer because I got vaccinated! I haven’t seen them since January of 2019, I’m stoked!

My second point is probably more important. Correlation does not equal causation. A symptom you have weeks after your shot, or even in the days following, is not necessarily caused by the vaccine. People get sick and have health problems ALL the time, for a myriad of reasons regardless. With the amount of people getting vaccinated daily, obviously a percentage of those people will have health events afterward that are unrelated. It’s like the bell’s palsy ordeal- the people who got it after being vaccinated got it at the same rate as the normal population. I developed vertigo two weeks after my first shot, and it didn’t even cross my mind that it might be vaccine related. It ended up being caused by a bad head cold and I’m better now. I got my second shot, and unless your doctor tells you otherwise, so should you!",1621653067.0,2021-05-21 20:11:07

Im just writing this here as a record to note down any adverse effects in the following month. The first vaccine gave me actinic and angular cheilitis at the same time 1.5 weeks after taking the vaccine, and took 1 month to heal.

I mentioned the cheilitis to my doc but there was no mention of it being caused by the vaccine, although I saw that cheilitis was on the adverse effects symptoms that the UK gov reports on each month.

The process went well, was in and out in 20 mins. Starting to feel a bit run down, lack of energy, hit by a bus feeling, but nothing major. I was told the effects can get worse in the next 2 to 3 days. Lets see.

MAY 21 2021

Last night I was very tired so slept early. Woke up today still a bit tired with a slight headache. I have noticed that my lip problem I got after my 1st vaccine is starting again. A little patch of dry skin on my upper lip. I presume that it will spread to big scales of dry skin across my lips as actinic cheilitis and maybe angular cheilitis if it forms cuts in the corner of my mouth again.

To me this tells me it is definitely a reaction to the vaccine, only its showing a day after as opposed to 1.5 weeks after like the first vaccine.

Going to keep this diary to update. As for diet, I ate plant based yesterday, a salad wrap, chips, hummus and for dinner I had quorn dinosaur nuggets.

MAY 23 2021

Yesterday, on May 22 I had a slight headache all day. I have felt fine today except for one thing I just noticed now. There is a small purple / red bump  on the end of my ring finger on my left hand. It hurts a little when I put a lot of pressure on it. The pain in my arm of the injection site is almost gone. Im worried about this thing on my finger. I feel really depressed also from these reactions. My lip thing I mentioned is still there but it hasnt progressed. In terms of diet Im nit eating plant based.

I felt fine for that night, with the exception of a sore arm (which I've had after every vaccine in my lifetime). The following day, I woke up and was welcomed with violent body aches, chills, and waves of nausea. None of these reactions were severe enough to visit a walk-in, and I just slept through it. The day after, I felt very near back to normal, just with some slight body aches left over. Was completely back to normal after that.

Yesterday, I received my second dose, and my reactions were far less severe than my first dose. I have mild to moderate body pain, occasional chills, but that's where it stops.

I just want to be able to do whatever I want again IF (big IF) they start making vaccines mandatory.

Feels like... I'm getting all of them. So far: dizzyness, extreme fatigue, leg pain, pain/swelling near shot area, chest pain, difficulty breathing, fever, wheezing, shivering, feeling nauseous. You name it, I'm going through it right now. And it only seems to be getting worse.

Like 30 minutes ago I lied down and then legitimately could not get up for 10 minutes (I am usually fit enough to do a LOT of situps) until I finally got up by rolling off the bed and putting my feet under me.

I feel super weak, I can barely even type (thank god for dictation + auto correct).

I know symptoms are normal, but when I looked them up it says:

""You should seek medical attention right away if you 
have any of the following symptoms after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine:
• Shortness of breath,
• Chest pain,
• Leg swelling,
• Persistent abdominal pain,
• Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision,
• Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection.""

My vision is only slightly blurred (could be something else as I wear contacts) and I haven't checked the site of injection (read below paragraph, just looking at it makes me feel faint) but I have all the rest. 

I originally thought it was a panic attack (I am deathly afraid of the medical needles and have passed out in the past when getting blood drawn) but its been like 12h so I doubt it.

Please be kind if I am asking dumb questions, I already feel pretty shitty and am alone in my dumb apartment and it's 2am and hospitals are closed and don't really know if all this is normal. It's scary going to bed knowing that if I suddenly feel worse during the night I do not have anyone I can call out for help.

I'm just making this post to give anyone who's curious an update as to what it's like for my experience after my first dose of Pfizer, within three days. This is in no way an anti-vaxxer rant or complaining. Just as information for those experiencing similar things and are curious or those who want to know about possible side effects.

Day 1: After I received my shot, I was immediately fine. As I went home, the only thing I had experienced was a slightly sore arm.

Day 2: The morning I woke up, my arm was excruciatingly painful, I believe this was because I slept on that arm but might be wrong. A few hours after I woke up I had thrown up, only once. Throughout the rest of the day, I experienced a relatively normal fever and some diarrhea episodes. That same night, I was experiencing some lower back pain that could only be helped with propping up a pillow under my back.

Day 3: Was still experiencing slight arm discomfort and same fever. Was a bit thirsty throughout the day. Again, not sure if this is directly related to the vaccine.

Day 4 (Today): I am currently experiencing no symptoms or side effects whatsoever. The only way my arm hurts is if I push on it, but other than that, all is good.

I hope someone has found comfort with relating to my symptoms or is relieved from the lack of severe symptoms. If anyone has any questions of further curiosity into my experience, I'm more than willing to help out.

I found articles about BPPV and did the Epley maneuver for my right side, as I had room spinning after the self diagnostic test. I can't say it helped. 

I saw my doctor that Thursday, the 13th, and he can't link it to anything but the vaccine, and possibly allergies. I had a recent blood panel too, and everything is normal. He said to come back if it gets worse or new symptoms surface, but other than that, it could last 8-12 weeks. It's very minor, but it still happens sometimes when I turn over in bed suddenly, and at random times while walking, and lasts maybe a minute, but no more than 10.

My first dose I felt fine just a little bit tired so I wasn’t really nervous about the second dose. I received the second dose Sunday the 16th at 12pm and besides my arm hurting all I really felt was a bit tired. 
Monday which was the next day I woke up feeling horrible. I had super high fever, nausea, muscle soreness , I couldn’t even keep my eyes open or move them because of the pain and pressure. Also want to add I had horrible neck pain which felt similar to a neck sprain where I couldn’t turn either side of my neck without feeling pain and it went to my shoulders and upper back. It was a rough day and I took Tylenol which helped a bit. 
Tuesday I felt a lot better but I still had on and off nausea, a slight headache, and my neck/shoulders still were hurting really bad. 
Wednesday I wake up with my neck in excruciating pain and a horrible migraine. I get migraines and was surprised it took this long to show up after the vaccine but it happened unfortunately. I was throwing up, diarrhea, and just overall in horrible pain. Nothing worked and by the time the migraine finished I was left with a slight headache and the same neck pain I was feeling. 
Today Thursday which is now 4 days after the vaccine I do feel better overall but I’m concerned because the slight headache is still there along with the neck pain and upper shoulder which is now on the right side instead of both sides and throbbing up to my ear ?
Is anyone else experiencing this or something similar ?

I prepared extensively for a bad night. I bought a couple jars of Powerade, food that doesn't require cooking, got a fan and a heating pad, the works. I was fully expecting to be hit by the proverbial bus.

Worse, I have chronic anemia, and the week leading up to my appointment I had a bunch of symptoms of low blood oxygen. I was worried that the potential for myocarditis and pericarditis was going to make my heart act up since I was already getting tachycardia and palpitations. I had planned that if I felt any discomfort in my chest at all I was going to lie down and avoid exerting myself when at all possible. Hell, since the arm pain for my first shot kicked in after about two hours, I worried that I would get these worse symptoms prematurely and be caught out feeling terrible. Pair all these issues with my health anxiety and lack of insurance and I was decidedly apprehensive about the whole ordeal.

Yesterday I got the jab, and I was just waiting for the symptoms to kick in, chugging water and avoiding undue stress. Now, twenty-four hours in and I seem to have the bare minimum of symptoms. My arm is sore, more bruised than anything since they seemingly nicked a blood vessel while sticking me. I did bleed straight through my bandage. I also got a headache and muscle stiffness, both of which are difficult to ascribe specifically to the vaccine since I had stayed up late doing chores the previous night, winding up with about four hours of physical activity (mopping, laundry, taking out trash, scrubbing counters, etc.) and five hours of sleep. I don't doubt that the headache and stiffness were worse due to the vaccine, but I likely would have had them anyway.

Now I've got a bunch of snacks uneaten, episodes unbinged, and chapters unread. I was so worried about being caught with my pants down by the side effects that I spent several days preparing. Now I don't know what to do with myself since I barely feel worse than before the shot.

Just thought I'd share my experience since I thought it was funny, plus it doesn't hurt to have some more positive stories out there.

Pfizer vaccine heart palpitations,21,ngs03s,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/ngs03s/pfizer_vaccine_heart_palpitations/,31,"I wanted to be one of the few coming back to this sub to reassure people that vaccine was safe and worth it, but it will have to be a longer post.

I am not anti-vaxx at all, but it still took me a week of reading through articles and studies about the safety of the mRNA vaccines, before I made the decision to take it. I trust science, I trust my engineers colleagues who all were ""rushing"" to get it, they probably did even more elaborate research than me on the topic. But I still think the vaccines have been rushed to save the economy and go back to full-speed consumerism as fast as possible. And the waiver you have to sign isn't really a sign of confidence from the authorities. They should instead say they will cover any costs due to adverse effects, but hey, big pharma needs to make mo' money.

I am 34M, healthy although not practicing any sport. Almost underweight, probably not at risk.
If I had continued with my current situation, which is being completely isolated, no family, no friends, just living with my wife and walking the dog, I would probably not have taken it. But I am flying soon and moving back to my home country to live closer to my parents, so I decided to stay safe and get the shots. I wish confinement could have been enough to stop the pandemic, but it was clear vaccines were the only way to see my parents without being afraid of killing them. They are selfish boomers who still don't want to get vaccinated although they are are old and at risk, they are waiting for herd immunity, throwing younger generations under the bus is apparently not a problem for them (if the vaccines are as dangerous as they think it is). 
My wife also decided to not take it because she already has enough health issues and painful menstruations. We haven't had kids yet, and she doesn't wait to take anything that could mess with her hormones even more. She didn't feel like it and trusted her instincts, I respect her decision.

So I felt I had to be the responsible guy of the bunch, who does his duty to protect others, and I have no regret for that.

First shot of Pfizer: sore arm 6 hours after injection, for less than 48 hours. I was not able to sleep on my arm on the first night, but that was it. Nothing bad at all.
Most likely a coincidence and due to a recent cleaning at the dentist, but the next day, a tooth that had been sensitive for a while started to become extremely painful, radiating in the entire left side of my mouth to the point that the dentist and I were not able to determine which tooth was the problem. After a week, the pain gets more precise as the nerve is dying inside the tooth, I get a root canal treatment and everything is fine again.
I started to get random and minor heart palpitations and a bit of depression, but I also can't say it was related to the vaccine, I have been stressed at work and with the move, and the idea of getting my visually-fine-but-dead front tooth drilled away to put a crown didn't help.

Second shot of Pfizer: Sore arm a couple of hours after injection, but a lot less painful than during the first shot, I was able to sleep on it fine.
10 hours after the shot, I start getting fever, up to 102F, and chills, muscle aches in the middle of the night. But I know it's expected and will go away quickly, a friend had to exact same symptoms. 24 hours after I started to get fever, I feel just fine, light headaches but that's all, my temperature is back to normal.
After a couple of days I start noticing heart palpitations again, but they are more frequent. Again, I think it's because of stress, I have had that in the past during a painful breakup.
I wait a few days and start noticing chest pain, like my heart burns, pounds hard and sometimes accelerates for no reason. I get some random sharp pain in the heart when breathing, stronger headaches, random but rare tingling in the arm and neck. I feel tired. It's not painful enough to be too alarming, but it's constant so I can't blame stress anymore. Symptoms look like myocarditis, so I get an appointment with the doctor the next day.

We are 7 days after the 2nd dose: Blood pressure is fine, Blood oxygenation is good, EKG doesn't show anything, blood test results are good, nothing on the chest X-ray. The doctor is reassuring, he says that maybe it's just a temporary adverse effect, but doesn't notice any heart condition.

It's 1 day after the tests and I keep feeling the same heart burn, I also feel a lot more tingling, everywhere in my body now. Legs, thighs, even in the belly and kidneys. It's not painful enough to go to the emergency, I can work fine (computer work at home). I am waiting for an appointment with a cardiologist to do some heart monitoring.

The goal of my post is not to scare you from getting the vaccine, you will probably be fine and if you are at risk of getting COVID, it will always be better than the real virus. However, listen to your body and get checked by a doctor if you get any weird symptoms after the vaccine. There is nothing wrong with being cautious, I just hope you have a good health insurance if you live in the US.

Update: more blood test results came back, and there is 1 negative result: TSH levels are slightly low, half of what it was 7 months ago. We kinda knew that the vaccine was messing with hormones from what women could experience with their menstruation cycles, it looks like it's affecting my hormones as well. And guess what are the symptoms for low TSH? Irregular or rapid heartbeat, palpitations, muscle weakness, irritability or anxiety, tremors, change in menstrual patterns. Looks like we have a bingo! I'll see what the doctors will say after the ultrasounds of my heart and chest.",1621517957.0,2021-05-20 06:39:17

It’s been nearly 20 days since the second shot with no end in sight. My doctor can only tell me that it “should stop soon.” Not particularly comforting. The unnerving truth is, they just don’t know.

If I caught Covid-19 i most likely wouldn’t even know according to reports for my age group. So why would i put something in my body that seems to be hurting people of my age group when catching covid most likely wouldn’t have any effect? (and i dont have an 100% chance of catching covid but if i get vaccinated i have a strong chance of having side effects). I could potentially see problems for months based on what I’ve seen here! 

What i truly fail to understand is that if the people who are in immediate danger from covid get the vaccine, then shouldn’t it not matter if i get it as a healthy young man? If 50 percent of the population already has the vaccine then herd immunity is starting to kick in, and if all the people who could have a potentially deadly encounter with covid-19 are vaccinated then what good does it do for me to have it too? I just see it as a last resort option, if i were in a high risk category it would be a no brainer but everyone around me who isn’t high risk is seemingly taking the vaccine and getting ill or having some kind of side effect where if they caught covid they would be totally fine and maybe not even notice! I also read that natural occurring anti-bodies are more effective than antibodies created by unnatural means(aka. Vaccines). 

Not only that, but my buddies who have been vaccinated are all getting worried based on trends on social media. Its pretty apparent that we aren’t entirely sure the effects that this vaccine has on the body. I also feel that we aren’t be transparent! A lot of women on this page alone are complaining of changes in their menstrual cycles and hormones but when you look it up on google every article says that they aren’t being effected by the vaccine in any way. The numbers are speaking for themselves in my opinion! Not only this but covid is a mutating virus so it seems that you would need to get another harmful shot every several months to a year to even be protected!


Ps. The quarter sticking to the site of the vaccine injection thing is as real as me and my buddies could tell. We tried disproving it for hours to no avail. All of them had the Moderna vaccine, and all of them were able to create the effect (only on the arm where the vaccine was administered). For all those claiming this is just plain dumb or misinformation, believe what you want. The intent of sharing this was simply to say we don’t know everything about how this new type of vaccine interacts with the body. 

Also i was banned for sharing my experience with the quarters. It’s upsetting, i simply wanted to get insight and share my findings with the community to hear what you guys had to say. Its always scary when people start silencing you for something as small as this. What is the problem with sharing my thoughts? #frustrated",1621510364.0,2021-05-20 04:32:44

This might not seem like a huge deal but my husband and I are trying for a little one so it’s hard not to notice and worry. I would love to hear other’s experiences if you’re willing to share.

I feel cheated.,10,ngsoww,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/ngsoww/i_feel_cheated/,23,"I got my second dose today. Yay, fully vaccinated, right?

Wrong. Apparently the nurse who gave my first dose wrote down Pfizer, but the lot number under it is Moderna. I even asked the woman who gave my my shot today if she was sure.my first dose was Pfizer, since they scheduled my second one for 4 weeks later. She assured me that it was Pfizer.

After I left I looked at my card and noticed the lot numbers for the first and second looked vastly different. So, I looked them up. First is Moderna, second is Pfizer.

As a person with severe anxiety this is a nightmare. I don't get to finally feel relief for being fully vaccinated because there hasn't been testing to prove that mixing them gives results.

As the title states, I feel cheated.

"23F, positive Moderna experience (: (Canada)",8,ngs9nv,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/ngs9nv/23f_positive_moderna_experience_canada/,1,"Hello!

I've had a huge phobia of needles since childhood, so while I was desperately hoping for a vaccine, I was also dreading one. For me, the fear is only sort of associated with the pain - the idea of the needle going into the muscle just gives me the heebie jeebies, to put it lightly. I wanted to share my good experience in case anyone ese is in a similar position to me and contemplating getting the shot! 

I got my first dose of Moderna on May 13th. I know I'm prone to fainting so I had a full meal beforehand w/ a glass of orange juice to keep my sugar up. I got my brother to drive me to the appointment so that I wouldn't be distracted by my anxiety while driving or worry about getting lost. When I met my nurses, I told them that I was very fearful but excited to get my shot and that I was just going to look away, because not seeing the needle would really help me. They were super nice and encouraging the whole time! 

I looked away while the first nurse was giving the questionnaire beforehand (i.e. ""are you allergic to PEG?"" ""have you had any other vaccines in the last 14 days?"" ect.) so I wouldn't see the needle being prepared. I felt the other nurse pinch the skin on my arm and a pretty sharp poke - I was doing my best to make my arm a limp noodle, but tensed up at the last second when I felt her touch my skin. I think tensing up made it hurt, not the needle itself. Regardless, the pain was very manageable and was over in 0.5 seconds.  I immediately said, ""Wow, that wasn't so bad!"" before getting SUPER dizzy. My vision got a little dark and I leaned forward in my chair to rest my head on my knees. I don't believe this is a COVID vaccine reaction - last time I got a freezing shot at the dentist, I fainted in the chair. Still, the nurses were super quick to respond and they brought me a cot to lay on, as well as a cold compress and some apple juice. Within 5 minutes, I felt just like myself again and waited out the rest of the observation period comfortably sitting up and rubbing my arm a bit.

The injection site stung for about 30 minutes after, but again was very manageable. My arm progressively got more sore through the day, and I also had 3 long naps (pretty much sleeping all day). This was definitely a combination of relief and vaccine immune response. Moving my arm helped a lot and made it feel better, and I ended up sleeping with an ice pack wrapped in a cloth by my arm to help soothe any soreness. In retrospect, my arm pain ""peaked"" about 12 hours after the shot. During the night, I had a few hot flashes, but each time I checked my temperature I never actually had a fever.

Day 2 - My arm was just as sore as it was when I went to bed the night before, and I felt sort of tired. I took it easy that day and did some light stretching that made me feel a lot better. 

Day 3 - Arm soreness decreased. I felt a bit lethargic but otherwise fine. 

Day 4 - My arm only hurt when I moved it a certain way by day 4. I kept it moving and by the end of the day, the pain was pretty much gone. 

Day 5 - No side effects! 

It's May 19th now and I'm still feeling great! Not looking forward to the supposedly weird period that comes after the vaccine elicits such a strong immune response, but I still think it's worth it. Wish me luck for shot 2!",1621518865.0,2021-05-20 06:54:25

I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and a lot of health anxiety. I've been watching my blood pressure and stuff, and it's been mostly fine through the whole experience. After the first shot, I had a sore spot on my arm and no other side effects.

**0 - 9 hours:** Nothing at all. My arm hurts a little, but not a big deal. Heart rate is slightly higher than my normal, around 75 compared to 65. I cooked and cleaned no problem, was able to go about my day.

**9-12 hours:** I'm a little achy, and I have a fever that fluctuates between 99.3 and 100.6 F whenever. Overall, not too bad. Heart rate is still around 75.

**12-20 hours:** My legs ache so badly. I can barely walk, I'm weak, I'm exhausted, and my fever hovering around 100.6F. My arm feels like I took a punch from someone who wasn't holding back. It's fairly swollen and a little red. I want to sleep, but I'm having trouble getting comfortable. Anxiety is present, but not overwhelming. Heart rate is elevated further to 80-85.

**20-48 hours:** I'm fatigued, and I'm experiencing bouts of frequent urination and the urge to defecate. The body aches are gone, but the fever is still present. Towards the end of this time period, my fever starts to go away, and I experience sweating and stomache issues, with a fever that comes and goes every hour or two. I sleep a decent amount, and I'm able to eat just fine. Heart rate is still 75-85.

**48-58 hours:** Aches are gone, fatigue is mostly gone, but nausea and diarrhea persist. My fever is usually gone, but occasionally (and quite frustratingly) it comes back. I'm able to eat food, but I feel terrible for an hour afterwards. I thought I was going to faint, but it was just an anxiety attack. Anxiety is in full swing. Not that unusual for me, I have anxiety problems. Heart rate is back to 70-80.

**58-60+ hours:** I'm doing much better. Nausea seems to have subsided, and I'm just a little foggy in the brain. Anxiety is mostly gone, and I'm feeling more or less normal, just a little tired. Here's to hoping we're done. Heart rate is currently 65.",1621500484.0,2021-05-20 01:48:04

Help?!

Hello everyone, hope all well.

I am a 19 year old male. 

I am extremly worried that I still could have covid, and confused about how I have been feeling for the past week and a half. Could this be vaccine side effects, could someone calm me down?

I got my first dose of Pfizer on May 6, I reach my two week mark tomorrow. Since May 10, I have been experiencing very bad muscle and body aches throughout my body, accompanied by a runny nose and congestion. The aches are in my right knee, my elbows and forearms, shoulders, and wrists and hands occasionally, with chest pain. All these paints are very intermittent and don’t last long whatsoever a minute at most. I don’t really know what covid body aches are supposed to feel like, I have health anxiety. I have had this runny nose on and off for this time period as well, and I do sleep with a fan on at home. I have been feeling this wave of nausea after I eat sometimes, but I have yet to throw up from it. 

My appetite has stayed the same, my temp has never surpassed 98.6 Celsius oral, I have no cough other then when I smoke weed but I do notice a tickle in my throat but I never cough from it. For the past two days however I have been having very strong tiredness, the temperature has increased where I live a lot, so I do fine myself tossing and turning at night, but when I have woken up I have felt so exhausted I could go back to sleep. This has been only the past two days tho, and I know I wasn’t able to sleep well these past two nights that quickly. I went to get a PCR test on May 16 since I was so concerned I have the virus and I felt like I waited long enough to get it done from the onset of these muscle aches, I tested negative. My anxiety has been through the roof, I feel very slow and that something feels off and I’m convinced it’s covid. I got a rapid antigen test done today, to try and calm myself down, I tested negative again, and I still can not relax. I am so freaked out that I still could have covid, could this be the vaccine or am I just extremely paranoid?

Thanks in advance!",1621522044.0,2021-05-20 07:47:24

1st Pfizer Dose,5,ngjhdr,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/ngjhdr/1st_pfizer_dose/,2,"I felt minor nausea in the car on the way home, 20 minutes after my 1st Pfizer dose. The day after, my arm was slightly sore but not painful. I also had a mild to moderate bout of depression, but I figured out it's because I was 'hangry' and hadn't eaten much. I fueled my body to help my immune system and made sure to get a good night's sleep. Day 2: I woke up well-rested, and noticed no symptoms apart from residual arm soreness. Day 3: full recovery 🙂

Given what others have reported concerning vaccine symptoms, I suspect I may have been exposed to the coronavirus beforehand. I was very sick a few months ago, experienced chills, headache, fever, intense shivering and urge to throw up. I tested negative for the virus when I went in to a testing center a few weeks later. So either I was already exposed to the virus, or I must have an amazing immune system. But it's more likely to be the former.

**TLDR:** positive experience from Pfizer vaccine, minor muscle soreness, no major issues.",1621492939.0,2021-05-19 23:42:19

Vaccinated Earlier Today,4,ngdmaz,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/ngdmaz/vaccinated_earlier_today/,6,"**2:45 local time**, shot received at approx 10:30.

I was just browsing this sub out of curiosity, and thought I would contribute. I’m a 26 year old male, 6ft1, 177 pounds (give or take). 

4 hours post shot, I have had very minimal side effects. I have the faintest headache, a little bit of brain fog, and very mild soreness at the injection site. I feel well enough that I’m going to take the dog for a walk, because it is a beautiful day where I am! 

I will continue to update this post for the rest of the day, and possibly beyond depending on if I develop more side effects.

**5:50**

Over 7 hours after the shot, and I still feel fine. I’m currently sipping on a nice bourbon that I set aside for this occasion. The most immediate side effect I feel is brain fog, but it’s manageable. My arm has gotten slightly more sore since my initial post, but I would still classify it as mild tenderness. Still a very slight headache as well. 

**10:10**

Coming up on 12 hours after first shot. My headache has been gone for a couple of hours, but my arm has gotten more stiff/sore. I’ve been scatterbrained/forgetful all day, so I suppose the brain fog is still there, although I feel pretty normal. After half a day, my side effects have been next to nil.

**9:30 am (next day)**

Only a bit of residual arm soreness, but otherwise I feel normal.

32 Male - Moderna 2nd Shot,5,ng9kai,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/ng9kai/32_male_moderna_2nd_shot/,1,"I received my 2nd Moderna shot 2 days ago, and this is my experience.

Firstly, I had no side effects after my first shot, besides some very minor soreness on my shoulder.

Wish I could say the same for my second. As soon as I received my 2nd shot, I could already tell something about this was different than the first. I immediately felt slightly light headed, but nothing significant enough to impair me from driving back home. Kinda similar to being slightly high to be honest...

Rest of my day went fine. It's only once I woke up the following morning did I start to feel the real side effects. Fever, chills, headaches, body soreness, and headaches. I suppose this is somewhat normal for any vaccine, but this one did knock me out pretty badly. I was bed ridden for most of the day, and thankfully have a nurse wife who looked after me.

It's now 2 days in, and I'm completely fine. The side effects really just lasted for the following day, and I'm 100% back to my normal self now.

**Advice for those getting your 2nd Moderna Shot:**

\- Take the next day off. Take a day off work, and try to have a completely empty schedule. Trust me you're not going to be in any shape to do anything that requires mental of physical ability.

\- Once the fever hits, try to keep your body temperature low. I'm not medically inclined myself, so as soon as the chills hit, I did everything to warm up, which according to my nurse wife is the opposite of what you should be doing, and could actually lead to a more severe fever. It's not easy, but it's important to try and lower your body temperature and fight off the fever, and not bundle on clothes and blankets etc.

\- Hydration is key. Make sure you have loads of water, and also electrolyte heavy drinks like Gatorade, or in my case, coconut water. You will sweat loads during this time especially as your body is fighting off the fever, so making sure you're staying hydrated will be key to getting back to normal asap.

\- Have Tylenol or Advil ready to go. I'm not usually one to take medication, but I do feel this time it helped me recover and reduce the extent of the side effects I was undergoing.",1621468638.0,2021-05-19 16:57:18

-I've safely sustained basically the same lifestyle throughout covid and neither me or anybody I know has gotten the virus. 

-Some of the stories online and in this sub really scare me. There are people who are very gung ho about the vaccine saying they regret it and that they're really worried about long term effects. There are symptoms described on this sub that I don't see being reported in more mainstream sources. It just seems sketchy to me sometimes.


I do want to get vaccinated, but I'm honestly pretty fearful of potential side effects. I'd feel a lot more comfortable getting it somewhere down the road when more information is available.
