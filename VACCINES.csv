How I Overcame My Vaccine Hesitancy,15,nox3db,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/nox3db/how_i_overcame_my_vaccine_hesitancy/,3,"A year ago, I was very disinclined to take a covid-19 vaccine should one become available. Now, I've had my first dose and I'm planning to get my second.

In this post, I describe how my thinking shifted over the past year. I write this in the hope that it may be useful to other hesitant people, and maybe even to policymakers and communicators.


## About Me

I'm a young person living in Ontario, Canada, though I think the points in this post are broadly applicable, especially to young people.


## Part 1: The Hesitancy

I hold one group of people responsible for my hesitancy, and another for helping me overcome it.

I'll call the first group the ""establishment"". I'm including in it the political establishment (political leaders of most jurisdictions, including mine), the public health establishment (public health authorities of most jurisdictions, including mine), and the media establishment (the majority, though by no means all, of the commentators and experts who appear in mainstream media sources).

In other words, the people who determine the policy responses to the pandemic, and to a large extent the narratives and messaging around it in public discourse.

I've found the prevailing messaging about the pandemic to be very one-sided: all about the risks and dangers of covid-19, and fairly little about the risks and effects of the interventions taken against it.

As a young person, my risk of serious illness or death from covid-19 is very low. Yet, I've been asked to deprive myself of almost all in-person social contact, for (most of) what is now a period of 14 months and counting. Many young people have had their educations interrupted, or replaced with inferior online options. Many others lost their jobs and faced evictions and economic precarity.

And compounding all this was the moralizing attitude that pervaded the establishment narratives. Not only were we asked to cut out in-person social contact, we were asked as if that were _no big deal_. When we failed to completely suppress our fundamental human need for being with other people, we were called ""grandma killers"", or ""the people responsible for dragging this on"".

In some circles, if you didn't signal your virtue by emphasizing that every interaction you've had with another person has been virtual, and that you don't even go to the grocery store but get your groceries delivered (never mind that it's a _person_ who has to deliver it to you, doing the rounds in two hundred condo building corridors over the course of her day), you were considered part of the problem.

""Two weeks to flatten the curve"", they told us. But the message didn't change from the first two weeks, to the twentieth two weeks.

I didn't feel like what the establishment was asking of me was reasonable and proportionate, and I didn't feel like it was in my best interests.

I _resented_ being asked to make these sacrifices for the benefit of society, and as a result felt resentment and mistrust towards the establishment.

(Perhaps you, the reader, judge me for that. Perhaps you think I'm selfish and should instead meet society's needs with humility and grace rather than resentment. Maybe you're right. But that doesn't change the reality that there are people who think and feel as I do -- perhaps more than you might think -- and getting through to such people requires a change in approach, a change in messaging.)

What does this have to do with vaccine hesitancy? Simply that it was the same establishment -- that I distrusted and resented -- that was now asking me to get vaccinated.

If I felt that _one thing_ the establishment was asking of me (subjecting myself to strict lockdown measures) was not in my best interests, why would I trust that _another thing_ they were asking of me (getting vaccinated) was?


## Part 2: The Overcoming

Being so disillusioned with mainstream narratives, and feeling like the establishment was not a place for me to look to for sympathy or understanding, I started to look elsewhere.

I found the sympathy and understanding I was looking for from a group of people I started to follow on Twitter. Some of them were doctors (some even epidemiologists), others were lay commentators.

This group of people had a somewhat different perspective on the pandemic. They recognized that the pandemic and the responses to it created a _variety_ of challenges for people: the risk of illness and death from covid-19, but also social isolation, economic hardship, and many others. They showed _empathy_ to people facing any of these challenges.

To borrow a memorable turn of phrase employed by one member of this group, they did not subscribe to the [monomania](https://twitter.com/bergerbell/status/1362527692571119618) that afflicted the establishment, whereby all aspects of how we organize our society revolve around one consideration -- the risk of covid-19 -- to the exclusion of all others.

I want to be very clear: these people were **not** covid denialists or conspiracy theorists of any sort. The doctors among them were respected experts at major universities. They did not dispute the scientific consensus about questions like how covid-19 is transmitted or what its fatality rate is or whether PCR tests work. They just held a minority view about the **policy** aspects of our pandemic response, such as whether extended strict lockdowns were a proportionate intervention, or whether the benefits of school closures outweighed their harms to children.

These folks advocated for a _harm reduction_ approach to covid safety, rather than an _abstinence-only_ approach. They recognized that human beings have needs, and over a period of multiple months, some people _are_ going to meet up from time to time. They never once passed judgment or engaged in moralizing. They gave us the best scientific information available about the risks of various activities -- explaining, for example, how much safer the outdoors was than the indoors, and why -- and left it to us to use that information to make reasoned decisions about our behaviour. They treated us like the human beings possessing agency and autonomy that we are.

In these people, I found something I lacked when listening only to establishment voices. I found a perspective that didn't make me want to tear my hair out. I found values that I could identify with. I found guidance that I felt I could trust.

And now, we come to the crucial part: **this group, too, was enthusiastically pro-vaccine**.

The same message -- ""get vaccinated"" -- that meant next to nothing coming from the group I resented (the establishment), became trustworthy and valuable advice coming from this group of people I've come to trust.

Rather than sternly warning us that even after vaccination, we'd have to continue to socially distance until some nebulous unspecified time in the future -- which was the main message we heard from the establishment -- this group reassured us that vaccination is our way out of this pandemic, and that it was safe for vaccinated groups of people to do pretty much anything they could do pre-pandemic.

(They also advocated for recognition of this fact by establishment institutions, and were in some cases successful. When, on May 13 2021, the U.S. CDC finally announced that vaccinated people did not, in fact, have to socially distance from each other, that was in part thanks to the efforts of some members of this group to raise awareness about the accumulating evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines at stopping transmission.)

When we had concerns about vaccine side effects, people in this group were generous in taking the time to share their expertise, point us to the latest available accurate information, and help allay our concerns. When reports of rare but serious side effects emerged, such as about the AstraZeneca vaccine causing rare blood clots (""VITT""), they didn't lecture us about how the risk of covid was surely higher. Rather, they recognized that VITT was indeed a scary outcome, and that if we felt more comfortable waiting a few weeks for an mRNA vaccine, that was a perfectly understandable personal choice. (Establishment guidance caught up here too, with AstraZeneca being discontinued for first doses just a few weeks later.)

This group of people helped me get over the fence, from being wholly uncertain that getting a covid-19 vaccine would be in my best interests, to being quite convinced that it was.

I won't list everyone I consider to be in this group, but I'll call out one person who stands out: [Dr. Monica Gandhi](https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9), an infectious diseases doctor at UCSF. I have nothing but admiration and deep gratitude for her. If you want to be part of an online community engaging in empathetic, optimistic, and empowering pandemic discourse, start by following her.


## Part 3: The Takeaways

Here's my theory for how most people who get entrenched in vaccine hesitancy come to hold their beliefs:

  1. Like me (and maybe for similar reasons), they feel disillusioned by the establishment.
  2. Like me, they search for other communities and sources of guidance and advice.
  3. Rather than encountering the group of people that I did, they encounter a different group -- people who are not only skeptical of the policy responses to the pandemic, but who also question the scientific consensus, and allege conspiracies and cover-ups at various institutional levels.
  4. They come to trust this group, because the narratives they offer are more comforting than the ones on offer from the establishment.
  5. This group advises them to be skeptical of and reject vaccines (I guess because that fits well with their conspiracy theorizing).

Most current efforts to combat vaccine hesitancy seem to focus on intervening at step (3) of this process -- banning the misinformation purveyors from social media, that sort of thing. We can debate how effective that is likely to be. (I'm personally skeptical that ramping up on censorship would foster trust in the establishment, but that's a topic for another time.)

But what if we intervened at step (1) instead? What if our establishment institutions engaged in the sort of messaging that fosters trust, so people didn't _feel the need_ to look elsehwere in the first place?

I'm not suggesting that authorities simply tell people what they want to hear. (I recognize the dangers of that, as e.g. when some scientists mistakenly claimed early in the pandemic that we were already close to herd immunity. We may have really wanted to believe that, but it wasn't the case.) Accurate, evidence-based information is key.

But there _is_ room to craft guidance and frame discourse in a more balanced, less one-sided way. To replace the shaming and the moralizing with universal compassion and empathy, towards the effects of disease _and_ the effects of interventions. To recognize that after 14 months of isolation, there is a limit to what you can reasonably expect from people, and what tradeoffs people are willing to make for public health. To acknowledge that people desperately need an endgame to this pandemic, to message such an endgame, and to make clear the vital role vaccines play in it.

A few subtle but important changes to our approach could go a long way towards putting a dent in vaccine hesitancy.",1622472841.0,2021-05-31 07:54:01

I trust the science that the vaccine is effective and overall well tolerated. I just have some hesitancy due to my doctor and side effects from loved ones. Help me feel better about taking it.,13,nnqo4y,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/nnqo4y/i_trust_the_science_that_the_vaccine_is_effective/,12,"I was scheduled to take the vaccine, but ended up cancelling. I know it has saved many lives already and the benefit far outweighs the risk for the population. I am not anti vax at all, and fully vaccinated otherwise. 

I saw my doctor for a physical, and asked for his opinion. He told me to wait. He is concerned because I am a young male, and warned me that young males are the highest risk of myocarditis from the vaccine. He wants to wait for more data on myocarditis risk. I see the CDC still recommends the vaccine for young males despite the myocarditis risk, because the known benefit of preventing COVID-19 outweighs the possible heart issue risk the CDC is still investigating. 

I looked up myocarditis after my appointment. It just worries me to see stories of teenagers and 20 year olds having heart issues less than 4 days after taking the vaccine. It looks to be very rare, but now I am worried. It is far more common than the J&J blood clots. King County, Washington alone had 14 confirmed cases in young people less than 4 days after vaccination. 

What really makes me worry is my dad had a heart attack the week of his second Moderna dose. He was admitted to ICU with myocarditis. We didn’t even think it was related to the vaccine at the time, but after the myocarditis issue was pointed out to me I am worried maybe that was related. 

Should I reschedule and take it now? Is it safe to wait a few more weeks to see what the CDC finds on myocarditis in young people?",1622333554.0,2021-05-29 17:12:34

I understand that all the data we currently have shows that the vaccines are safe and effective. Now, I'm typically a very paranoid person, so naturally I've been down the rabbit hole researching adverse reactions to the various covid vaccines. I'm wondering what the odds are of having a life threatening adverse reaction? Are there any specific underlying conditions that could lead to severe adverse reactions? I guess I just need someone to tell me I'm going to be okay lol. My whole family, my girlfriend, and her whole family have had Moderna and they've told me it's like catching a cold for a day or two.

My parents are completing pro-vaccines and have been pushing me to get vaccinated long before April, but I cannot get myself to get vaccinated.  Every time I think of getting a vaccine, my head aches, chest hurts, and blood pressure sky rockets because of my anxiety.  I have been making excuses which got me out of getting vaccinated for almost two months now, but my parents are on me now about it like never before.  I need help badly; I cannot for the love of God sit there and get vaccinated because I cannot do needles—saying I am terrified would be an understatement to what I am currently feeling.  Plus, the fact that none of the vaccines have been approved by the FDA also signals a small alarm too, but mainly my anxiety is the problem.

I hesitate with using any, cause if one gets approved and other doesn't.. I can't get re-vaccinated xD
I suppose Sputnik won't be approved due to political reasons (or maybe not only).. and about Sinopharm I'm really confused. I read that Sinopharm was approved by WHO for emergency use.. but was it exactly ""Hayat Vax"" or it means every vaccine they produce is approved by WHO?
If it's actually approved by WHO does it mean that it's good to go with, and it will let me enter EU?

Getting coronavirus vaccine twice (2 vaccine types)?,3,nh4bth,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/nh4bth/getting_coronavirus_vaccine_twice_2_vaccine_types/,10,"Hi everyone! Let me first say that YES I am pursuing this for actual, medical advisement with both my doctor and the study team. That said, while I await a response, I can't find a ton of anecdotal chatter about this online so I thought I'd throw it out here.

I'm currently fully vaccinated with NovaVax (a spike protein vaccine), but as I await FDA approval, I have had unavoidable travel suddenly arise where they are requiring vaccination proof and my NovaVax card won't be accepted without FDA EUA. As far as I can tell, that could be tomorrow or 1-3 months from now.

So I'm now considering getting either the J&J or Pfizer vaccine (only ones I can fit in my time constraint) - I don't really see why that would be an issue in theory given that they're different types of vaccinations from the NovaVax, and it may even provide more diverse immunity, but has anybody heard why this might be inadvisable i.e. unsafe? I don't mind if I can expect to feel rotten. :)

I am having Pfizer one. I know I should “man up” but my stupid anxiety is ruling me completely right now. 

For me personally I feel I could cope with anything such as headaches, muscle pain, tiredness etc, all except from a fever/chills, getting a fever is what is worrying me the most, it’s hard to explain why but I just have a fear of fevers :/

But it is what it is, it definitely has to be done and I will get it done, can I please ask exactly how a fever feels? I haven’t been sick for literally 10+ years and only have a brief memory of how it felt to have a fever.

Sorry, I must come off as so ridiculous, but I genuinely am scared lol! 

I just keep telling myself that by being vaccinated there are so many benefits, I will be potentially stopping spreading actual virus to other people and if I ever was to get the actual virus, well I have some protection against it, but in all honesty I am getting it done so I have “done my part”, so I don’t go spreading it to other people, I haven’t actually caught Covid since it all began, I have been SO LUCKY! I haven’t been going out and mixing with anyone since it started but obviously have had to go out when essential such as for shopping, but somehow I have never caught it.

We're talking, one time I went to get blood taken from my finger, it's a tiny pin-prick you can barely feel, and I nearly passed out and vomited afterwards. It's  100% psychological, I know. Other needles don't scare me, I mean, I have a tattoo and that's hundreds of needles stabbing you.

But I want to get vaccinated. J&J is just one shot so I signed up but. I'm so scared.

I want to know how long it takes for the shot from the moment the needle stabs you. Is it only a few seconds? Or is it more, like 5+ seconds? I feel like I may be able to hold on for like 4-5 seconds max with only tears (lol) but aftet that it's either panic attack and/or passing out. (I'm speaking from experience, I am DEATHLY terrified, I start feeling ill even just seeing medical needles on TV).

I don't care if it actually hurts, as long as the needle is away from me as fast as possible.

Also, is there a possibility you may need to get pricked twice? I know some horror stories of people getting blood drawn and yeah I'm gonna stab details here cuz I'm feeling sick again. You know what I'm talking about probably.

Also, it's in the shoulder right? Not in the forearm (extra scary to me for some reason)

Also #2, is numbing topical cream allowed? Or can it mess with the vaccine?

I survived one pregnancy during Covid but because everything was shut and we were very shielded it’s a little different now to everything opening back up again and I’m getting increasingly anxious.

Everything is saying there aren’t any adverse effects on pregnant women receiving the vaccine.... but... I’ve been reading on the CDC website that women who are vaccinated can take part in a moderation program where they are encouraged to document their progress during the pregnancy via the V-Safe Pregnancy registry. I was thrown off by this statement 

          ‘ Specific health effects that scientists will be looking at include:

Pregnancy outcomes, like miscarriage and stillbirth
Pregnancy complications, like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes
Problems with the newborn, like preterm delivery, poor growth, or birth defects’ 

Link- https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html

The reason I’m thrown off, is because I’ve heard some conspiracy theories about the vaccine causing complication such a stillbirths and other things listed as areas of interest. And obviously this has really confused me. 

Why can’t they just be honest and say that they aren’t sure whether it can have these effects rather than saying they definitely can’t? When they are actually clearly unsure?

The title is pretty self-explanatory and I kindly ask that anyone responding please refrain from saying something along the lines of ""its no big deal"" or ""its not so bad"". I've lost track of how many times I've heard that and believe me, I wish it was the case with me.

I'm in my 30s and have held out on getting the covid vaccine due to my needle anxiety. I'm healthy and would be at the very end of any priority list to begin with. One of the silver linings I try to tell myself is that my needle anxiety means there is one more vaccine for someone whose life may very well depend on it.

I've had needle anxiety ever since I was a toddler. For whatever reason, a couple of immunizations I received back then were very painful for me and resulted in me crying in horror and pain. Since then, during pediatric visits, I would tremble and sob when the nurse came in with the shots. Thankfully, I overcame that part but the nurse always had to get me to relax, look away, and take a deep breath. And usually, the clinic I went to was understanding of my situation.

But since I can no longer see my pediatrician, I only go to the doctor or get a shot if its an absolute must. I have a belief that I won't be afforded that level of understanding or compassion I had at the pediatric clinic. I believe it would be even worse at vaccination sites because companies and people probably aren't too happy about having their hours diverted to giving something away.

Aside from covid, I'm not oblivious to the fact that I can't go forever without vaccines, especially as I get older. If there are any doctors, nurses, or pharmacists who deal with patients with needle anxiety on a semi-regular basis, it would be nice to hear from you. Thank you.",1621071423.0,2021-05-15 02:37:03

Advice on how to explain that the COVID vaccine is safe and faking a vaccination card is unethical.,14,n9ci5y,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/n9ci5y/advice_on_how_to_explain_that_the_covid_vaccine/,14,"I was having a conversation with someone yesterday and they mentioned faking a vaccination card to be able to travel. I asked them why not just get the vaccine? They didn’t like the idea of “following the herd” and claimed that their diet provided enough immunity against the virus. Although I personally believe in getting vaccinated for certain diseases / infections such as measles and polio and am lenient on not getting a yearly flu vaccination, I struggled to explain to them that the vaccine for COVID is safe and that faking a vaccination card is highly unethical ESPECIALLY if they don’t wear a mask where it is not required. The area that we live in is right next to a county with one of the highest case rates in the country. I was hoping to come here to gather resources and information on how to explain to someone (who doesn’t believe in getting the vaccine) how the Pfizer vaccine works, why it’s safe, what it does to the body, why faking a vaccination card is unethical and any other comments that you might have that could help create an understanding for them.

Long-term effects of vaccines?,10,n8y42d,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/n8y42d/longterm_effects_of_vaccines/,10,"One of the frequent objections to getting the covid-19 vaccines is that ""we don't know what the long-term effects are."" I don't really have any answer for that beyond saying we've had over a year now of data that seems to show they are safe. But then the skeptic will push back and say who knows what will be the effects 2, 3 or 5 years down the line. 

Is there any precedent for a vaccine that had bad long-term effects that weren't obvious within the first year? If I had to guess I'd imagine that the longer the time since the vaccine was administered, the likelihood of a bad long-term effect drops off sharply. But I don't have any proof of this I can cite. That's just a hunch.

Can anyone provide me with some information about possible interactions (or recommendatios in general) of mRNA vaccine and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride)? I'm trying to find something about this topic for the last three days, but can't find anything.

I'm asking this because I was scheduled to get Moderna vaccine on 5th of May. When I told the physician that I take finasteride (1 mg/day for 7 years now) she told me that I cannot get the jab. The reason that she gave was that she checked on the Internet (sic!) That finasteride is a steroid and these drugs tend to supposedly weaken the production of antibodies. If I want the vaccine I should stop taking the drug for at least 15 days before the first dose.

I'm not sure if I'm right but is it possible that she didn't understand what finasteride accutaly is and  what purpose it serves/ what is its mode of action? I know steroids for their antiinflammatory action but I not sure if 5-alpha reductase inhibitors work the same way?

Unusual Nerve Pain/Numbness after Dose 1 of Pfizer,5,n47opi,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/n47opi/unusual_nerve_painnumbness_after_dose_1_of_pfizer/,6,"Hey everyone, I'm not sure where to start here - I've been googling like crazy for the past month or so, but I'm really not finding anything, so I might try here if anyone's had any similar issues or have read something about it.

**Quick disclaimer in case anyone reads this has vaccine anxiety: Still get yours. I still 100% advocate vaccines, and millions and millions have perfectly normal reactions to the shot.**  
I got got Pfizer dose 1 exactly a week ago today, first day everything normal. Sore arm, had chills for like maybe 30 mins, felt fine and went to bed. Next day (about 24 hours later) I had some numbness in my injection arm finger. Then the top of my hand, arm, and then eventually both arms and legs.

This was major alarm bells for me because my mom who got her 2nd dose about 2 and a half months ago seems to have ended up with some form of neuropathy. Tingling, numbness in fingers and feet, as well as ""burning tongue syndrome"" symptoms. She's been to various doctors now, and honestly nobody really has an answer. They've been rotating different pills, nothing really seems to make a huge difference, and has further appointments scheduled.

At this point I'm obviously very concerned with getting a 2nd dose (don't get me wrong I want to get it, I'm not trying to make excuses to not get it). However, I'm very concerned that I may have an even worse reaction, and feel like it may be wise to stop right here - potentially avoiding permanent nerve damage.

For me, taking things like Advil and Aleve do seem to help which leads me to believe that I have inflammation putting pressure on my nerves, creating the numbness and aches - almost like I have a sunburn. The best that I can assume is that both my mom and I have something genetic which had us both present very similar issues to the vaccine. (As a side note, she had a flu shot years ago and had a perfectly normal reaction to that).

The reason why I am asking is that I live at home with my parents who are anti-vax. I plan getting the vaccine behind their backs. I am worried my parents will confuse the side effects for COVID-19 and panic. If they figure out that I got vaccinated, I'll just have to deal with the consequences. Part of my plan to get vaccinated is to mask/lie/cover-up the side effects and any evidence of a vaccine as much as possible. My plan so far is to have tylenol and/or ibuprofen on hand for the side effects.

Looking for good/positive/successful information on vaccines in general.,5,n0knlk,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/n0knlk/looking_for_goodpositivesuccessful_information_on/,6,"My mom was always skeptical when it comes to medicine in general. I.e. We never took antibiotics as kids, only got the mandatory vaccines etc. she’s always had tendencies towards natural remedies, good „mental health Leads to good physical (?) health“ etc.
Now with the lockdown I think she’s spending too much time on certain social media groups and she’s on her way to turning into an full blown conspiracy theorist.

She’s doesn’t want to wear a mask, because she read that it doesn’t really protect you against COVID ( duh nothing 100% protects you from it except maybe a hazmat suit). This combined with our government pushing the mandatory mask thing (even outside), despite them not being really effective, I guess started the whole thing in her head.
She doesn’t want to get tested because she doesn’t want to support the companies who make the tests. ( because „they probably don’t really work and it’s just for profits.“)
And of course she doesn’t want to get vaccinated because the vaccines don’t even work and it’s just a money machine, backed by all of the governments, huge campaigns, „they are using us as labrats“, „the vaccine Alters your rna and can make you infertile“ etc. 
She even got a document from her doctor saying that she can’t wear masks for medical reasons. I don’t even know if she can work without a mask (she a midwife working in a hospital) and to be fair, there are some really fucked up things that happen in hospitals especially when it comes to newborns and the hospitals being run like companies that have to profitable etc. This only makes her more suspicious.

I obviously understand where she’s coming from and feel like a certain amount of skepticism is a good thing. But this goes to far. It’s gotten out of hand!
I now feel like a have to do an intervention.
I know most of the things I listed are ridiculous claims but I don’t have the knowledge to debunk them.
I already know she’s going to say: what has big Pharma ever done to actually help humanity? (Referring to it all being for profits and not actually healing people but making them dependent on taking meds their entire life) and more importantly: what have vaccines ever done good? (More of the things she says are in the text above)

Im hoping some of you may already have like a collection of credible papers on successful vaccines and maybe general information to counter some of the classic anti-vaxxers claims? Any links to good threads are also very much appreciated.

TLDR: help, my moms an anti-vaxxer!

Edit: I’m already pretty good on debunking most of her sources since I’m kinda into conspiracy theories (for my amusement of course) so I notice manipulative schemes, them using other conspiracies to play into their narrative etc. I just need some facts to back my claims. And please no „dude forget it she’s a lost cause“ comments.

And sorry for the chaotic text I’m not a native and this is an emotional topic for me.

2nd edit: I might have been a little overexcited when I saw this subreddit and maybe should have read all of the posts already made in here. I understand that but would still appreciate any information.",1619661312.0,2021-04-28 18:55:12
Are some Covid vaccines more painful than others?,4,n0isea,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/n0isea/are_some_covid_vaccines_more_painful_than_others/,7,"Just curious.

I am afraid of needles and try to avoid them at all costs. I got my 1st Covid vaccine (Pfizer) on 4/15, and while I found it slightly painful, it wasn't any different than how I remember vaccines as a child. My arm was sore for a day or two afterwards, but I had no other side effects.

My husband is not afraid of needles and has had many regular vaccines, flu vaccines, blood draws, blood donations, etc. over the years. He got his Covid vaccine (J&J) today, and he said it was awful. His exact words ""OMG that hurts. Feels like I got stabbed with a knitting needle. It's like electrical pulses. This freaking sucks."" and then a couple of minutes later... ""Its cramping up. The needle was the best part"". He also claimed that it was way worse than all of the other needles he has ever dealt with in his life.

Anyways, is the J&J vaccine supposed to be more painful than the others?

My husband didn't actually want to get the vaccine, so I am wondering if he is purposely overreacting to it. Lol",1619656301.0,2021-04-28 17:31:41

Need advice: roommate’s parents convincing her to not get vaccine,7,mzadwy,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/mzadwy/need_advice_roommates_parents_convincing_her_to/,6,"Hi! New to this community but wanted to get some advice.

My roommate (21) won’t get vaccinated because her parents don’t want her to and are basically manipulating/guilting her into not getting the vaccine. Last month, when I told my roommate’s mom I was getting vaccinated soon, her mom made a few snarky comments. After the call ended, I asked my roommate why her mom had reacted that way. She told me it was because it was a “very personal issue” to her mom because essentially she knew a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy who dropped dead after getting the vaccine. I just ignored this story  because I didn’t believe it for a second, but I realized that my roommate did.

After a few weeks, m most of our friends had gotten vaccinated (myself included), and it seemed like my roommate was going to go ahead and get it when it was made available to her. But when I asked last night, she said no, because her parents now had a different reason. 

Essentially, the story is this: my roommate’s grandma had had fertility issues, and 60 years ago, she took some experimental drug for fertility issues that allegedly made her fertility issues worse. My roommate’s mom also had fertility issues (obviously more likely if it’s in your genes), and so my roommate herself is probably prone to fertility issues. And that is why her parents don’t want her to get vaccinated.

I’m just as confused by this logic as anyone, because 1) I have no idea what this has to do with a COVID vaccine, 2) fertility issues are often passed through genetics, and 3) this was some experimental drug 60 years ago at a time where many household products were also causing fertility issues.

I told my roommate I thought that that was a dumb argument, and she told me that she couldn’t go against her parents’ wishes. I said that she could, as she is an adult who can make her own decisions, and she just responded by saying it would be disrespectful towards them.

You have to understand that my roommate has a very codependent relationship with her parents, and they’ve essentially raised her to make every decision with their opinions and values in mind, even as an adult. My roommate is very smart, but I’m just frustrated because she’s clearly so blinded by this manipulation and guilt that her parents are placing on her, and the way they’re prohibiting her from making her own choices, to see that the logic of their argument makes absolutely no sense. I can understand being hesitant to try new medicines and vaccines, but this reasoning is just ridiculous.

A very close friend of ours, who has Crohn’s Disease and other autoimmune issues, has tried to reason with my roommate, explaining to her that she wasn’t able to get many important vaccines growing up because of her health issues. She was thankfully able to get the COVID vaccine, and to her, it’s disrespectful to see completely healthy people close to her refusing to take a simple action that can protect people like her who may not be able to protect themselves. However, my roommate doesn’t seem to care about this reasoning and only cares about what her parents think.

I know that it’s not necessarily my place to point out the parents’ blatant manipulation and control over my roommate, but this is an issue that not only affects my roommate’s health but also that of people around her. As far as I know, no one in her family has gotten or plans to get vaccinated, and God forbid one of them gets it and spreads it to a family member with compromised health.

If you have any advice on how I should approach this, if at all, I would greatly appreciate it!!",1619506465.0,2021-04-26 23:54:25

Questions re: Safety (and My Neuroses),12,mtlo66,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/mtlo66/questions_re_safety_and_my_neuroses/,10,"I'm nervous about the COVID vaccine but I'm surrounded by extremely smart, accomplished people in my life, all of whom have gotten it, and it makes me wonder if maybe I'm just overly sensitive to fear-mongering.

My first question is, how do we know the vaccines don't have detrimental effects down the line later in life, maybe even years later?  For instance, the yellow fever vaccine has been around for 80 years.  If there were complications from it later in life, we'd have seen them by now.  mRNA vaccines are relatively new, and the COVID vaccines are especially new.  How do we know there won't be negative effects on the body in the future?  We don't have anyone who took it decades ago to find out, obviously.

Second, I wondered if anyone could just calm my fears on this.  I feel like I'd rather get COVID naturally than make an active decision that causes health implications for me.  I just would feel so disappointed in myself and so stupid.  I already have several chronic illnesses and I'd hate myself to no end if I made it worse all because I was trying to prevent a virus I have little chance of catching (I'm not high risk anyway, I never leave my house, and I live in a rural area with relatively fewer cases than most areas).  We don't even really know how effective the vaccine is at preventing transmission of COVID to others, so that's not convincing me to get one.  Does anyone else feel like this?

Third, another please-calm-my-fears thing.  I'm very terrified of having side effects and getting really sick after my vaccine(s).  It sounds, honestly, like being poisoned.  That's how it feels in my brain, and it correspondingly freaks me out as much as the idea of poisoning myself does.  Anyone else really stressing out?

I don't want to lie to anyone about having got it, because I respect people's choice to decide whether or not to be around me, an unvaccinated person.  But I don't have any excuse not to get it that doesn't make me sound like a crazy conspiracy theorist.  When all the smart people around you are making one decision and you're making another, it definitely gives you pause to see if maybe you're the one in the wrong, you know?

Pfizer 1st dose experience as someone who with needle phobia and advice to anyone who is like me,5,mqwiva,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/mqwiva/pfizer_1st_dose_experience_as_someone_who_with/,6,"Just wanted to share my experience as someone who was extremely nervous about going through with this. 

I get very bad anxiety with anything medical especially needles. The thought of it makes me nervous even if it has nothing to do with me, seeing them on tv all the time has been traumatic, etc. 

Luckily I only had to stress for about 48 hours but it got progressively worse as the time went on. I took Olly Stress Gummies last night which did relax me and took 2 melatonin right before bed. I did wake up multiple times throughout the night with my heart racing and just overall anxious. 

This am I took two more off the stress gummies as well as 25 mg of Benadryl for the anxiety and I will say this helped significantly. It made me much more relaxed and subdued. I also put numbing cream on both arms. 

I went to a mass vaccination site which moved quickly with minimal waiting so almost no time to get anxious until right before. I will say this situation makes it hard to not see needles/syringes as they are all around. If this is something that you’re extremely sensitive to maybe go to a more private location if possible. 

I received the first dose of Pfizer (side question for anyone reading this who might no are the actual vaccines the same for each dose or are they slightly different). Even with the numbing cream I’m not going to lie it hurt. I felt the needle go in and felt a little stinging (not horrible) and pressure with the medicine. So many people on here and in real life told me they didn’t feel anything at all and it didn’t hurt or they didn’t even know it had happened. That was not my experience. I wish someone had been more honest with me because between the cream and peoples reports I expected it to be less painful than it was. Now was it awful no. Maybe a 3.5 or 4 out of 10 IMO but everyone’s pain tolerance is different. I also haven’t had a vaccine in 12 or 13 years so didn’t have much to compare it too. 

As far as side effects I’m right at 4 hours post shot. My arm has gotten gradually more sore since then but unless I try to lift it higher than shoulder level it’s pretty negligible, higher than that it definitely hurts. I do feel like a slight headache could be coming on but me looking for it. I know some people say they felt tired and off but with what I have taken for anxiety I wouldn’t know if it’s that or the vaccine. The side effects of fever chills sickness etc are something that did and do concern me. 

I haven’t taken Tylenol but I am considering it. 

All in all I survived it and while it was worse than I had hoped it wasn’t terrible. Will I have anxiety next time I’m sure, but I plan on taking the same steps, and hoping maybe the next one is even easier. 

I’m happy to answer any questions anyone has and will update on any other side effects.",1618453052.0,2021-04-14 19:17:32

The one-and-done convenience of J&J is really appealing, and I can get it slightly sooner.  I’ve also had relatives that have been laid out for two days after the second dose of Pfizer.  Because of work and childcare responsibilities, that would be a hardship for me.

However, the lower efficacy of J&J makes me wonder if should go with Pfizer. This is a factor because I have people close to me who are absolutely refusing to get vaccinated, and I’m worried about spread at future family gatherings.  My doctor friend told me that the Pfizer has better technology in terms of producing a booster In response to variants. 

Also, not sure if this matters, but, while I’ve never had an allergic reaction to a vaccine, I do have minor allergies to some antibiotics and a severe food allergy (not egg) resulting in anaphylaxis.  

So, which would you choose in my shoes?

Firstly to add context, my family is all Q-anon and Duck Go Go types, I am not.

I found nothing supporting this idea- which settled it for a while, but then I was sent an article about women who get the vaccine, and how it affects their periods. I looked into it and there are several articles supporting this information. 

This is sketchy to me, and I haven’t found any reason as to why it’s happening. I’m really just looking for any kind of confirmation/information that could comfort or offer more insight to this?

Astrozeneca Vaccine Clotting - Adenovirus may not be the cause?,2,molvfh,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/molvfh/astrozeneca_vaccine_clotting_adenovirus_may_not/,2,"I have a hypothesis, but I'm not convinced that the adenovirus vector itself is linked to the rare blood clots seen in the astrozeneca vaccine.

The Johnson and Johnson uses a similar platform, but statistical significance in clotting seems much smaller. The EU is investigating 4 cases of clotting in over 4 mil vaccinations. There were over 8 cases in Germany when vaccinations were at 1.4 mil.

The JJ uses a different adenovirus vector, and has a different code for the spike protein-most similar to the one used in Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Given that adenoviruses are common among infections to humans, this may not be the cause. The JJ uses a human adenovirus compared to Astrozenecas chimp adenovirus. If both vectors cause clotting, this would be interesting and an explanation as to why adenovirus vaccines cause clotting and not natural infection needs to be interpreted. 

The most differing thing among these vaccines is the code of the spike protein. JJ vaccines clotting rate remains close to the pfizer/Moderna vaccines. If this holds true, its likely the expression of the spike thats inducing the thrompbocytopenia and clotting.",1618151517.0,2021-04-11 07:31:57

Hello Reddit! I've posted a bunch of times on various subreddits over the last couple years about the podcast I produce with my wife, called Cult or Just Weird. With the Covid vaccine rollout, we decided the time was right to do an episode on the antivax movement. It's a two-parter, with the first part being about the science and history of vaccines, and I figured it would be something folks here in the r/VACCINES community might be interested in listening to. If you do, please let us know what you think!

Thanks in advance if you give us a listen :)

Here is the problem, I have had vasovagal syncope reactions to pain ever since I was a kid. It was amplified by situations where I was alone and woke up unconscious and confused surrounded by strangers. 
So my question is if anyone has vasovagal and already had their vaccines and can tell me their experience. I have a bag of tricks for myself including the laying down and having gatorade and cookies and I tried flexing my legs last time but it didn’t help. I guess my real hope is that someone can talk through their experience, especially if they were able to find a place to lie down during the shot and if they were held hostage longer than the 15-30 minutes. 
Thanks for any help in advance!

Hi all and thank you so much for your comments and upvotes. I had my first dose today and my site was very nice, I was able to lie down and wait as long as I wanted.

On a personal note, I feel like a hypocrite because I’ve been singing the praises of a vaccine.

**mRNA**  
On one hand with mRNA, there’s limited safety data and I feel uneasy about the possibility of getting adverse long-term side effects with new tech (like any medication, although I know mRNA technologies have been previously studied). 

**J&J (Janssen)**  
With a viral vector (Janssen), my fears of side effects are quelled with existing tech, but then I worry I won’t feel as “protected” against COVID with a \~66% efficacy. I know 95% vs. 66% is not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison due to how the studies were conducted, either.

Hey there everybody, I'm in a little bit of an awkward situation and I'm hoping someone here might be able to give some guidance.

I also have done work for the public defenders.

Is it possible then to schedule an appointment to obtain a vaccine for someone in my position? Would I qualify as an essential worker?

So today I went to the doctor and described what happened. They told me I should not get my second dose. But if I do chose that I want to I should see an allergist first. Now I don't know if it's really worthwhile going through this whole process to get another dose. I just feel kind of disappointed.

Any sign of Johnson & Johnson / Janssen blood clot risks?,9,mispcj,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/mispcj/any_sign_of_johnson_johnson_janssen_blood_clot/,12,"From my (uneducated) readings, there are some similarities between the astrazeneca vaccine and j&j.  Namely the adenoviruses delivery vector.

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) reports that 3.6 million people have received the j&j vaccine already in the USA.

[https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/meldungen/faq-temporaere-aussetzung-astrazeneca.pdf?\_\_blob=publicationFile&v=2](https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/meldungen/faq-temporaere-aussetzung-astrazeneca.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2) indicates in point #3 (use Google translate if needed), that cases of CVT (brain blood clots) occurred within 4-16 days of receiving astrazeneca vaccine.

Could someone more educated help me understand if there are potential blood clot risks with J&J based on what it has in common with astrazeneca, and if enough time and people have already received it that if there were significant risks of CVT reports would have popped up already?

I understand the risk with astrazeneca can be seen as small/extremely rare.  But it's a touch more concerning if you (or someone you love) fits the ""young women"" category and you're prone to worrying.

I work at a crowded retail bank branch with huge number of people coming in and not maintaining social distancing.

I am otherwise healthy except for some weight loss recently. The only vaccine available in Bangladesh is the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine produced from India. The vaccine is freely given to anyone over 40, and those in public/high risk occupations such as banker it has started to be given to people below 40 as well now. India has stopped exports of the vaccine so there might be shortages in the future. Right now, due to shortages people are getting the second dose 8 weeks apart and for people who took the first dose in February, they still haven't gotten the second dose. So I will have to assume, that I might not get the second dose at all.

Now, I have read on how Canada, Germany and several countries has suspended the use of the vaccine in people below 50-60 years because of the deaths from blood clotting.

I don't know if I'm going to feel sick after getting them or if there are any side effects. I'm also not totally sure which are the ones that I need to receive, as well as how to receive them. I don't have health insurance, a PCP, or any money saved. Do they cost money? Is it expensive? I just don't know.

I just would like to understand how the vaccine works.  I think I get the broad overview but I have questions that I haven’t been able to find the answer too.

My understanding is you get the vaccine and the messenger RNA tells your body to make the spike protein.  Your body then makes the antibodies against the spike protein.  This way if you get the virus your body will be able to attack it. This is different from say the Flu shot where you get the live or dead flu and your body when introduced make antibodies to fight the flu.

So my questions are as follows.

Your bodies immune system attacks the spike protein or does it attack covid after the spike is attacked? 

If it only attacks the spike so that it can’t attach and replicate I assume the virus just dies out in the body?

Are all spike proteins different based on the their corresponding virus? Virus probably isn’t the best way to phrase that but just want to clarify your body getting your immune system to attack this s protein is only specific to covid.  Or is it possible the s protein has similarities to other s proteins that would cause your body to attack those?

If anyone can help clarify this or point me to some articles or journals that discuss this it would be appreciated, especially if they are not overly technical.  Bio class was too long ago for me to remember clearly.  All the searches I have seen just provide me with a broad overview of it, how it won’t change your DNA etc.

I live in Texas and everyone knows that soon all adults will be eligible to receive the vaccine. However, when I got my doses I saw an elderly man asking how did I get an appointment and how can he sign up. He wasn’t as tech savvy so the pharmacy tech informed him that he can call a CVS number in order to try to see available appointments. Hopefully he received an appointment. Then I was on another wait list and they informed me it was my turn when I had already gotten the vaccine. I gave this one to my friend’s dad who had diabetes and her family was struggling to get him an appointment because they worked from 8-5. I asked my county if I can give him my appointment and they said yes. Meanwhile, this made me sad to see others struggle for this because it’s not widely available and as easy as others like to assume to sign up for an appointment.

I live in south texas and we have a lot of elderly non english speakers here so I can only imagine how hard it must be especially since most of the appointments are promised by an online link on social media (via the city’s facebook) or cable news that drops the phone number to call to set up an appointment when it’s already too late.

I've  heard a couple of times now how there's no reason to be much concerned of any serious long-term effects from the various Covid-19 vaccines (or whatever the technical term is) that have been mass-administered worldwide over the last months, as there's never been proof of any serious side-effects occuring more than six weeks after a dose (of any vaccine) have been administered ever.

I also understand that the current various Covid-19 vaccines have *not* undergone the all the standard proceedures of a vaccine trial (although they're all technically in trial still), and that the standard  time-frames of testing have been significantly reduced so as to green-light them for emergency use (which is partly why the producers have been granted full indemnity for any complications, as I understand  it).

So, my question is: is it  necessarily reasonable to extrapolate from history and conclude that there's no reason to worry in this case also, if this fact is based on previous use of vaccines that have undergone the standard proceedures for clearance, while these Covid vaccines have not? I feel like I might lack some vital information here, because I don't understand this argument as it's put forth at all.

I'm mostly ignorant in all the relevant fields here, so feel free to correct even minor details.

Although anyone can chime in with whatever, I'd appreciate if the direct responses to the question itself is from people with actual knowledge on this, as this sea of information and misinformation is difficult enough to navigate as it is.

Do inactivated virus based vaccines like Sinopharm provide better protection (if milder) against variants (broad spectrum set of antigens targeted),6,m8drbr,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/m8drbr/do_inactivated_virus_based_vaccines_like/,1,"Do the inactivated virus based Sinopharm etc. vaccines provide better protection against variants?

Since they contain a broad spectrum set of antigens/targets,  would they provide broader (if milder) immunity to variants compared to vaccines that target a few antigens?

**EDIT: 2021-04-07** - this article seems to suggest a more traditional vaccine ie an inactivated virus vaccine may confer wider immunity to variants:

Valneva to Start Final Covid Shot Trials After Positive Data
By
Thomas Mulier
and
Suzi Ring
April 6, 2021

>The vaccine uses a sample of the virus that has been killed to stimulate an immune response without causing the disease -- an approach that has been used for decades with inoculations for polio and hepatitis A. The shots currently in use in the U.K. use novel technology to deliver instructions for cells to target portions of the virus and spur immunity.
>
>The results “provide renewed hope that a vaccine using a whole inactivated virus might provide strong protection against variants,” U.K. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zawahi said in the statement. If the vaccine gets U.K. regulatory approval, “this will be another powerful weapon in our arsenal to beat this pandemic.”
>
>Valneva’s is the only vaccine based on an inactivated virus that’s this far along in clinical trials in Europe. A shot produced by China’s Sinopharm also relies on the traditional approach.
>
>Valneva may also be the first drugmaker to run a head-to-head trial pre-approval against another Covid vaccine in the U.K.
>
>Chief Executive Officer Thomas Lingelbach said in an interview in February the company didn’t see using a placebo at this stage in the vaccine rollout as ethical, and was in discussions with the U.K. regulator about using another vaccine as a comparator in the trials. 
>
>The U.K. has signed a deal worth as much as 1.4 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) to receive as many as 190 million doses of the shot between 2021 and 2025. The British government is also investing in the biotech’s Scottish manufacturing plant, where the vaccine will be created.
>
>In light of the potential plans to adapt the vaccine to variants, Valneva expects the delivery of the first 60 million doses to extend into the first quarter of 2022.
>
>The vaccine contains an adjuvant supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corp. Adjuvants are substances used to generate a more robust immune response to a vaccine.",1616176154.0,2021-03-19 10:49:14

I am anxious about Covid vaccine,5,m80rwy,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/m80rwy/i_am_anxious_about_covid_vaccine/,5,"This is the first time I post anything in reddit for a number of years and I feel pretty stupid about it but here we go..

My appointment to get the vaccine is in a few days and I was not concerned about it, I might feel sick for some days and then everything will be fine, I thought.

Until I started seeing article after article about the rare cases of blood clots and the statement that the EMA released earlier today ""however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e. low levels of blood platelets (elements in the blood that help it to clot) with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).""

Now, I am quite an anxious ticking bomb and respond terribly to information like this, and given the fact I cannot know what vaccine I will be offered until I sit on the vaccination booth I am pulling my hair out from stress right now. 

I do not know what to do. I have basically not left the house for the whole year so contracting Covid is difficult in my case and my conditions. However at the same time I know it is a privilege to have the vaccine offered to me and feel really dumb that I am even questioning myself whether I should or should not do this. I am not antivax at all, in fact I get flu shots every year and have had all vaccines available from childhood to today. 

But here I am not knowing what the best option is for me and scared that I might die from a vaccine..

"Questions regarding the Covid 19 vaccine, specifically the J&J",9,lxx1c9,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/lxx1c9/questions_regarding_the_covid_19_vaccine/,3,"So I've got some questions regarding the J&J vaccine, which will undoubtedly become the most prolific of the 3 given it's lack of the logistical challenges of the other 2 combined with the news it's about to be mass produced by 2 rival companies. With this being the case, it's likely to be the one I'll end up getting.

By the way, I'm on the list with my state health department, and whenever that day comes (sooner rather than later I hope), I'll happily take whatever they give me, I just have some concerns/questions.

It's efficacy:

So they say it's 65-70 percent effective or maybe less. They like to gloss over that number pretty quickly and jump to telling you ""But it's 100% effective at keeping you out of the hospital or dead"". This is my understanding of that:

You have a 35-30% chance that you will still contract the disease even if you've taken this vaccine, however, if you DO catch it, you will suffer much milder symptoms than if you hadn't taken it. And the ""100%"" number is derived from the fact that nobody who took this vaccine during the many trials were hospitalized or died.

Is this a correct summation?

Assuming the above is correct, my next question/concern is then regarding the so called ""long haulers"". Many if not most of them from what I understand actually only contracted a comparatively mild form of covid, but even after the virus was gone from their bodies, they still continue to suffer from lingering effects (migraines, shortness of breath, lethargy, etc.) for months in some cases. I'm wondering if this vaccine will have any positive effect on your chances of becoming a ""long-hauler"" if you are among the 30-35% who still get the disease after the J&J vaccine.

And lastly, this is more of a theoretical (somewhat, as most of us will end up with this vaccine probably) question regarding herd immunity and my shallow understanding of it. I take it to mean:

Enough of a population has become resistant to the virus through vaccine or by catching it and having ant-bodies that so drastically reduces the chances of even non-immune individuals of catching it that it's effectively a non-issue and even potentially dies off.

I've been hearing numbers like 75-80% would have to be ""immune"" to reach this.

Let's say we were starting fresh and nobody had the vaccine. Let's further say I was able to snap my fingers and vaccinate the 80% of the US with the J&J vaccine...

Well... given the efficacy rate of 65% of the J&J vaccine, it would be a mathematical impossibility for us to reach 80% immunity, we could only reach 65% immunity if that number is correct. Thus meaning that herd immunity should be impossible with the J&J vaccine alone. With this calculation, it would be impossible to reach even if I were to give 100% of the population the vaccine.

Someone please set me straight, much appreciated.",1614925221.0,2021-03-04 22:20:21

If severe disease means you require hospitalization, how can something be 85% effective against severe disease yet demonstrate complete protection against hospitalization?   That implies somebody is getting severe disease but does not require hospitalization?

Because I got my second Covid shot the sixth of January, so I am past the 14 days to build antibodies...I donated blood at the hospital I work at on Monday, they did an antibody test, and the results say I am negative for covid antibodies. I work with positive patients, my wife had it, my dogs had it...I never got sick. Maybe I was asymptomatic,  but after getting vaccinated and still showing negative, I have to consider that my knowledge of how vaccines work must be a little questionable. If it has been that long after my vaccine shouldn't I have antibodies? Or does it not work that way?",1614393657.0,2021-02-26 18:40:57

I have not read any conspiracy theories, and I most definitely do not think it will turn me into a cow or something. However, we have only done tests for <1 year, so how are we sure that there will be no effects that show up, say, 2 years later? You could say that applies to every vaccine I take, but those methods have been used for so long, without many adverse effects. However, mRNA vaccines are completely new, and we don’t have any data on what will, or can happen after this period of 1 year.

Is there any reason for me not to be concerned? I will definitely get vaccinated for covid sooner or later, but it’s really all about the type of vaccine I choose. As far as I’m aware, Novavax will offer a vaccine with the traditional method.",1614330547.0,2021-02-26 01:09:07

On the other hand, the oak pollen is off the scale here right now and if I show up sniffling and coughing due to pollen (I have been taking Allegra every day because of this) I am afraid they will show me the door for fear I have covid.  The consent form asks if I have had the sniffles, cough etc - well everyone here has if they have any tree allergies at all, for well over a month.  Pollen was so bad today I had to take a Sudafed too.  Now that it's wearing off, the drip has resumed.

Any advice?  At this point I am leaning toward taking Allegra + Sudafed so tree pollen does not cost me the chance of getting vaccinated.  If this was a drive-through it might be different and they might not care, but this is an indoor event.

I had all my childhood immunisations, I’ve had the flu jab (including during pregnancy) and when we went travelling I insisted we even get the unnecessary vaccinations that we didn’t really need for the areas we were going to, just in case (Japanese encephalitis.) My child is also up to date on all of his. 

I’m in the UK and looking at the reports I was pretty upset at the idea of having the AZ vaccine when Pfizer looked much more effective (although I guess they are looking similar now) As it goes, the centre I am booked at do mainly Pfizer, and with my appointment date looming, I’ve done the worst thing imaginable...

I’ve jumped down the rabbit hole. 

None of the conspiracy theories have phased me and I’ve argued endlessly with people spreading them, but now I’ve looked online and scared myself. Mainly because the technology hasn’t been used in this way before, right? I’m just scared of potential long term problems. I’m 31! 

I’m still going to get it, but I’d rather not have the fear. Can anyone talk me down and tell me there’s really no need to worry about some debilitating condition as a result of this, a few years down the line? 

I’m not going to go into what I’ve read about previous issues with vaccines because posting this in itself is bad enough, but so people get an idea of why I’m freaking out I’ll mention the swine flu vaccine. 

Someone help me! 

I should also mention I suffer with quite bad healthy anxiety and I know this is a big contributing factor to my worry.",1614185350.0,2021-02-24 08:49:10

We are currently trying for a baby and I’m a bit concerned. I’m no believer of conspiracies and definitely want to get vaccinated but if there’s even a slight chance of becoming infertile it makes me worried. I also have diabetes and thyroid issues and also I’m over 30 so my chances are lower without anything else adding to it. I’m trying to find other women’s stories online who were also trying to concieve when getting vaccinated to see if they managed to get pregnant easily after that so it would make me less worried but all I find is the official advice on vaccination and pregnancy. Other vaccines may be better from this aspect but some (that are available where I live) are not so effective and some cannot be given to people with autoimmune deseases that I have. So my question is, do you know anyone who got pregnant after getting Pfizer? I really need some success stories here 😄 thanks!",1614199210.0,2021-02-24 12:40:10

Shortly after she was given the vaccine, her whole arm (the one she received the vaccine in) went numb. She called over the nurse, who said it was a normal reaction, and that it would go away after a while.

The numbness went away after about 15 minutes, but my mother is now slightly worried what might occur when she gets the second vaccine - since apparently the 2nd dose has been reported as causing more serious symptoms.

There really isn't many reports online of a similar numbness occurring from the Moderna vaccine, so I'm wondering if anyone here has experienced or heard of something similar? The only similar side effects seem to be a bell's palsy (facial paralysis), which ironically a relative of mine experienced from the first dose of the vaccine.

I've wanted an answer for this before and I know you've had questions about these things before but I've looked around before but haven't been able to find an answer for my question. I have a limited understanding for normal vaccines and reading of RNA and such but lower knowledge for these vaccines.

&#x200B;

1. Are the RNA in these vaccines self-replicating?
2. Will the RNA in these vaccines either just be used once to produce the protein or be used whatever amount of times to produce the protein but then be broken down (happens how?)
3. Will the immune system attack the cells presenting the protein (will all cells which get the RNA express the protein on its surface and do the immune system have access to all cells?) and through that way remove the last traces of the RNA and stop the production of ""foreign"" protein?

I ask these questions because I want to have some understanding / chance to think for myself for about how safe they can be. If the RNA are only utilized for a short amount of time to produce the spike protein or a similar one and then the body make antibodies for that and that's it then that's the best case scenario I guess. If the RNA are copied and possibly also spread in the body (can it? At-least the injected fluid can enter them of course) or ""hang around forever"" then I guess an immune system response which killed those cells would kinda remove that ""problem"" if one think it is one. Though I don't know which cells are infected and how many and how fine that is. And last if the RNA would hang around ""forever"" through whatever means producing the protein then I guess I wonder about some sort of disease where the body is attacked for a long time or lots of cells are killed or whatever.

I just want to understand it that's all. For a normal vaccine I'd assume the immune system kill the infected cells?

I’ve gotten past hypochondria. I control my panic attacks but that doesn’t mean they aren’t a terrible experience just that I can usually get through them a bit quicker. 

Both doses caused me to experience heightened anxiety. I was also quite symptomatic with side effects the first time and anticipate I will be again this time. My arm hurt like hell. I was whiny and emotional. 

I was looking for more reassurance ahead of my first and second one so I want to offer that to anyone who is in the same boat. I did a lot of research before making the decision to get the vaccine and can offer up credible resources if you’d like it. But if you just want to ask questions about how I am feeling as I experience any possible side effects, and coming from someone who will likely manifest them regardless haha, reach out!

Update: It’s approaching the 24 hour mark post second vaccination aaaand... I feel great! In fact, my arm was intensely sore but I woke up with more mobility in it than I did on day two of the first dose. I would say so far, I feel better after the second dose than the first one. It’s relieving. I may have something creep on over the next day but we’ll see! With both vaccines I had clammy... FEET. Haha. I never get clammy feet and hours after both doses that was a stand out symptom. I have some body aches but I also started my period today so it could be attributed more to that.

Update#2: It’s now been just over 72 hours since my second dose. Aside from what I mentioned above, I continually felt great. Possibly some body aches and moments of fatigue but that overlapped with a couple of other factors leading me to believe the entirety of my side effects from the vaccine were limited to the arm pain.

How long did it take to vaccinate the public with old vaccines?,7,lae6cv,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/lae6cv/how_long_did_it_take_to_vaccinate_the_public_with/,1,"I live in Germany and the pace at which the coronavirus vaccines are administered is frustratingly slow. While in the UK 14 percent of the population are vaccinated, in Germany it's barely three. One reason could be the gutting of the health sector over the past years and decades, poor logistics and the rule suggested by the commission of ethics and established by the government that people over 80 are to receive the vaccine first. Seems logical, right? Not really, if you think about the fact that the majority of the vaccine isn't even used. The vials are there, nurses and doctors are ready, younger and older people could all be vaccinated _simultaneously_ like they do it in Israel where almost 60 percent reveiced one or two shots already. But instead, they were mainly vaccinating people in nursing homes, something that's hard to do from a purely technical and logistical standpoint. So yeah, if you limit yourself to nursing homes and don't use doctor's offices and hospitals, sure it'll take forever to apply the vaccine. 

So what I'm curious about is comparing this with historical vaccination programs. How long did it take from the approval of the classic vaccines like against the measles, smallpox or tuberculosis until herd immunity was reached through vaccination? Months, years, decades? I know the polio vaccine was recommended in the US from 1963 until 2000. Will it be like that with the COVID-19 vaccines as well?",1612242445.0,2021-02-01 21:07:25

HPV vaccine interval and doses,3,la3tkf,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/la3tkf/hpv_vaccine_interval_and_doses/,1,"I recognize this isn't a place for official medical advice. My intent in posting is to get educated opinions and outside perspectives.

Background: I'm 30. I grew up in a sexually repressive religion (mormonism) and experienced a lot of shame/guilt around sexuality and pressure to marry. I'm no longer religious, but I've only ever been intimate to any degree with a single person (my current wife). She received her HPV vaccine when she was younger. Recently, we've been considering opening our relationship, which would mean increased potential for HPV exposure.

The above considered, and from what I've read about the rationale for the current upper age recommendation by the ACIP approved schedule (most people likely already having been exposed by 26), I feel like I would uniquely stand to benefit from getting the vaccine, so I've been considering it.

I've also read that one or two doses of the vaccine may be mostly, if not similarly, as effective as three doses. I know there are trials planned or in progress to assess that.

The current recommendations provide minimum intervals between doses, but no maximum intervals, recommending resuming where you left off if you've had previous doses.

Though the FDA expanded approval through age 45 a few years ago, since the ACIP approved schedule still only includes through age 26 (recommending ""shared clinical decision making"" above that age), my insurance wouldn't cover it. Since it would be paid out of pocket (and it's expensive), I'm considering getting two doses for now, and maybe eventually getting a final dose in the future.

My question is, based on any understanding of the immune response, would it likely be better to wait a month or so between doses 1 and 2 for an optional response? Or would it be better to wait at least 6 months? Also, any additional perspectives on anything in my post would be appreciated.",1612217271.0,2021-02-01 14:07:51
Talking about RNA vaccines,7,l937yh,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/l937yh/talking_about_rna_vaccines/,6,"In the past few months, I've been asked many times by many different people to explain to them how the new COVID-19 vaccine works. First, I'm delighted at people's willingness to ask and the want to understand a complex topic. Secondly, I'm honored they asked me. I am not a teacher, not a doctor, I don't work in a medical field with patients and I don't have any degrees beyond a humble bachelor's of science. 

What I do have is a knack for speaking to people. I enjoy talking and having conversations. The best way to have any conversation is to positively engage people in the topics and actively listen to what they have to say. It's nice. 

So, because I have had the opportunity of explaining how RNA vaccines work to a delightful range of people while also having a good time of it, I want to share how I do that. This isn't actually about how RNA vaccines work, but more of how I recommend having a conversation about them. I want to put some tips here for those knowledge-happy folks out there who may find this type of conversation wildly out of their comfort level.

1) Find your listeners ""level"".

RNA vaccines are a complex topic and can be very difficult to explain. I've found one of the best ways of finding out how much, and what type, of explaining I need to do is to ask my listener to explain TO ME how they understand ""normal"" vaccines work. That gives me a lot of information. How they explain concepts to me is how they understand concepts. If they draw a picture (or use their hands a lot) they're likely a visual learner and I try to grab a pen and paper. If they use lots of technical terms, I'm speaking to someone who would not appreciate a kindergarten-style breakdown. If my listener can't seem to deliver a confident explanation of how vaccines work, I know I have to start with basics and work my way up from there. 

Asking what they know about vaccines also does two more things. It lets me hear any misunderstandings they have about vaccines that I may need to clear up before we move on to RNA vaccines. If I can ensure my listener knows how vaccines works it makes them feel like they have a chance at understanding the ""new"" one. It makes the knowledge of how vaccines work a reliable baseline we can both reference when confusion about the new one arises. 
The last thing asking about their vaccine understanding does it allows them to speak, speak first, and set the tone. No one likes a one-sided akward conversation. I want them to talk with me. 

2) Avoid, I mean really really make an effort here, telling them they are ""wrong"".

There is a lot of misinformation out there, and especially around vaccines. I've heard it all, or at least I really hope I have. No one, especially people who come to me asking about how something works, wants to hear they are wrong. That's not why they came to me. They came to understand, and that is my focus. I don't say:
""Wow that is absolutely NOT true!""
""Who told you THAT? She's crazy.""
""Hahahaha, no. That's not how it works.""
No one likes to hear these things. People don't want to stay in a conversation where they or their sources of information are insulted. They came for understanding, not criticism.
A way I've found of avoiding telling someone they are wrong while also correcting misunderstandings, is to ask them if I can explain how I understand the concept. Asking them for permission gives me the invitation into this difficult discussion with them. I avoid directly saying that what I explain is the correct concept, as that implies they are incorrect. If they have questions about how my explanation is different then theirs I focus only on the reasons behind the difference. I explain only my ""version"" of the concept. I don't directly correct their previous understandings, unless they ask me to, as they are already attempting to do so themselves by asking me questions.

3) Celebrate and build knowledge.

Without a basic understanding of cellular biology, true understanding of RNA vaccines is near impossible. Biology is not everyone's favorite subject and many people find it both boring and difficult. So, regardless of if your listener has a master's degree in Engineering or slept through biology in high school, acknowledge any knowledge they do have and celebrate it. Science yeah! If they know what a nucleus is and that it contains your DNA, acknowledge that they are correct and are already on their way to understanding RNA! Try to use the terms and concepts they know as much as possible to show their knowledge contributed to the conversation. It will be their anchor as you begin to build on it to explain more complex topics.
""You already know DNA contains important information. We both understand how precious DNA is to the body, and your cells work hard to protect it too. That's why DNA lives in the nucleus. It's very safe there. Did you know DNA never leaves the nucleus? This is why RNA is so neat....""

4) Go slowly, and watch for clues.

Don't rush understanding. People learn at different speeds and with different styles.  If your listener suddenly got quiet, goes glassy eyed or stopped asking questions, be sure to stop and ask how they are doing. This is a conversation, not a lecture. Ask if there is anything you can do or further explain to help them.
You may have to scrap your delivery halfway though with a quick ""I'm sorry, I am going too far into details that don't help. Can I start over?"" Sometimes taking time to repeat yourself or incorporate the same concept in a different example pays off in reinforcing understanding.

5) Allow yourself to be interrupted

If your listener has a question, that means they are thinking. Thinking is what we both want! This conversation isn't about you or some show of your knowledge. Don't allow the opportunity to work with them as they develop new concepts to pass you by. Tell them they are free to stop you at any point for questions. Try to understand or address a reason they have the question, it's part of acknowledgement. Often enough, the question they have was something you were about to say which is yet another opportunity to praise them for their understanding.
""I'm so glad you asked about virus varients. They're all over the news right now and it's scary. You understand how vaccines work! What if COVID-19 mutates on the protein we just trained your body to fight? That's no good. Well, the scientists who developed this thought of that and here is why you hear the vaccines still work.....""

6) Don't fret over details

It would take hours and lots of chalk to explain to someone the exact process of an RNA vaccine. Ain't nobody got time for that. People want understanding, not a degree. Sometimes all someone wants to know about it is a specific question like ""Does it alter my DNA?"" or ""Is it safe?"". I make sure to steer the conversation to answer their core questions which means I may skip details like how the RNA vaccine actually gets into your cells or what type of protein it produces. I can always talk to those details after I get to their main query or I will incorporate them into one of their questions if it's relevant. I do try to, at minimum, establish a basic understanding of vaccines but the level of detail I go into is very specific to the person. As long as you're seeing a correct understanding of the concepts, you've accomplished the goal and that was the whole point. You can stop explaining details. Don't bore them you nerd.
When I am faced with someone with less than a basic understanding of biology, I resort to speaking to the concepts by comparing them to something non-biological. This is actually my favorite style of conversation because it can be really fun. I once explained RNA thusly: ""The Queen in her palace needs to get a message to her blacksmith, so instead of walking and talking to him (which would expose her to danger) she writes a secret coded message that when the blacksmith reads it he know what he needs to build. Also the message explodes after he's done reading it.""
The shortest comparison I've come up with (and one I'm most proud of) is: 
""So normal vaccines work by dragging dead or dying enemies through the village that is your body and shouting 'These are the bad guys! Look at them!'. RNA vaccines work by asking you to print a wanted poster.""
Being creative, even if your delivery isn't perfect, is fun for you both and again, this is a conversation. You can always try again. 

7) You don't know everything. 

Sorry, but you don't. Being honest about this to yourself and even your listener is appreciated. If my listener has a question I don't know an answer to I'm not going to risk being yet another source of misinformation. I firstly compliment them for asking such a good question, acknowledge why they are asking and if they have time, we learn together! Sometimes it's a technical question where the articles from Google may be above their level. Or there are a lot of bad, misleading articles. I offer to quickly read up on the topic for them and when I feel confident I come back to them with the answer. 

I truly enjoy having these conversations, and the real understanding that my friends and family achieve makes this crazy pandemic a little less stressful. These tips may not work for everyone, and you don't have to find each of them useful but I hope I helped at least one other soul out there with this difficult conversation.",1612091922.0,2021-01-31 03:18:42

When the Covid vaccine becomes readily  available to the general public, do you think you will get it? I am totally 100% for vaccines and I obviously believe that everyone should get vaccinated but I am just worried about the potential long term adverse effects. Because it’s being rolled out so quickly, we haven’t really had the time to assess the long term side affects like they usually do with vaccines (hence why they take several years to be rolled out). I am currently also pregnant and worried about how it may affect the foetus if it were to become available to me before I give birth. Is anyone else wondering about this?

Global equity what would be the best approach?,1,l7x8gh,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/l7x8gh/global_equity_what_would_be_the_best_approach/,1,"Hi everyone. Like many, I've been reading a lot about the vaccines for Covid19 that scientists have been working on with the hopes that every country will work towards herd immunity thanks to the vaccines and we can all hope to have our normal lives again.

However, it appears that there aren't enough vaccines being made and to be distributed at this time to ensure that enough people in the world could be vaccinated to get to herd immunity before 2023. 

If this is the case, shouldn't we be prioritizing people who are high risks (older people, health workers, essential workers, teachers) and people with commorbidities all over the world before each country extends the vaccination of younger people?

I (32F) have been staying at home since March of last year and honestly, as much as I am willing to take the vaccine, I would be really uncomfortable with the notion of getting vaccinated before all those who are most likely to be exposed and die from the disease. I'd be willing to pass on my own vaccination to ensure better equity in my country but also around the world.

So, I’m supposed to get the covid vaccine next week. But I’m DEATHLY afraid of needles. I have a massive panic attack whenever a doctor puts one near me, last time I had a shot it took an hour. I CANT have a freak out in this nice little clinic, so I figured if I got pretty high beforehand (on weed) I’d be fine. 
Medically, how bad of an idea is this?

The first day/evening I simply had a mildly sore arm.

I woke up at 7AM on 1/13/21 and noticed that I was generally achy & fatigued with back & joint pain (I feel this way whenever I’m fighting a virus). I ended up getting chills and a fever of 101.3 in the afternoon of 1/13/21. I monitored my fever and it went down to 100.0 before I took ibuprofen for a migraine that developed around 5PM. I stayed in bed all day, was too weak to do anything else. I really felt like crap.

I am now 47 hours from my first dose and I feel 100% normal. My arm is still slightly sore but it’s barely noticeable. All symptoms & fever are gone so I’m back at work. My coworkers all reported their worst symptoms yesterday (1/13) as well.

I will update when I get my second dose in about a month!

UPDATE 2/10/21: I got my second dose yesterday at 1:30PM and I bled like hell immediately, it dripped almost completely down my bicep but the paramedic held pressure and it was fine. I didn’t feel the vaccine go into my tissue as much as I did with the first dose.

Around 2 hours afterward, I began feeling slightly fatigued then 7 hours after the dose, I got a fever of 101. 

The next morning I woke up fatigued with lower back & knee pain. It initially felt exactly the same as the first dose but as the day went on, I actually had a little more energy and did some chores. I went to the grocery store but my lower back was REALLY killing me by then. I never took anything for the pain, just ate fruits & veggies and drank lots of water.

I’m now feeling totally normal, ready to return to work tomorrow!

Me, my wife and our one year old son got sick between 6-20 December 2020.

As a family we took precautions (mask wearing, hand sanitization , social distancing). 
Unfortunately, our son got infected via his day care provider. 

He was the first to show symptoms which was an 18 hour fever between 6-7 December. He did not subsequently show any other symptoms (that we are aware of).

Due to my son’s fever, my wife and I began to quarantine and got tested on 8 December. We , much to our surprise, tested positive but decided not to test my son due to the invasive nature of the test. The day care provider tested positive as well.

During our illness, my wife experienced fatigue, “sinus like “symptoms and diminished taste/smell.

I experienced fatigue, fever, complete loss of taste and smell and a slight cough.

We stayed quarantined at home, managed the symptoms and by the 10th day of our illness, we felt better.

Other that the fever, our son seemed and seems fine. His behavior (eat, sleep, play, poop etc) has not changed.

My wife still has “sinus” issues but at this time of year, it is not unusual.

I am fine and feel 100% normal.

Short-lived adverse reaction to flu-vaccine??,3,kwvb60,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/kwvb60/shortlived_adverse_reaction_to_fluvaccine/,6,"I just have a genuine question about the flu vaccine. I received it last week and had a weird reaction, but the pharmacists weren't helpful, and I'd like more insight.

Background info that may be applicable: The last time I got the flu vaccine was in 2016. My only reasoning for not usually getting the vaccine is because I can't remember the last time I had the flu, and I only got the vaccine in '16 because my youngest brother was born around that time and they said it was required for me to see him. The reason I got the flu vaccine this year is because I started a new job at a hospital, so it is required. I have not had any adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, including the tetanus booster I received last year (2020). 

I got the vaccine at a Smith's (Kroger) pharmacy. Within about one or two minutes post-injection, I was having hot-cold flashes and I was NAUSEOUS. I ran all the way across the store to the bathroom because I thought I was going to vomit. I sat over the toilet until my stomach calmed (it took only a minute) but I was still clammy and shaky. 

When I came out of the bathroom, my brother commented on how pale I was, even with a mask covering my face. I pulled the mask down and his eyes got big. I usually have red cheeks from rosacea, but my face was all white. My forehead was sweaty as well. 

I went and asked one of the pharmacists if that was a normal reaction, but she wasn't particularly helpful. She said, ""Well, if you've been in contact with someone with the flu recently, you may still be susceptible. It takes two weeks for the vaccine to build immunity."" I was like... what??? I'm here because I almost threw up right after getting the vaccine and I want to know if that is a normal reaction. And I had not been around anyone with the flu. (I also have not thrown up EVER since 2014 when I got my wisdom teeth removed. And the last time I threw up prior to that was in 2010 when I went into mild shock from an injury.)

She got the lead pharmacist who just said, ""You should probably just sit down for a minute."" They both eventually admitted that my reaction wasn't normal, but they couldn't offer any help. The lead pharmacist just told me to go to the ER if the symptoms worsened. They didn't, thank goodness. I was weirdly emotional during this as well. I didn't cry, but I had a lump in my throat. 

My mother, who is a social worker, said it sounds like I had a panic attack, but I don't have a history of panic attacks and I didn't feel anxious, just really sick. My dad, who is ex-military, said it sounded like I went into shock. If that is the case, why did it happen? I hate shots, but I don't overreact when I get them. I just look away and try to breathe until it's over. 

I did try looking up my symptoms, but I was having a hard time finding anything that was helpful. I did also feel better by the time I got home about 20 minutes later.

I primarily just think what happened was very strange, so if anyone has any ideas or insight, that would be much appreciated!",1610617066.0,2021-01-14 01:37:46

Is there any possibility that the COVID mRNA vaccine might be carrying any type of molecule or protein that impacts fertility in any way? Could it be traceable ? Is it even possible?

Got the Pfizer vaccine💉,42,kl71s0,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/kl71s0/got_the_pfizer_vaccine/,15,"Vaccine Facts (Pfizer):
1. It’s mRNA, not a small dose of COVID - The vaccine is basically sending a messenger to tell your body to produce proteins that will destroy COVID-19 as the virus tries to enter your body.

2. mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or 🧬 code.

3. It was tested on 44,000+ participants in a double blinded placebo study. Half of the patients received the vaccine, other half received the placebo. 

4. ~95% efficacy rate. Effective rate we’ll find in due time. The ~95% efficacy rate came from the results of the phase 3 trial in which 162 placebo recipients got infected with COVID-19 vs. the 8 vaccine recipients who got infected (out of 22,000+ participants from each group). If interested, DM me for the math to how pfizer got to ~95% efficacy with those numbers.

5. The vaccine is named BNT162b2 and will be given in 2💉💉 doses 21 days apart. Make sure to take the 2nd dose to achieve & maintain the ~95% efficacy rate. The first dose will prime your body to create the spike proteins needed to destroy the anatomy of the corona virus 🦠. The second dose will build the army of spike proteins to keep you protected. The length of time the 2 doses will protect against COVID-19 is to be determined. The participants from March 2020 are still protected at the ~95% efficacy rate, so it is promising.

Reasons why you don’t want the vaccine:
1. Speed of approval - this has been the fastest vaccine ever produced in the history of mankind. 
Ans: This is the 1st mRNA vaccine to be produced by intelligent scientists, doctors, and highly advanced technology. Speed doesn’t mean less efficient, we should realize how much science has advanced.

2. Long term effects - It is too soon to know the long term effects of this vaccine.
Ans: mRNA is fragile and will disintegrate in your body if you don’t keep it going. Every drug we take has side effects. Pfizer also makes viagra, a side effect being an inability to differentiate between the colors green and blue😯.

3. Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) - will the vaccine give me GBS?
Ans: There is no evidence to link GBS to the mRNA vaccine. The ratio of people who received the vaccine and have GBS is consistent with the yearly ratio of GBS incidence in the United States.

4. Government- Can’t trust them.
Ans: True. Especially for people of color, I totally understand. But we also have to focus on how many intellectuals🧠 and advancements in tech it took to bring forth this vaccine. I feel more comfortable when I think about the intellectuals. This vaccine would not be here if it wasn’t for them. Government=Politics and its understandable if they are not to be trusted. But intellectuals=science and it is amazing that we even have this vaccine available, Dr. Fauci approved😁.

5. 44,000 participants - is this enough to push the vaccine to the public?
Ans: Hats off to these brave people 🎩. Especially since they were double blinded with either the vaccine or placebo. There are a lot more people now who have taken the vaccine. Few have gotten anaphylactic shock, most had a sore arm. If side effects worry you, stop taking other drugs you take either by recreation or prescription🤷🏻‍♂️. 

Who shouldn’t take the vaccine:
1. If you’re under 16 yrs of age
2. If you have any allergies to the Pfizer vaccine components (see link below)
https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download 

Take with caution if:
1. You’re pregnant or planning to be pregnant
2. Have allergies to other vaccines
3. Take immunosuppressants or you are immunocompromised.
Of course speak with your doctor if you have concerning underlying medical conditions.

Don’t take the vaccine if you currently have COVID. If you had COVID or you are over the quarantine period, then yes - take the vaccine. Your antibodies will help you for only ~90days if you recovered from the virus, according to present studies. 

Why you should take the vaccine:

Benefits outweigh risks. Simple as that.

We are all probably desensitized by now but the deaths and infection rate is staggering (This is probably the only fact that has been consistent through our battle with this virus, consider all the changes with your hospital/CDC/media etc.)
Take a look: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
Patients are on multiple forms of life support, bleeding out from every orifice of their body, unable to breathe, unable to move due to fever and body aches. If you didn’t have someone you really loved in the hospital, you don’t know what it’s like. No visitors, maximum isolation, loneliness and delay of care is expected as we are all trying to protect ourselves from this microscopic organism. 
Woohoo for you if you were asymptomatic with COVID, you don’t know what long term effects it will have on you either.

With all said,
Do humanity a favor, take the vaccine.

Ps. Of course you can make you’re own decision, this is 🇺🇸:)

Question about Aluminum vs. Aluminum Compound in vaccines,3,kl5ktl,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/kl5ktl/question_about_aluminum_vs_aluminum_compound_in/,6," 

Hi,

I have some questions related to Aluminum. The background for the question is that my wife is now an anti-vaxxer. She has done some Aluminum de-tox program and she wants to do the same with my son. As I am grounded in science, have a family of nurses etc., I think that vaccines do more good than harm.

However as I am not a medical expert, I'd like to understand more. So far the discussion with her is that she says Aluminum is bad and that it is included in vaccines.

I am trying to understand the science behind it to hopefully have a logical conversation about it.

Below are the questions. As the topic seems complex, I tried to break it down into a few different questions that captures the different aspect of the topic.

&#x200B;

1. Is Aluminum (the element, not compounds) objectively dangerous to humans? She mentioned that there is research that says Aluminum causes all sorts of bad diseases in humans.

2a. From what I understand, the Aluminum Adjuvant included in vaccines are Aluminum-compounds (Aluminum + some other element). Some of the ones used are: aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, alum (potassium aluminum sulfate). Are these Aluminum-compounds objectively dangerous to humans?

2b. Does the compounds split into their elemental components once inside your body? E.g. is it possible that the Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH\^3) splits into elemental Aluminum, Oxygen and Hydrogen once inside our bodies?

3a. Is the maximum safe level of Aluminum for humans defined based on elemental Aluminum only or also includes Aluminum compounds?

3b. What is the maximum safe level of Aluminum for humans? And how does this correlate to the amounts given to babies based on their weight. E.g. an average baby is 3.5 Kgs. An average 6 month-old is 16 kgs etc. E.g. 5mg per pound means for babies, the maximum safe level is much, much less than for an adjust.

Thanks!",1609112243.0,2020-12-27 15:37:23

So like 8 years ago I had the rabies vaccine (the 3 jab one that you get before any possible contact), and the nurse at the time told me that if I was bitten, I would still need to go to a hospital and get some more jabs (I’d just need to get slightly less than if I hadn’t had the vaccine). But why did the first lot not make me immune? Any other vaccine I have had - measles, for example - I was immune once I’d had the jabs and everything had kicked in. But that doesn’t seem to be the case for rabies.

Maybe it’s me misunderstanding what immunity means, but in my mind if I’m immune to something then I don’t have to worry about further injections after potential exposure. So what is it about rabies that makes that not the case? Is to do with the vaccine, to do with the disease, or a little bit of both?

What happens when you get a vaccine?
Who are the people who don’t get vaccinated (like the people who can’t. I forget what the word is, but immunocompromised or something like that I think?)

I have an unknown autoimmune disorder. Does this mean I’m one of the people who shouldn’t get vaccinated?

I feel like I should get vaccinated but I’m really nervous because my body is really picky and I tend to have bad luck.

1. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain mRNA encapsulated in a structure which allows the mRNA to penetrate human cells.
2. The mRNA uses the cells own protein synthesis mechanism to induce the cell to create a protein which is a close enough match for the spike protein that naturally encapsulates the Sars-cov-2 virus, that a immune reaction to the vaccine created spike proteins will ensure a rapid immune reaction to the SC2 virus spike protein
3. The mRNA vaccines need to be maintained at very low temperatures throughout their existence to maintain the integrity of the encapsulating structure.

Vaccines can potentially serve three different purposes: they can prevent an infection by blocking a virus from invading cells in the body; they can reduce the risk of serious illness if a person is infected; or they can reduce the amount of virus a person “sheds,” essentially curbing a person’s ability to transmit the virus to others.
“The challenge is that not all vaccines can do all three,” said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York. 
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, and the Moderna vaccine is 94.5 percent effective at reducing infection, but neither of the trials were designed to focus on whether the shots could prevent infection altogether — or what effect they could have on transmission.
The
CDC has said
that until more is known about how the vaccines perform under real-life conditions, “it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic.”
That includes wearing a mask, washing hands frequently and staying six feet apart from others.
“A vaccine is a very important tool in our arsenal, but we also can’t overestimate it,” Lee said. “We have to layer all these interventions on top of each other to make them more effective.”",1608001352.0,2020-12-14 19:02:32

But my concern is what happens to the mRNA and the amino acids our bodies were going to be spending time and energy on originally? Will the cells in our bodies be able to work on the OG mRNA and the new synthetic one simultaneously? Or will the injection cause a disruption in amino acid production throughout the body? Is there potential for negative impact from this? Or will the body create some sort of compensation program for this? ( like it can with the circulatory system when it is interrupted?)

But it’s not just enough to have a high ‘n’. How did the vaccine scientists make sure that the study population encompassed different kinds of people? Were the study populations all volunteer based? Wouldn’t healthier people self-select to be in the trials?

Early during the pandemic, my mom and brother got COVID (they're health care workers). My brother felt badly for a week or so, but recovered with no lasting effects. My mom, however, was a different story. She took over a month to start recovering. Although she wasn't hospitalized, she came pretty close. She did develop a tremor that has stayed with her and has seen several specialists that suggested that it was COVID related. 

Today, my mom sent me something that she recorded...a clip of a cardiologist on Fox News fear mongering (shocker) in regards to the vaccine. He was saying that he believed that the COVID vaccine will be dangerous, ""even life threatening!"" to children and he's appalled that anyone would even consider giving ""an untested"" vaccine to children. He continued bring up antibody dependent enhancement and ""the survival rate is 99.994%"". 

We're getting the vaccines - all of us. My husband doesn't really have a choice, but I do. We're in agreement that not only will I be vaccinated, but our children will be, as well. 

I know she's going to bring this up again, so please help me. I need sources. Where can I find the study and safety info on the vaccines that are coming out? Where can I find general info regarding the reason people skills be vaccinated even though a disease has a high survival rate? What is the liklihood that antibody dependent enhancement will actually be a problem and where can I find reliable info on that?

The antigens are indeed identical, or am I missing something? Or has it to do with the amount, does the vaccine contain higher amounts of the antigen thus it is more likely to induce a response?

HELP! Just found out my friends are Vaccine resistant and don't want to vaccinate any future kids,15,k1yt6g,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/k1yt6g/help_just_found_out_my_friends_are_vaccine/,7,"Hi, everyone. Please, I need your help with this. (My friends are located in Canada 🇨🇦 btw).

We were talking about how I cannot go out because, even if I take every precaution, I don't want to risk getting COVID and infect my grandma since she is very very high-risk (besides bein in her 70's, she's got diabetes, and other ailments that would make it worse for her if she's infected). When told this, they told me they weren't going to vaccinate because they think vaccines can be harmful. I asked them about it, and thought at the beginning they were talking about the bad secondary effects of the UK COVID vaccine during the trials, but no, they meant vaccines in General. I asked if when they had kids, would they vaccinate them? They told me they would be vaccinating them with the most important ones, but not all of them, and also because they believe some vaccines cause Autism; don't ask which, they didn't have a list at hand, and they are not having kids in the near future, so I don't think they are worried about it for now, but they definitely want to have kids in the future.

Let me highlight the fact that they (a couple) are intelligent individuals, but this is outside their area of expertise,, and I feel like they have been lied to; they are **vaccine-resistant** meaning they are fearful of it, but I feel they could be suaded with the right reliable information.

The problem apparently stems from 2 issues:

1. They watched a documentary where they showed cases where vaccines did harm. We didn't go into detail about it, but I did tell them I'd bet them anything I could debunk it with reliable sources, and although doubtful, agreed to look it up and send me the name or link to it.
2. One of them has a family member with a kid with autism (far into the spectrum it seems; Non-verbal), and they are afraid a vaccine would cause that to their (future) kid(s).

So, I want to be able to give them all the information. And I mean ALL the information I can in the best way possible. I will talk to them tomorrow (since it's late and they were going to sleep) and ask them to please let me do them a presentation to show and answer any questions they have; they are not anti-vaxxers, just vaccine-resistant, so I believe they would be open to hearing me out, but I need help with reliable sources please. So far, the presentation that I will be making will be including the following:

1. First, an explanation about the back-fire effect and why it is normal that they don't like facing ideas that challenge what they know. I'll probably use [The Oatmeal's comic](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe) for this.
2. What are vaccines and how they are made, and why you can't related all effects of all vaccines under the same umbrella?
3. Why parents of autist kids (An autistic person told me that this is a more preferable term than to say ""person WITH autism) usually think the condition was caused by vaccines? (Ages of usual immunization and ages of early signs of autism being around the same). Also, the difference between correlation and causation.
4. Why was this idea born in the first place? Talking about the only study that alleged that vaccines caused autism but were later debunked and the Dr.'s license was revoked because of it. How ideas once formed are difficult to get rid of it.
5. How are certain people (or enterprises) taking advantage of this fear and start spreading misinformation? This one I'm unfamiliar with, so I would gladly receive advice on this one.
6. Also, how science deniers usually try to convince people by cherry-picking bad cases, misinterpret studies by ignoring the consensus made on them. Also, an explanation about how we cannot be 100% sure of anything, and why it's importance in science to do conclusion this way. So, a good analysis of the dangers of misinterpreting science studies. I'll most likely use one of the examples in John Oliver's Last Week Tonight's episode: [Scientific Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw), like how *""No difference in preeclampsia or high-blood pressure between women that eat the two chocolates\[, high and low flavanol chocolates,\]""* was interpreted by media as ""*The Benefits of Chocolate During Pregnancy; Eating a moderate amounts of chocolate could benefit mom and baby*"".
7. A detailed explanation of the compounds of vaccines that they believe cause damage. For example, Thimerosal, the organomercurial, its function and the difference with regular mercury. Also, an explanation about how dosage works and how almost anything could kill you when your body receives a certain dosage (even water, apples and coffee). I could even show how anti-vaxxers spread fear by throwing around the names of the compounds of vaccines and debunked by showing how that could be done to ANYTHING, like Gala apples:  >!Ethanol  
Propyl acetate  
2-Methylpropyl acetate  
Propanol  
n-Butyl acetate  
2-Methylpropanol  
2-Methylbutyl acetate  
n-Butyl propanoate  
n-Butanol  
n-Pentyl acetate  
2-Methylbut-3-enyl acetate  
2-Methylbutanol  
3-Methylbut-3-enyl acetate  
3-Methylbut-3-enol  
3-Methylbut-2-enyl acetate  
n-Pentanol  
n-Hexyl acetate  
E-Hex-3-enyl acetate  
Z-Hex-3-enyl acetate

n-Hexyl-2-methyl butanoate  
n-Heptanol  
Camphor  
n-Octanol  
n-Oct-2-enol  
1 -Methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)-benzene !<
8. How autistic people see the world and how bad (appalling) it is that some people treated their condition like the plague.
9. How important is vaccination to many organizations, schools, etc. And how their kid(s) could be denied access because of their vaccination status. [Example](https://immunize.ca/immunization-mandatory-canada): In Ontario, and New Brunswick, proof of immunization is required for children and adolescents to attend public school.
10. Information about the UK COVID vaccine's news going around regarding the bad side effects of it. And the explanation of the process of developing a vaccine and why it takes so long and have so many different phases before getting to human trials and so many regulations before making it to the public.
11. Lastly, an explanation about critical thinking, and how you should always question what you learn (mostly about things that could affect greatly your life or that of others).

Also, this presentation gotta comply with the following:

1. No wall of text, only easy to digest videos, diagrams, infographics, and or any media that could help understand the information shown.
2. Reliable sources only. I will need to be able to link any claim made in the presentation to a reliable source, and also a brief explanation of the source (i.e. ""World Health Organization"", ""University X"", ""OECD iLibrary"", etc.).

And that's it. I may even make a video of it at some point but for now, I want to make this presentation. If anyone has any more topics that they think should be included, or if they have good resources (scientific articles, documentaries, studies, etc) from reliable sources, I'd greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time!",1606501789.0,2020-11-27 10:29:49

Questions on the mRNA COVID vaccines - on degradation of synthetic mRNA,6,k0ogb6,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/k0ogb6/questions_on_the_mrna_covid_vaccines_on/,5,"I read about the new mRNA vaccines and am very excited to get vaccinated, both for personal safety and also so that I can travel, and to help with herd immunity in my community. I just have a few questions based on my high school biology understanding.   


1) I understand that the natural mRNA degrades quite rapidly in body temperature, however, does the same happen for the synthetic mRNA in the Pfitzer and Moderna vaccines? This question is important for me, because if it doesn't degrade fast enough, then my ribosomes will be making lots of spike proteins even after immune response has done all it can.   


2) I read about garbage collection and mRNA silencing if the natural mRNA is partially degraded (and potentially can make defective proteins). Do these garbage collection and silencing mechanisms apply similarly to the synthetic mRNA in the Pfitzer and Moderna vaccines too?",1606322272.0,2020-11-25 08:37:52

I have to get a few immunizations for a job I'm starting (MMR, possibly flu, and TDAP). I have never been vaccinated in the entirety of my life due to my parents being extremely anti-vax. I lie somewhere in the middle of the vaccination debate, but mostly lean towards them being for the best. It's just hard to leave a mindset you've been ingrained with all your life. Anyway! So I have Hashimoto's and chronic urticaria for unknown reasons.. I randomly get bad allergy flare-ups that cause my throat and skin to swell up. IgE is around 200something off the chart, and thyroid shows to be overreactive. My allergist, when I asked her about getting introduced to vaccines for the first time at almost 30 with all of these issues, said I should be fine, and that she's had other more immunocompromised people get vaccines and they're fine. The thing is, she's never had someone who *also* has never been vaccinated, which is where my concern comes in - since I was never introduced to vaccines growing up and (I assume) my immune system has gotten worse over the years.

I just wanted to know if there's someone who has had a similar experience to me. I go for my first vaccine tomorrow, and I'm extremely concerned/nervous. I fear that my body won't react well and I'll have a severe reaction. Just seeking some reassurance, I suppose! Thanks!",1606309604.0,2020-11-25 05:06:44

About once a week I see someone stumble in here trying to find some way of unblinding themselves from whatever trial they are enrolled in. 

First of all, no one here can tell you and if they say they can they are talking out their ass. 

Secondly, it's just bad practice. You are as much part of the investigative team as any of the researchers. By unblinding yourself you are TAINTING the results and skewing the trial. It muddles your ability to be a neutral reporter, you are no longer reliable. THERE IS A REASON THEY DON'T FUCKING TELL YOU OR THEY'D JUST TELL YOU. 

Just. Fucking. Stop. If you can't handle not knowing until the end (and they can tell you at the conclusion of the trial) THEN STOP WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME AND DROP OUT. Seriously, you are harming the study results and there's plenty of other folk out there who would take your place to volunteer.

PS: I have an MS in clincial research so please ask questions and I'll be happy to answer them in detail. But please, stop asking if you got the placebo or not! They will tell you at the end of the trial if you ask (not when you're done, necessarily, but at the total conclusion of the trial).

I never received these as a teenager as they were fairly new. I had a physical last week and my doctor brought it up but I just played it off like I wasn’t sure if I had them but thought I probably had. I’m terrified of needles and going to an doctors appointment gives me intense anxiety but any that I know could involve shots is 10x worse. 

I’m about to make an obgyn appointment (would be my first) and I know they will most likely bring it up again and I’m assuming might put more emphasis on it. I’m willing to weigh the pros and cons but wanted some advice. 

Pros
-prevents disease 

Cons
- 3 shots
-painful 
- will cause me massive anxiety

I guess I’m just looking on advice for my situation.

I wasn't vaccinated as a child, but I got a Tetanus shot when I was 18 and joined the army. I wanted to know if primary immunization (in infancy) is necessary for full immunity from tetanus or is a standalone booster shot effective on its own? I'm asking because I recently cut myself on a rusty pier in the ocean... I'm 20 now.

I consulted a GP and he said it was fine, but I'm not completely assured honestly. If there is someone here who is knowledgeable about vaccines I'd really like to hear your opinion.

I’m not sexually active and thus probably not prone to HPV. Nonetheless, though, I wanna be safe, and I trust my pediatrician. My mom doesn’t share my trust in doctors. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be vaccinated at all of it weren’t for my dad—my mom is very cautious about vaccines, especially Gardasil. She says that not enough research has been done about it, and talks about it having some sort of adverse neurological effects, though she doesn’t specify as to what kinds, nor does she provide any sort of research to back her claims.

Recently, I was at the doctor’s office and I asked about getting the vaccine. My mom cut me off, saying “no, I’m not comfortable with that.” My doctor proceeded to answer my question anyway—she said that I could get the vaccine in couple of weeks alongside my flu shot, and made it clear that my mom’s consent wasn’t a necessity. 

I’m torn. As much as I love my mom, she’s not exactly a credible source at this point—until recently, she believed that vaccines caused autism. And her remedy for everything is essential oils, even my mental health. She’s tried treating my anxiety with essential oils. (I’m still an anxious mess, but now I smell like lavender. Thanks mom.)  

So now I have to make an educated choice, which involves doing research of my own. This post is part of that, I guess. I don’t feel right about not getting this vaccine. Even if it’s not mandatory, I wanna listen to my doctor. And stuff happens. I might become sexually active at some point soon, or, as morbid as it is, I could be raped. If that happens, I don’t wanna worry about a preventable disease. On the other hand, though, my mom has me kinda nervous. Is there anything to what she’s saying? Is it not a trustworthy vaccine? I’m trying to do my own research but it’s complicated. I’m terrified of anything that has neurological effects and my mom knows this.

My mom doesn't vaccinate me and I have alot of questions about vaccines.,6,imks89,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/imks89/my_mom_doesnt_vaccinate_me_and_i_have_alot_of/,23,"To start off, I am 15 and unvaccinated. I think the last vaccine I got was when I was... Three, I think. 

My mom is against vaccines for me and my siblings. I've asked my dad his stance on it and he basically said that he thinks it's kind of weird to be loading up little babies with all these foreign things but other then that, he pretty much just goes along with what my mom thinks.

I've asked my mom a few times what her stance is. She's told me:

- There was a study done where a man found a connection between autism and a certain vaccine (I can't remember what vaccine she said it was). The guy who did the study found that certain chemicals or something that some kids are born with can be turned on by the vaccine, making some kids who get the vaccine start displaying traits of autism

She said he got all these co-scientists to peer review the article and they agreed and he posted it. She says that the vaccine companies didn't like this and started pressuring his peer reviewers to revoke his study, which they eventually all did. She says his article never said that vaccines cause autism, and that he actually wasn't even studying that.

He was studying a link between kids with a certain gut problem and some enzymes or something and he happened to see the link between the vaccines and the time of the symptoms of autism showing up. He also saw that kids with autism often had a certain gut problem, that also showed up after getting the vaccine.

Sidenote, I've never heard her actually say the words ""Vaccines cause autism"". My younger brother has diagnosed high functioning autism and she has said that he started displaying the symptoms of autism after he got the vaccine.

- She has said that vaccine companies try to downplay the amount of people that actually get hurt or sick from vaccines

- She has said she is not anti-vaccines. If vaccines work for someone and they choose to use them, good for them. But she has done the research and decided that vaccines are not good for our family.

- She has said that because our family has alot of allergies (This is true. Me and my siblings seem to be allergic to everything. Cats, dogs, pollen, peanuts, watermelon, milk, cantaloupe, pineapple, etc), she doesn't feel comfortable injecting us with things that have many different ingredients, some that we could be allergic to

- I have asked her if/when a Covid-19 vaccine comes out, if she will take us to get it. She says she doesn't know but probably not because she doesn't want us to be injected with something that scientists tried to get done as fast as possible (they have reason to try and do it fast because people are dying every day of covid) and probably wouldn't have been in trial for a long time.

- She has said that she believes our bodies are strong enough to handle viruses without vaccines.

- She has said that we don't know the long term effects of vaccines on our bodies because they haven't been around for generations and generations 

- She has said that people vaccinate unnecessarily for alot of things. 

  Chicken pox, for example. When my grandparents were kids and a kid in the neighborhood got chickenpox, they would have chicken pox parties so the other kids would get it as young as possible. You're not going to die from chicken pox. It sucks, yeah, but you don't need vaccines just because something sucks. 

  People also vaccinate for diseases that are rare to get and they most likely won't get, like polio.

I think those are all of her big points she has told me.

Also, and this is kind of my own point, by best friend almost died when she was younger from a certain vaccine. I believe it was an STD or HIV vaccine. She says that it was like the vaccine was trying to come out of her skin. I also know a few other people who have had bad experience with vaccines. If bad side effects are so rare, how is it that I know so many people who have experienced them? 

My mom is a smart lady. She does her research and if she she believes something, it's because she truly does believe it is true. She also loves me and my siblings. I've seen people say that parents who don't vaccinate their kids hate their kids or should be sent to jail. I don't think that's true. My parents love me, I know that with absolute certainty.

I've never really questioned her on things before and if I have, after a bit of research it's clear to me on most things that her conclusion was the correct one. But, this time it's different.

The overwhelming majority of people I have met or read online are pro-vaccines and think people who don't vaccinate are idiots. My mom isn't an idiot, so I know that's not true, but it is confusing when she is in the very small majority of people who don't vaccinate.

I've tried to look up online things about vaccines but I feel like the only things I can find are articles gushing about how good vaccines are and articles ridiculing people who don't vaccinate.

It's also hard for me because no matter what I read, there is this little thought in the back of my head that thinks ""Maby this article about how good vaccines are is actually not true.""

Or

""Maby the vaccine companies try to get only articles published that say vaccines are good, like how in the 80's, cigarette companies tried to get people to only publish stuff that said said cigarettes are healthy and not bad, even though they know that the truth was the opposite of what they claimed.""

I don't know, I'm just really confused and I don't know what is true and what to believe. I want to be independent and find my own way and discover what I believe by looking at the facts, but this is a lot harder then I thought it would be.

I don't know if anyone will respond to this because this is kind of a smaller subreddit, but I really hope someone has some advice",1599270809.0,2020-09-04 18:53:29

No long term understanding of COVID vaccine,17,iegsk4,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/iegsk4/no_long_term_understanding_of_covid_vaccine/,7,"Hi!

I don't identify as anti-vax and I have very little knowledge on the subject but I thought maybe you guys could answer this concern that seems to be appearing a lot lately that I can't help but sympathize with. 

In Australia currently, vaccinations are a hot topic as the government has secured future vaccines for the whole population and wants to take steps to make sure as many people as possible receive it.

According to polls 1/3 of Australians will not take the vaccine and I feel the main concern here for people is the widespread knowledge that vaccines generally take a long time to be approved something like 8-12 years. The general sentiment is that we have don't have an understanding of long terms side effects if there are any.

People here are also comparing the Russian vaccine to the one the government has secured, with wide media ridicule of the Russian vaccine because of lack of testing, yet the government is suggesting they want the vaccine available by the end of the year. I guess it doesn't take a solid mathematic understanding to realize in that case there would only be a couple of months of extra testing.

So should people be concerned about the longterm health effects of a COVID vaccine?

And what testing are the Russians not doing that are allowing for a media anti russian vaccine sentiment.

Thanks!!",1598124181.0,2020-08-22 12:23:01

Still terribly afraid of vaccines at 14,2,i98ltj,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/i98ltj/still_terribly_afraid_of_vaccines_at_14/,3,"I have been afraid of vaccinations since I was a kid and understood what was happening. That's fine. When I got 4 booster shots at five or six, and then was told I would not have to get any more shots save for the flu shot until I turned 12, I was happy. But still, at least once every few months (it got more prominent the closer I got to 12) I would cry in bed and dread turning twelve. When I did turn twelve and have to get those shots, I had to get six (four to prevent other diseases, like Hepatitis A and stuff like that, the flu shot, and a blood draw). Instead of getting them all around the same time, I managed to fight the doctor to get them stretched out over the course of six months. This procrastination caused a lot more stress on my part, and yes, a lot more night crying. Every few days before a flu shot I cry for a few night in anticipation. Now, I am getting a follow up shot to one that I got a year ago (tomorrow), and since that one was particularly painful, I am panicking (as always). The 'buzzy bee' just makes it SO MUCH WORSE, not just because I am also afraid of bees, but because of the sensation, and how it is supposed to numb you. I don't want to be numbed. I HATE that sensation. It makes me tense up even more and shake and fiddle around.

That's the thing is that it isn't just the pain of the vaccine that I am afraid of, it is the concept, the fear, the dread, the memories. If I could block out the pain of the shot, I would still dread getting it, I would still cry whilst I was getting it. Sure, it would make it better, but it wouldn't solve the problem, not even close. I feel like if it was in my leg or any other part of my other then that one part of my shoulder, it might be better for me, but for obvious reasons, that's impossible. I just have so many negative memories of shots in that part of my shoulder. Sometimes when someone touches it I'll jump. Once my dad pinched that part of my shoulder playfully and I started crying for no good reason. I also can't watch people get shots. When it is in a movie, I will hid under the blanket. Once, we had to watch one of those videos for health class, and I hid in the bathroom to avoid the assignment.

So yeah... pretty normal for a eight year old, maybe, but the older I get, it seems to be getting worse, and not better. I don't know if it is because I am understanding when I'll get shots more, or if I have more memories associated with it, or more, but I hate it. It has no sign of resolving in the near future. Does anyone else still have this problem? Did it go away? When? How?",1597382537.0,2020-08-13 22:22:17

Most of their priorities with me were custody battles as revenge tokens and someone to do household chores for them. Besides that neglecting things in general due to their lifestyles of drug abuse and alcoholism, neither records being kept nor doctors appointments being followed up on regularly were a priority. 

Now I'm an adult with designs on being a teacher. The school board asked for my immunization records since my school record didn't have them. My mom had no such documentation and I called my pediatrician and he said such things were lost during the move to digital records, since he couldn't find mine either. I called the local health department who reported *some* vaccines, *some other partial* vaccines, and none of others. End result, I don't know how vaccinated I am or am not. But I need to be vaccinated in order to work in the public school system.  So I told my doctor, just give me all the vaccines I should need to do so. He presented a second problem, saying that if I retook one vaccine I already had it would lead to some bad juju. How bad I am not sure. But we don't know if I've had it or not. Also the question remains of exactly which ones I need to be able to present to work for the school system. 

Now where you guys as hopefully enthusiastic hobbies or experts come in. How bad would it be to ""start fresh"" and just tell them to give me everything?  Should I try to navigate and pick and choose with the very loose information I have?  And since my school board nor doctor seem to agree, find a list of needed vaccinations for North Carolina, USA to make the standard. (The school board told me to have my doctor sign a thing saying I was clear, not provide a list, and my doctor said he wouldn't sign it without a list of what was needed, and I just went back and forth between these answers for MONTHS)

Monovalent measles & mumps,1,hwat6h,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/hwat6h/monovalent_measles_mumps/,2,"I run an Autism/speech clinic and one of our families is opposed to the use of vaccines derived from fetal cell lines. She has not allowed her 1 year-old son to receive the MMR vaccine. She wants him to be vaccinated and is not anti-vaxx but has this 

Mother has asked how she can vaccinate her son for measles and mumps separately without the rubella (since Rubella is the only one of the three that was derived using cells from electively terminated fetuses.)

My understanding is most countries (incl. U.S.) only use MMR now - no separate measles or mumps is available - which puts her in a quandary. She is determined to vaccinate her little boy but will only do so if the vaccines are derived from animal cells.

My research indicates there is a To 336 Rubella vaccine that does not use the common fetal cell lines (it uses monkey kidney cell lines I think), but I don’t know where she may be able to find it for administration. 

Questions:

1) What, if any, countries still administer monovalent measles & mumps vaccines? Does anyone have a list I could share with her? 

2) Is it possible to import monovalent measles and mumps vaccines into the U.S.? If not, how could she go about getting them? Could she travel outside the U.S.? Where would she have the best opportunity to do so?

2) Is the To 336 Rubella vaccine available outside of use for research purposes? (I believe this is the one developed in Japan around 1974.) If so, how could she procure it so she could get him vaccinated? Are there countries that administer To 336 for young children?

3) Is the version of Hep A w/animal cell lines available?  (I believe there is a bivalent vaccine with Typhoid but it is contraindicated under 16 years.)

Thanks for any info.

Need help on clarifying the difference between ERIG and a rabies vaccine shot,5,h9jnm6,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/h9jnm6/need_help_on_clarifying_the_difference_between/,6,"I am an animal lover and I was always getting bitten and scratched by cats so I was always being given rabies shots. Years ago, my clinician gave me an ERIG shot saying that it is a long term protection against rabies. Flashforward 2020 and I was doing a little bit of research since I was scheduled for a rabies booster shot (2nd) but I didnt show up because it was my cat that scratched me and I am fairly sure that my cat is not infected with the rabies virus. Aside from that, this nurse who gave me the first rabies shot did not give me tetanus vaccine (which on my experience is always given side to side on my first day of rabies vaccine shot by my other clinician, the one who gave me ERIG) so I was thinking this clinic was not entirely serious about giving me the vaccine, more like just trying to get profit off of unsuspecting patients. 

So what I learned from researching is that the rabies vaccine is the one that is for long term, but it takes seven days for the body to create its own antibody against the virus that is why ERIG or HRIG is given depending on the severity of the case because HRIG/ERIG is fast acting. It does mention needing boosters if you were scratched or bitten by a suspected rabid animal but my point is, my clinician said ERIG is for long term safety against rabies but internet sources doesnt mention anything about this.

Now im starting to think that my clinician lied to me. I do remember the ERIG shot costs so much more than the regular rabies vaccine. 

Or is there something else I do not understand about the ERIG/HRIG?

I have been to 3 other doctors before this and no one ever asked me for this/ check me for immunity. My mother remembers me having chicken pox as a child. 
My question is if this is a mandatory vaccine why is this not part of pre-conception check list? I have been waiting  for my treatments and just recently finding this out has been a bit hard because this means waiting for 2-3 months more. Is it OK to just take one shot? Looking for advice, please no negative comments. I am just upset to be finding this out so late in the process, but I will be taking 2 shots if that's the best thing to do.

Update : I was wrong in saying that I was not checked for varicella during my pre-conception visit.

My mom's a doctor. She says I have gotten 100% all required vaccines as a child. The records are completely lost, no way to get them. 

10 years ago I applied for US green card. Many vaccines are required to pass medical exam that accompanies the application, and I got them all (including all needed boosters), because I couldn't get records of my initial childhood vaccines.

Fast forward 10 years, now I got accepted into nursing school. Again, LOTS of vaccines required. At this point, I've had them all twice, but have zero record (records form Green Card application 10 years ago are also unavailable with no way of getting them). So I will need to get them again. Another option is to do immunity testing, but I don't think my insurance would cover that.

My question is, and I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but is there any danger/harm in getting all those vaccines (MMR, TDAP, Varicella, Hep B and Meningitis) so many times (at least 3 times).",1589885204.0,2020-05-19 03:46:44

Adressing Anti-vaxxer situations and how to respond,3,gfo3ye,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/gfo3ye/adressing_antivaxxer_situations_and_how_to_respond/,9,"Over the years there have been more and more people claiming vaccines are bad, poisonous etc... while these claims are obviously false and easily proven false whats left is a bad taste in everyone mouth because they have unfortunately have had to argue with anti-vaxxers which is always a pain as i can speak from experience. The whole situation of anti-vaxxers for some people has shifted into the family setting where it only taked one misinformed person to spark an argument and thus ruin everyones day. In this reddit post id like to 1. Identify, 2. Adress, 3. Respond to the situations you redditors may face when comign across an Anti-vaxxer.

1. Identify
Most anti-vaxxers we know are missinformed and follow along outrageous conspiracies. Most anti-vaxxers are very open with their beliefs as the topic of vaccine has become and very opinionated and political subject for some and will often strive to prove they are right with their conspiracies without forwarding any actual evidence. Another “form” of anti-vaxxer could be so,eone who may not understand topics such as immunuty and vaccine and how they work thus unfortunately being consumed by false information or the type of anti-vaxxer stated before.

2. Adress
Understanding what kind of anti-vaxxer you are conversing with can be quite helpful and save you some time. I have seen 2 type of anti-vacxer that corrospond with the descriptions given in #1. First type can be described as somebody who is rooted in their way as they follow along their beliefs, these people usually cant be argued with as they are too far cown the rabbit whole to talk to.personally when coming to these people I find its not worth your time to argue with them as when they have been proven wrong on some many occasion they will fall back on saying “its their own veiws and opinions” etc. Secnd type of person you may encounter is somebdy who has the capacity to learn and are generally easy to talk too in anornal fashion, mainly not arguative or combative when discussing the topic. These are the poeple worth talking too.

3. Respond
The 1st type of Anti-vaxxer described above IMO honestly would be just better to dismiss their claims. For me irl I have argued with a person like this so many times and its not worth wasting your breath trying to have a civil discussion with. Appart from that if you wish to respond to thembest to use evidence and common sense as they lack that. 2nd type of Anti-vaxxer are willing to learn and listened to your side, they often are just missinformed with tye subject and most of the time may have the 1st type of anti-vaxxer in their life. In all the ability to listen to and learn is what makes a better person.


While profiling antivaxxers may sound rather off, this is what dictates whats worth wasting your time on. If you feel like disproving somebodies claims go right at it, its pretty fun to watch as they scramble to bring up more garbage. Some may say that dismissing someones anti-vaxxer claims because they are wrong and not allowing their voice is wrong, i can only say this is, why allow a voice from somebody who is not going to be reasonable? Why waste the time? That in itself maybe unreasonable but in that situation who is in the most wrong? You or them?",1588949557.0,2020-05-08 07:52:37

I’ve posted here a while back about the fact that I’m a 20 year old college student with antivaxx parents who was living on his own and planned to finally get vaccinated without their knowledge. 

Unfortunately, now that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit, I am back in my parents’ household where antivaxx talk is at an all time high—just one thing that’s making me go insane and stir crazy. I had planned to talk to the university health center about my situation in order to create some sort of plan to get the shots I’ve been missing out on for 20 years.

But I’ve got to wait a little longer for that. Right now, my lack of knowledge when it comes to vaccines is even more hindering. Of course I want to get the vaccine when it becomes widely available, but can someone who’s never been vaccinated be able to receive the shot without any complications?

I know this question probably sounds really ignorant and stupid, but there is no way I’m going to replace my parents’ homeopathic “remedies” with the vaccine once I go back to campus. I just need you to let me know or give me your best guess as to if there are any risks to an unvaccinated person’s first vaccine being this eventual COVID-19 one.

Mixing Ty21 and Typoid Vi vaccines,1,fwtxkq,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/fwtxkq/mixing_ty21_and_typoid_vi_vaccines/,0,"Hi,

I had the **Typhim Vi** a few months back. Later I read it needs a booster at least every three years with protection in ""the first year after being given (with between 50% and 80% efficacy) and the second year (31% to 76%), but not after that.""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_capsular_polysaccharide_vaccine

The **Ty21a** oral vaccine lasts 5-7 years but  protection is less, but lasts longer. It's a four capsule regime (3 caps in EU but one can just buy another packet of 3 and take the extra capsule to make 4)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty21

I travel lots around India Thailand Malaysia Boreno and across South America for extended lengths.

I would like to take this Ty21a in addition to the Typhim VI. This way I have some protection in the event I cannot find a booster of Typhim Vi.

Can I take the oral vaccine even though I've had the  Typhim Vi vaccine?  Are these contrained or have any counterproductive effect?

We're very PV. I've talked twice to the ped's office. Last Monday, they said they're seeing well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon and to keep our appointment. This morning, the front desk said they're leaving it up to parental discretion. I asked if we could do shots in the car or even just run in, get them, and leave. She said no and that we would have to do the whole well visit or we couldn't get shots. She gave us the option of delaying the appointment for a week. My husband and I have a few concerns and would REALLY love some input here. 
1. If we delay for a week and things get worse, we definitely won't want to take her in. Then who knows how long the delay will be. I know there are risks with a delay, especially for delaying MMR. Would this mean all her future shots would be on a delayed schedule?
2. She's old enough for flu shot now, and this would mean probably no flu shot until at least autumn.
3. I really don't trust the sanitation at this office. She was also my ped, and she's personally great. Her office staff, though, is below par. (As a former EMT, I think the one office location is gross. The other one looks nice, but it's the same employees.)
4. Biggest reason for posting a question that so many people are already asking is that our daughter has laryngomalacia. It's an airway defect that causes softening of the tissues of the larynx above the vocal cords. The laryngeal structure is malformed and floppy, causing the tissues to fall over the airway opening and partially block it. It caused her to have apnea multiple times during her first few months, but it seems that has gotten a lot better. However, it can be quite dangerous for her to catch a respiratory illness. I don't know if it's riskier for her to delay shots or to potentially be exposed to COVID-19 because of this.

I see the argument a lot from anti-vaxxers like “how can my kid be a threat to yours if yours has been vaccinated and mine doesn’t have ___ sickness?” or “explain his exactly my kid spread a disease they don’t have?” And I always want to better understand the answer- I understand herd immunity generally speaking, but don’t *quite* understand who is at risk by allowing unvaccinated children into schools, etc. Is it just in their own (unvaccinated) kid’s interest and that’s why it’s required?

My mom swears I was three months old and just knew what was happening. She'd hoped it go away by age 5, then 10, then 15... it didn't. However, I've learned to cope with it (yay therapy!). I'm now 21F and have been going to all of my regularly scheduled appointments for the last 2 or 3 years. 

Anyway, as my 22nd birthday approaches my PCP let me know I'm due for all my 10 year boosters. This includes tetanus and a few others. I had my titer done yesterday and I need an MMR booster, too. I recently just finished my Gardisil series of 3 shots and they freaking hurttttttt. Ran a fever and my arm hurt for 5 days. So, my question to you guys is this...

Has anyone had an MMR booster? What was your experience? Fever afterwards or any rash formation?

And for tetanus, is it really as bad as everyone says!? I'll be honest, the HPV shot retraumatized me a bit. It hurt going in, made my whole arm cramp up for an hour afterwards, and hurt for days to lift my arm even to shoulder level. Shared tetanus vaccine experiences will be greatly appreciated.

I'd like to note that I am 100% absolutely going to get all of my vaccines! My phobia doesn't keep me from keeping myself/others protected and healthy. Just trying to prepare as I work two jobs and am also a full time student. Mentally preparing and hearing others experiences helps my anxiety about it all, too. Also may be important to note that I do spike a fever after getting my flu shot each year. Vaccines in general give me fevers, the severity varies though. Anyway, please share your experiences!

After some discussion with my doc, and because my childhood antibodies had waned and because of my age, we agreed to start vaccinating. 
I still have excellent titers for HebA HepB MMR from vaccines administered decades earlier. I had childhood chickenpox.

    Taken:
    Nov 2019: Boostrix-IPV 
    Nov 2019: MenB (Trumemba)
    Nov 2019: Rabipur * 2
    Dec 2019: Boostrix, MenACWY (Nimenrix)
    Dec 2019: Rabipur *1
    Jan 2020: Typhoid (Tyrix Vi)
    Feb 2020: DTaP-Hib-IPV-HBV (Infanrix Hexa)  ( yes, we know it's a peadicatic dose, but perfectly safe for adults. The capital DT in DTaP indicates more antibodies than the Td in Tdap)
    Feb 2020: PCV13 (Prevnar 13)

    Proposed boosters
    May 2020: ACT-Hib  (Hib)
    Jul 2020: MenB booster (Trumemba)
    Dec 2020: Boostrix (Tdap)
    Feb 2021: PCV23 (Prevnar 23)
    Feb 2023: Typhoid booster (Tyrix Vi)


Is the scheduling for the DTap+Tdap ok for best immune response?
&nbsp;

Is the scheduling for Hib good for best immune response? Should I add a third or forth ACT-Hib booster?  

&nbsp;

Of course, I know I could just have a blood test and check :)

Many thanks,GK

I'm travelling to The Philippines in mid March, and I went to a travel clinic and got the typhoid oral medication, but I'm a little confused about the Hep A vaccine. 

Isn't Hep A&B administered when you are a kid as a part of routine kid vaccinations? (Much like MMR and Polio)",1582706522.0,2020-02-26 00:42:02

"I believe in vaccines, but still get stressed",18,f8nefk,VACCINES,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/f8nefk/i_believe_in_vaccines_but_still_get_stressed/,3,"Let me start by saying that everyone in my family is fully vaccinated and we are following the recommended schedule for our first child, who is now a year old. 

I firmly believe in vaccines and the fact that they do, have, and will continue to save lives. 

The only thing that makes me nervous about them is I’m about to have another baby, and I have serious anxiety regarding getting him vaccinated on schedule. I don’t know why, other than watching my first son get his shots is so traumatic for me. 

My family, due to being of Asian descent, are all carriers of Hep B. So, the baby needs an extra shot at birth, and has to get blood drawn at 9 months to see if they worked and they are NOT a carrier. My first son, the person drawing his blood did terrible and I literally wept from him screaming in pain. I think this is what’s stressing me out the most. Vaccines work, I know they do. 

But why am I so scared this second time around?",1582555991.0,2020-02-24 06:53:11
