"I still upvoted this. ( it's good to hear!)

My 2 Pfizer shots weren't as smooth,  but it's all behind me...",nqpd2o,2021-06-03 00:13:40
Glad to hear it went okay for you!,nqpd2o,2021-06-02 18:35:36
"I chose J&J too. And I am glad I made the right choice. I had no side effects. To be fair to moderna though, my father is fully vaccinated with moderna and he said he also had no side effects. He tested positive for covid before he got vaccinated He is also in his 80s.",nqpd2o,2021-06-02 22:44:23

"J&J gang! I‚Äôve been waiting to post my experience because I wanted to see what happened over time, but I‚Äôm three months out. No big side effects except what felt like a slight hangover the next day, and a minor rash two weeks after my shot (which went away after a couple days and is consistent with the times
I‚Äôve gotten flu shots). All in all I‚Äôd say it was pretty boring. My cell phone reception still sucks and all I have out of it is a new found appreciation for Clippy.",nqpd2o,2021-06-03 05:01:50
"No, these are exactly the kind of posts that need upvotes. 

If upvotes were proportional to the people experiencing these outcomes in the real world, yours would have several hundred thousand and most on this sub would have 1.",nqpd2o,2021-06-02 17:12:15
I upvoted you just because you said not to.,nqpd2o,2021-06-03 03:01:16
"Thank you for this! I got my J&J yesterday morning, went for a fairly intense hike, drank lots of water and some cold pressed juices, visited with a friend, completed an assignment for class - a normal day for me. I expected as much since I've never had any sort of reaction to anything ever, so I was shocked when I started feeling nauseated, dizzy, feverish, and having bodyaches around 9pm. I took a hot bath, ibuprofen, and slept for ten hours. I woke up today feeling like I'd been hit by a truck, so I called in sick to work this morning, and I've spent the day drinking water, stretching, napping, drinking more water, and just taking it easy. Reading that you were at 100% at day three makes me feel a LOT better about things!",nqpd2o,2021-06-03 05:46:42

"Same. J&J a couple of months ago, nothing major to report. One and done, and the only thing I have had is every once in awhile the injection site aches. I thought it was mental, but it's not. No regrets. Wife had Pfizer and pregnant, zero side effects. We both had the Rona in Feb 2020.",nqpd2o,2021-06-03 05:24:25
"I had 100+ fever next day after each Pfizer shot. Both lasted one day though and I was fine afterward. On the other hand, my wife had no side affects after each shot.",nqpd2o,2021-06-03 02:45:20
"Aw that‚Äôs cute. You‚Äôre right.. Let‚Äôs just discredit all the people who are suffering short- and long-term adverse reactions and only give credence to the ones that feel good to read about (confirmation bias).

"Hi, I had a similar reaction from the first shot (everything you described minus the palpitations/heart pounding) and am wondering if you had any side effects from the first dose? Or if this only showed up after the second shot of Pfizer? I have only had one dose so far & am not getting my second until the end of July. My symptoms have taken about 8 weeks to go away from the first shot & they haven't gone away completely. I'll be finally speaking with my family doctor tomorrow & will be requesting a ton of testing.",nqmgv2,2021-06-02 18:34:06
Sorry u are feeling like this and for those of us who have had long term side effects post vaccine we know u are not making it up.

"Wishing you the best and hopefully you get some answers! Had a heart scare years ago and being alone during that time was terrifying, so I know what that stress is like and it compounding with not being able to sleep. It's not much but work as much as you can to relax and destress like with meditation.

"I believe you are having issues post vax. I am sorry you are basically going through hell. I am going to make some suggestions. These in no way mean I dont believe you. It means I care and want you to feel better. And if you don't want to hear what I have to say, thats up to you. I am not trying to discredit your concerns. You know how sometimes when you are looking for something in the cupboard and it takes someone else to find it because you are influenced by what you think  looks like and where you thought the thing is you are looking for?

Typically if they find something concerning on the holter monitor they get ahold of you pretty quick.

**Drink at least 40 oz of plain ole water daily**. Water is magic medicine. Get your potassium, magnesium and Vit D levels tested. If after all the simple things don't help you may want to have your spinal fluid tested.

**Stop taking ibuprofen for a week**. The side effects cover most of what you are having trouble with. Also, you are taking turmeric which means you are overdosing by taking 2 anti inflammatories and turmeric can interact with ibuprofen and cause internal bleeding. Important to note is that **too much fish oil can cause insomnia**. You want to make sure its a fish oil tested to be free from mercury as well.

**Ibuprofen has a long list of side effects.** I am aware of ibuprofen uncommon side effects because I cant take even one dose without side effects and for me it also causes intense anxiety the more days I take it even just one 400 mg dose a day. On top of all that it also raises my blood pressure. I am not allergic to it. I was taking it regularly and had no idea the funk I was living was caused by ibuprofen.

**IBUPROFEN SIDE EFFECTS...** all these potential side effects and millions take it daily. Excuse the overuse of asterisks. Those symptoms were highlighted as correlating to your symptoms and the editor decided to add asterisks instead. lol

    **chest pain/tightness**  
    **shortness of breath**  
    **weakness in one part or side of the body**  
    slurred speech.  
    unexplained weight gain  
    swelling of the abdomen, feet, ankles, or lower legs  
    fever  
    allergic reaction  
    hoarseness  
    excessive tiredness  
    **pain in the upper right part of the stomach (stomach pain can also feel like a heart attack)**  
    nausea  
    loss of appetite  
    yellowing of the skin or eyes  
    **flu-like symptoms**  
    pale skin  
    **fast heartbeat**  
    cloudy, discolored or bloody urine  
    **back pain**  
    difficult or painful urination  
    **blurred vision, changes in color vision or other vision problems**  
    red or painful eyes  
    stiff neck  
    headache  
    **confusion**  
    aggression  
    Constipation, diarrhea, or upset stoma  
    **Dizziness or headache**  
    Mild nausea, vomiting, gas, stomach pain or heartburn  
    Mild rash or itching skin  
    Ringing in ears  

This may also be anxiety. Read some of the posts and symptoms of people that had severe anxiety after their vaccine. Anxiety is a sneaky thing and likes to make you feel like you are dying and then it becomes perpetual. At the very least it can cause sleeplessness. Trust me, I could write a novel on that problem.

I worked in virology research and pharmaceutical manufacturing in the 80s-90s. I had taken ibuprofen for many years without issue.  After I figured out my issues with ibuprofen and told my Dr, I realized how much they rely on pharmacists to know it all. You would think the software they enter our symptoms and meds and supplements would trigger a correlation between potential side effects and physical complaints. Nope",nqmgv2,2021-06-03 04:55:45

"I agree. Not saying all of your symptoms are being caused by anxiety, I‚Äôm not a doctor so obviously follow the advice of your doctor, but as someone who has struggled with anxiety, I have been surprised in the past at how many physical symptoms anxiety can cause, and has caused for me (and then of course, anxiety over the anxiety-induced physical health problems causes more anxiety, which can cause more health problems and you end up with this horrible vicious circle).

For example, I used to suffer from severe gastrointestinal discomfort and pain every day, to the point where I thought I probably had Crohns, but I found that with treatment and therapy for my anxiety (which was quite bad back then), the symptoms went away.

Might be worth seeing if any of your symptoms get better by logging off Reddit and any other health-related forums you use for a while and trying to focus on other things as much as you can for a bit to try to bring the anxiety down, which would also help doctors diagnose any non-anxiety induced issues better.

"Yes, I would bring it up. It‚Äôs a bogus rule, just imo. Positive antibody or t-cell test should equal vaccine card. Plenty of people are catching covid from fully vaccinated people too, so the whole thing is kind of a joke. 

Until cases are super low, or we have a sterilizing vaccine or a medication that stops transmission, the the virus will continue to spread and mutate. There are still plenty of people who cannot get vaccinated (children under 12). And also plenty of people who will not mount an adequate antibody response to the vaccine and can still get sick...there are breakthrough cases.

">Positive for antibodies as well.

When were you last tested? July is almost a year ago.

>I‚Äôve had every other vaccine required and recommended, but the constant political discourse about it makes me nervous.

That's the point, *to make you nervous*.  It's a misinformation campaign. Don't listen to it, listen to experts and public health agencies.

>. My workplace specified that it‚Äôs only if you‚Äôve had the vaccine, but I‚Äôm wondering if it would make sense for me to bring up the fact that I‚Äôve had and survived Covid.

I mean, you can, but they'll probably shoot you down.

>From what I understand, having Covid gives you and even better immunity than the vaccine

There is no evidence for that.  Evidence actually says the opposite:  https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/difference-between-natural-infection-vaccine-immunity/103-1473485c-4f30-4160-b597-3a7e0f2b584b",nqzple,2021-06-03 00:54:45
"Okay wow, the antivaxxers are out in droves today. (not talking about you OP, just some of the commenters)

Look, the reason why the two shot vaccines have high efficacy is because the second shot is a booster of sorts. The first shot introduces your body to what it needs to learn to fight, and then the second vaccine reactivates your immune system to become stronger. This is why people who previously had covid usually have a stronger reaction to their first vaccine and then negligible to the second (because the first shot was their booster and by the second shot their body‚Äôs just like ‚Äúhold my beer, I‚Äôve got this‚Äù). Don‚Äôt listen to the politicians, listen to the scientists.

This is going to be very important in the coming months, as there are new covid variants that do a decent job at getting around our collective ‚Äúimmunities‚Äù. The more robust immune system response, the better possibility of you being able to fight off the new variants.

Now what I‚Äôve gathered from your responses to others, it sounds like you have to upload a vaccination card to get the authorization to work unmasked. You can certainly try talking to your work about you having covid prior, and the ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù you got from that, but honestly I wouldn‚Äôt risk it because they have a very clear requirement and breakthrough cases are more common than people would care to admit. Also please don‚Äôt try and order any of those fake vaccination cards. You *will* be found out, and while I don‚Äôt know what your job‚Äôs policies are, I don‚Äôt think it would end very well.

My recommendation would be to have a conversation with your primary doctor, explain to them your situation, and because of your previous infection you will likely only have to have one shot to qualify. Bam, there‚Äôs your vaccination card. 

Do remember this is my personal recommendation. You‚Äôre free to pursue whichever path you prefer. Just remember that it‚Äôs important to carefully weigh the pros and cons of every possible option, and choose your battles wisely. Good luck, op.",nqzple,2021-06-03 06:11:06
"Having covid and then getting the vaccine gives you better immunity than the vaccine alone. I don't know where you heard that having covid only gives you better immunity. 

Get over it and get the vaccine.",nqzple,2021-06-03 04:46:56
"You make sense.  You have the antibodies,  ergo you‚Äôre way more protected.  Show them proof of your covid antibodies.  They wouldn‚Äôt make sense if they insisted you get vaccinated because you already have the antibodies.",nqzple,2021-06-03 03:46:41
Antibodies don‚Äôt last very long and the vaccine gives stronger immunity than having covid. You need to wear a mask or get the vaccine.,nqzple,2021-06-03 05:29:19
I think I should but I feel like I already know what the answer would be sadly. I don‚Äôt understand why having actual infection is so discounted. If you can‚Äôt prove it why wouldn‚Äôt it count?,nqzple,2021-06-03 03:18:48
"It‚Äôs not just me, I would love if anyone who had Covid didn‚Äôt have to wear it! But that‚Äôs not the rule. They specifically said vaccinated. Antibodies would only show up around 90 days, same if you would have the vaccine. The whole point is that your body remembers the infection to prevent serious infection in the future.",nqzple,2021-06-03 03:20:46
"Stop parroting back extremely outdated and incorrect information.  We aren't in April 2020, the idea that immunity lasts 90 days has long been disproven. The evidence now overwhelmingly shows that natural immunity is long lasting and effective. Reinfection is very rare, but can occur, as can vaccine breakthrough cases, which are also rare.

Not to mention the indisputable fact that none of the vaccine trials established efficacy for people who were previously infected. Public health messaging is not always in line with personal health decisions. This is one of those examples. 

To OP, I would just not wear your mask if you don't want to, and not bring up the issue one way or another. You have immunity, you are not acting irresponsibly, there is no established medical reason for you to get vaccinated at this point.

Asking for permission is a guaranteed fail because you are not dealing with an independent decision maker who can make a rational compromise, you are dealing with a corporate rule that is what it is. CDC says vaccinated people, so corporaterule says vaccinated people, you're not going to find any nuance.",nqzple,2021-06-03 03:50:13

"You‚Äôre telling OP to lie to their boss, and if they get caught they‚Äôll very likely get fired. In the middle of a pandemic.",nqzple,2021-06-03 06:21:16
"Yes, around 3 months after I was initially infected. Antibodies wouldn‚Äôt show up anymore, the body does not work that way. Your body still remember the infection and will understand better how to react if you‚Äôre infected again.

I don‚Äôt want to be pressured either way, to get vaccinated or not, that‚Äôs what I mean when I say political discourse. The second you say you don‚Äôt want it you‚Äôre labeled an anti-vaxxer, but if you do get it, people tell you you‚Äôll be infertile. I honestly don‚Äôt feel comfortable either way. I‚Äôve had Covid, I was fortunate enough to be fine, and I feel like I have the option to act just as any other vaccinated person does.

Likewise, in lots of other cases, actual infection provides stronger immunity than vaccines, that‚Äôs just a fact. Flu vaccine is a perfect example. However, you run the risk of serious illness. In my case, I didn‚Äôt have a choice, I got Covid, was fine, and that was the end of it. Article explaining that a bit is here: https://www.kqed.org/stateofhealth/152601/better-immunity-from-flu-vaccine-or-flu-itself

Either way, not anywhere near enough research has been conducted to say anything for certain.",nqzple,2021-06-03 03:17:51
"It makes sense to me that you would have a stronger immunity if you had Covid and the vaccine. Recent, albeit underdeveloped, studies have shown that. But immunity with the vaccine vs. just having Covid are probably pretty close. That‚Äôs where my thought process was in mentioning that. I just don‚Äôt really understand why me having Covid wouldn‚Äôt count and the vaccine does when the immunity is similar.

Edit: spelling",nqzple,2021-06-03 05:35:50
not sure if serious,nqzple,2021-06-03 09:52:33

"You‚Äôre right, don‚Äôt doubt your conclusion. 

Your risk is extremely low with the known information, adding in an experimental medical therapy would be foolish.

Do not submit to coercion.",nqzple,2021-06-03 05:19:39
"OP the flu is complicated, just like covid. The flu virus is actually many different viruses that mutate rapidly, that‚Äôs why we have new vaccines every year and rapid tests that test for Influenza A and B. Covid isn‚Äôt very different. It‚Äôs already mutated many times to become more virulent, which means we‚Äôll probably have to start treating it like the flu and getting boosters every year. Yes the base vaccine (or infection) will provide some level of immunity to the virus and its variants, but if you refuse the booster your immune system will become ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù to the newer, stronger variants as time goes by. Does this make sense?",nqzple,2021-06-03 06:29:11
"The reason for the push for the vaccine is because it's a mechanism to trick your body into believing you have a high viral load of the virus (which is the distinction of severity and ability to transmit) that is pretty uniform for everyone getting the vaccine. This means that it becomes more controllable with boosters, etc., and becomes a lesser and lesser issue with fewer possibilities of variants with more people vaccinated than not. 

Unless your viral load was specifically tested when you were infected, there's not really a way to measure that viral load, and therefore no real way to predict the efficacy of antibodies from person to person who had covid but remains unvaccinated. 

One of the latest studies I saw (I think it was major news last week, or the week prior) was that there is growing evidence that prior covid infection + vaccination could give you immunity for life. I mean, that's not a bad thing, and the bonus is you can go without your mask at work and a lot of other places with a clear conscience.",nqzple,2021-06-03 05:55:45
"Right, but vaccine or not, it still wouldn‚Äôt last forever. You can still contract and spread Covid after having the vaccine. Same with if you had Covid. I guess why I‚Äôm confused is it‚Äôs essentially the same thing, but having the actual infection doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs vaccine or bust.",nqzple,2021-06-03 03:22:32
Neither does the vaccine immunity,nqzple,2021-06-03 04:51:36
Ah okay. I mean I think the reasonable thing for them to do is ask for an antibodies test to see if the levels are good. The goal would be that it would still be high enough to match everyone you are around. But reasonable isn‚Äôt always what happens.,nqzple,2021-06-03 03:24:23
"Evidence suggests natural immunity does last your entire lifetime. We have data from sars Cov 1 patients having immunity 20 years later and patients of Spanish flu with immunity at approximately 100 years old. The immunity information is stored and antibodies created only when needed.

Natural immunity is absolutely better.",nqzple,2021-06-03 05:10:59
"It is based on cdc recommendations.  Currently, they are only counting vaccine as counting as safe to not wear mask.  
I work in healthcare and it does not seem political to me, it seems like people want to make it political. 
It‚Äôs mostly based on data that shows lower risk fir those who have been vaccinated.
We don‚Äôt know much.  We don‚Äôt know how long immunity lasts, we don‚Äôt know that infection is better immunity than vaccination.  
There are studies that show both, I believe.  The frequency of new cases is coming down.
If you don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine you can wait or not get it, but fear to get it because of politics is not logical.  If you don‚Äôt get vaccinated, wear a mask around people outside your home circle until we are told that there is evidence you don‚Äôt need to or that the numbers are low enough that we can stop.
I‚Äôve been sick and vaccinated and will wear a mask every time I‚Äôm interacting with others in an environment where we are told to wear a mask. (At work, in the grocery store.)
Because I‚Äôm a sheep?  Sure, but so are those who don‚Äôt wear a mask, we are just in different herds.  
Is it inconvenient? Sure sometimes it‚Äôs a little sweaty under the mask.  
It‚Äôs a whole lot more convenient than working with someone on a ventilator or trying to tell a parent when their kid might get out of the hospital.  
Those events are rare but they are very real!",nqzple,2021-06-03 06:40:10
"No, it doesn‚Äôt. But if her immunity was from last year it could not be as strong.",nqzple,2021-06-03 04:59:33

I am now 5 days late for my first full cycle after the second dose of Pfizer. I am NEVER late, like not once since I started menstruating have I been late more than a day, not even when I‚Äôve been stressed or really sick. I‚Äôve been spotting since last night and have been cramping/bloated, but no period. It feels like it‚Äôs going to be REALLY bad when it comes though. I‚Äôm so pissed because I regularly track my periods and planned out a mini vacation for this weekend and I guarantee you it‚Äôll start then just because it can lol.

But...my cycle has been off since the pandemic started and my daily habits (sleeping, eating, exercise) started getting all wonky, and it's been a pretty regular occurrence for me to have a 20-something day cycle followed by a 40-something day cycle maybe 3 or 4 times a year bc of this.

I'm sorry you are going through this. I also started getting on and off itching but just thought it was the weather. I developed tinnitus and headaches/head pressure and a side of eye floaters...yay. I had eye floaters in my left eye now also in my right. I guess it's from the inflammation. I hope it settles down but from what I read these are permanent with no way of fixing it. More depression for me...ugh,nqscs7,2021-06-03 01:12:37

I've seen a lot of people mention tinnitus. I haven't had that but have had a ton of headaches also! I just wonder if some of us react more strongly to the vaccine for some reason. Prayers that you feel better soon!,nqscs7,2021-06-03 01:41:12
"My (guesswork) theory is that being exposed to the spike protein is likely to send your immune system into overdrive. For some people this is on the first exposure, for some people the second exposure (whether from covid or the vaccine). But the pattern seems to be that being exposed again after the bad reaction calms things down, so I'd give it a go personally. I hope you feel better soon either way!

Btw conspiracy theory = believing there's a 'secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.', so be mindful of the term in case people put you down as crazy when you're simply vaccine hesitant!",nqscs7,2021-06-03 08:32:21

Then beyond that I have some increases in heart rate, other symptoms, which are more manageable. But I have really bad brain fog (for lack of a better word) and just feel out of it. Its really scary!

We must have some auto immune response that others don‚Äôt get. My mom had zero symptoms on the first and second dose and has sickle cell anemia. My sister had a massive amount of headaches on her second dose and went away after 2 weeks. I thought my mom with her being high risk would get the worst but it ended up being me who has no health issues getting it the worst. I hope you have a speedy recovery. I‚Äôm thrilled to be vaccinated but no way am I doing this again with Pfizer or Moderna (unless they find a better method to avoid these side effects). I will wait for an old fashioned dose to be available as a booster.,nqscs7,2021-06-03 02:19:05
"Yea I haven't found the trigger yet either. I had triggers from before the vaccine but post vaccine have not identified what triggers these new types of episodes. Maybe there isn't a trigger and it's just the inflammation ramping up at random times. I have had a thought about trying to identify the early warning signs. Yesterday it was the fatigue that hit me first, followed by all the other stuff. But if there's tasks that needs doing then you can't really just stop and let it pass unfortunately. And I agree it's not much comfort that it isn't life threatening. It's still very difficult to deal with.",nqscs7,2021-06-03 01:06:23
"Yes! The fatigue seems to be a thing for me too. Its if I don't eat, or eat a little too much. The severe spells come out of the blue. Sometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes during the day. Ugh.",nqscs7,2021-06-03 01:30:40
"I think mine is a mix, there is sometimes some warning, like fatigue, followed by the other symptoms. But also sometimes it's been pretty sudden, like the body just suddenly flicks a switch. 

But if I look then over stimulation is often a precipitating factor. However it's hard not to get overstimulated in today's world when the autonomic system is malfunctioning. And what comes up must come down. 

I have had to increase my calories, proteins, fluids and electrolytes all noticeably following this vaccine to get my body to try cope. It hasn't stopped the spells but I feel it has some effect. 

None of what's happened to us is a formally documented side effect of the covid19 vaccine. But coming here and seeing similar experiences to my own, it helps me cope better with it mentally.",nqscs7,2021-06-03 02:06:12

"So this vaccine was being tested even with the variants around, unlike the others. Also there is less reported side effects.

EDIT: grammar",nqs2s4,2021-06-03 00:26:51
"Well I specifically chose the shitty vaccine. I first went to a grocery store near me. They don't have J&J. just one of the rna vaccine, So i have to drive further to the one where I got J&J. Major shocker pfizer is available on that place where I got vaccinated.

I chose J&J coz it's one and done. They use adenovirus used in vaccines since the 70s. And they did say 100% prevent death and hospitalization with J&J.

For me rna vaccines are experimental I don't care if its more effective than J&J. i don't want to be their guinea pig. LOL.",nqs2s4,2021-06-02 22:53:01
"One reason J&J efficiency is lower is their clinical trials were conducted in South Africa where the South African variant is. Pfizer and moderna clinical trial were before those variants. They also have decreased effectiveness ~75% for South African variant. Even if you got a breakthrough case since you are young (and assuming no preconditions such as obesity) and vaccinated it would most likely be a very mild or asymptotic case. I could be wrong but I think only a Yankees coach had symptoms and the players were asymptomatic. As for boosters that really is still tbd for all vaccines. It really depends on how long immunity is lasting, still provides protection against any new variants, and if covid is even still widespread enough to justify another mass vaccination effort. These current vaccines may be enough to achieve herd immunity.",nqs2s4,2021-06-02 20:29:48

Everyone is different. My first dose I still had tinnitus while getting my second. Now I have higher level of tinnitus and eye floaters in my right eye almost a week later.

"I am no smarter than you, just an average person.

This article does seem to confirm what I have pieced together from the available literature I‚Äôve read on the spike protein.

The vaccine contains code for the full length spike protein.. which does find its way to the bloodstream.

The deltoid muscle is choice for vaccines because of its vascularity. 

The positive about the vaccine is there won‚Äôt be any replication.

The spike protein itself though is essentially harmful just as this article suggests.",nqynzk,2021-06-03 00:43:55
If spike protein is that dangerous then it is even more important to get vaccinated as covid virus will replicate itself so you have virus replicating with your cells on top of spike protein circulating in blood stream.,nqynzk,2021-06-03 00:12:19

To create spike proteins, the mRNA needs to be transcribed, which happens inside cells. The assumption in the article is that spike proteins would escape the cells and circulate freely, but this does not seem to be the case.

Look at the big picture. No one here can argue that covid poses a meaningful risk to a fit, healthy 31yr old with no preexisting conditions because the data is overwhelmingly clear that it just doesn't.  

Of course some young people have gotten seriously sick and some have died and the risk is absolutely not zero, but in what world other than covid is zero risk the metric by which we make decisions?

Just as people on this subreddit can create an anecdotally driven skewed perception of the vaccine risks, the same is true for the insane onslaught of fear porn and misinformation that has been force fed to everyone for the past year and a half. 

Yes covid is a serious disease, but the seriousness varies drastically across different population groups. And yet people still act as if it poses grave risk to anyone and everyone just the same. The data just completely disproves that at this point.  Look at kids for example, they are something like 40x more likely to die in a car accident than from covid, and yet the people who don't think twice about having their kids ride in a car every day are the same ones fearing for the lives of their unvaccinated children because they've seen stories about kids dying and suffering from severe inflammatory disease. If you fed them story after story after story of kids being killed in car accidents would they react the same when the totality of the data paints a completely different picture?  Influenza is also far more deadly to children than covid, that's just a fact, and yet no one fears letting their child go without a flu shot. I don't know what it is, but for some reason some people have been deranged with a ""zero risk is the only acceptable risk"" only with respect to covid.

Going back to OP, your short term risk from the vaccine is almost certainly less than your short term risk from covid, but the absolute risk reduction is minuscule, like way less than 1%. You can make a rational argument either way.",nqyjcz,2021-06-03 01:12:19
"‚ÄúI have a good immune system‚Äù person here. Before December 2019 (when it was definitely in California before anyone knew) I hadn‚Äôt been sick with so much as a cold in 3 years and I have 6 children (which as we know, children are vile little cesspools in flu season)....I got COVID. A good immune system is only good until that split second it‚Äôs not. Get the vaccine. I promise you it‚Äôs better than catching it, it was hell",nqyjcz,2021-06-03 07:14:14
"It's extremely important for younger people to get vaccinated (especially if they haven't already had COVID) because vaccines don't protect against infection, hospitalization or death 100% and the efficacy varies by demographic and individual's age and health status (immunocompromised or co-morbidities that leave them vulnerable to severe infection).  You, as a young and healthy person getting the vaccine, will help ensure that, if you do get infected (which it's extremely likely that you eventually will since COVID isn't going anywhere for at least a few years), you will be less likely to pass it on to others who are more vulnerable due to age or health status.

Also, while children typically don't experience severe illness from COVID, they can still catch it and get sick (small minority get very sick and die).  Those under the age of 12 aren't able to be vaccinated yet which means that, unfortunately, a small number of kids WILL get severely sick and potentially even die due to complications caused by COVID infection.  Since this is very much avoidable by vaccinating everyone who is eligible, I (and the majority of scientists and doctors) believe it's unethical for someone to forgo getting vaccinated due to the fact that they are young and healthy.

That's my perspective on that ""I don't need the vaccine because I have a good immune system"" argument - hope it helps you in making a decision!

EDIT: Those of you so eagerly downvoting my response and personal perspective - I invite you to actually engage in a conversation with me and let me know why you're offended by what I've written, thanks!",nqyjcz,2021-06-02 23:56:18
"If you have a healthy immune system, then you should do well with the vaccine. It seems more vulnerable people with pre-existing immune system issues are the ones that don‚Äôt do well with it. I‚Äôm in a CFS/ME group and the incidences of people doing poorly with the vaccine seems much much higher in that group than in the general population. There‚Äôs some immune system dysfunction and mcas in this disorder already. In a perfect world, all the people with healthy immune systems would get the vaccine so people who are already really sick don‚Äôt have to. My mil who just went into remission from cancer and had chemo last year had a horrible time with the vaccine, and I‚Äôm sure would have with covid as well. Whereas my mother who never gets sick or catches viruses had no side effects to the vaccine.",nqyjcz,2021-06-03 02:38:55

"having a strong immune system will very likely kill you (or severely disable you) if you get a severe case of covid, because the cytokine storm that‚Äôs become strongly associated with the disease gets stronger the more robust your immune system is.

"I think there's definitely a good argument that for OP, in the short term he would be making a rational decision to get vaccinated. Long term risks of both covid and the vaccines are unknown, so people will weigh each differently. Some feel more comfortable with the vaccine, some don't. No one wants to talk about it, but there are still a lot of unknowns with the vaccine. For example, a study just came out of Germany establishing for the first time that these vaccines are not just triggering an adaptive immune response to this virus, but they are broadly reprogramming the entire innate immune system with implications that are to be determined. Meaning, the vaccine isnt just creating a response against covid, its also altering how the immune system responds to other viruses/bacteria/fungi/etc. On the other hand, will covid end up causing some unknown problem in the future, like how varicella can later cause shingles?  Unlikely but no one knows yet.  On that level, I certainly trust the millions of years of evolution that have created my immune system over a medical intervention with TBD effects, but some people may feel otherwise.

But I disagree that vaccination is necessary for everyone. For example, a young person who already had covid: if this person gets vaccinated, they are taking on all of the risk for likely no benefit whatsoever(or, arguably at best an absolutely minuscule risk reduction). That makes no sense at all.  Plus, herd immunity can be attained through various means, it's not just all vaccination.  Naturally attained immunity has now been shown to be very good and durable. Yes, there are reinfections, but there are also vaccine breakthrough cases, both of which are rare...again, the exception doesnt make the rule.",nqyjcz,2021-06-03 02:07:58
"I agree that if a young person has already had COVID, they don't need to be vaccinated.  They should have an actual clinical diagnosis, though, not an ""I'm pretty sure I had it!"" kind of thing.

I took a look at that study you mentioned and they did mention that the MMR vaccine also reprograms the innate immune system and I think it's safe to assume that most people in the world receive that vaccine at a very young age and the vast majority of us are doing just fine, especially since we don't catch measles, mumps or rubella anymore!

While further research is well-warranted, they did also mention that the number of volunteers in the study was relatively small and they were all middle-aged, healthy and of Western European ancestry.  That definitely leaves me wanting a much more expansive study!

Their conclusion sounds very reasonable and isn't alarming to me so I'd have to say that we disagree as to whether it's best to take chances with the wild COVID infection or to get vaccinated - I think there's more risk from COVID.  For those who haven't read the study or the group's conclusion, here it is:

**""In conclusion, our data show that the BNT162b2 vaccine induces effects on both the adaptive and the innate branch of immunity and that these effects are different for various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Intriguingly, the BNT162b2 vaccine induces reprogramming of innate immune responses as well, and this needs to be taken into account: in combination with strong adaptive immune responses, this could contribute to a more balanced inflammatory reaction during COVID-19 infection, or it may contribute to a diminished innate immune response towards the virus. BNT162b2 vaccine is clearly protective against COVID-19, but the duration of this protection is not yet known, and one could envisage future generations of the vaccine incorporating this knowledge to improve the range and duration of the protection. Our findings need to be confirmed by conducting larger cohort-studies with populations with diverse backgrounds, while further studies should examine the potential interactions between BNT162b2 and other vaccines.""**",nqyjcz,2021-06-03 03:16:07

And I completely understand Covid vaccine skepticism so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But then I got a PM from someone with a link to some shady blog telling me that if I got the vaccine, it‚Äôs already too late and I‚Äôm already dead.

But you have to keep in mind that this specific subreddit is not subjected to one country or even one continent. This is a worldwide based subreddit where anyone can access it. 

So you have a billion people at your doorstep who have been vaccinated and you only get a small handful of people with bad reactions? That perfectly ties in with the percentage of those that will have a reaction. I wish more people realized this.",nq3x89,2021-06-02 16:53:51

If you dont share the negative experience then how would the world know. Its a given that vaxx has supposed better benefits than risks so there is not need to report on positive vaccinations. It was meant to be that way but since trials wont be complete till 2023. It is also obvious that there is a possibility of adverse effects happening,nq3x89,2021-06-02 06:56:16

"Yep, and even many of the negative experiences can be explained by other issues or coincidence. You have people on here reporting being given genetically-based disorders by the vaccine, which is impossible. Then you have some people who attribute problems to a vaccine, but no doctor or other professional has agreed. With almost 2 BILLION doses given there will be people who coincidentally have serious health issues shortly after being vaccinated.",nq3x89,2021-06-02 21:14:59

"What are yout honest thoughts on mine? 

I have had health anxiety since i was 14 it was alot better until i was around the age of 22 after i had a allergic reaction to the antibiotic cirpo i got dry eyes not long after that and then i started to think my plantar facsitis 7 months later was a result of this but i didnt think it was until i read about people getting adverse reactions a year later in 2018.

Then every health issue i had from 2017 to 2018 i thought it was a result of this.

When in reality it most likely wasnt.

Almost every health issue ive had recnetly my doctor is always like "" you know its your anxiety and shes been spot on everytime.

Althougj ive been having trouble swallowing food and eating for soke time unfortuneatly so i am getting a scope done in a few weeks to rule out any pshyical causes and if none are found  its defiently my anxiety causing it.

However when i talked to her yesterday about my side effects to pfizer she said well if fhey dont improve my thrusday give me a call and that worried me for some reason.

She did say its likely my immune system responding in this way because im younger and its more robust.

But also i should add thay atleast here so far adverse reactions seem to be pretty rare only about 6000 or so have been reported in canada out of the millions ot peoole who have gotten it and only a small fractiom of thosr people have serious ones.

Its not to discredit these peoppe and i do feel bad for them but statistically speaking i should be fine i hope.",nq3x89,2021-06-02 17:03:22

There is a good chance thay atleast some or most of what im feelijg is anxiety. 

I mean i was able to convince myself that i had gotten fatigue, brain fog, body aches for 2 weeks  5- 6 months after having covid and convinced myself i had become a long hauler im not trying to discredit abyoje who has gone through that.

 But i saw some posts on there in the long haul sub  they said they got long haul symptoms months after testing positive (3-5 months after) now im not saying its impossble and cant as im not a doctor but my doctor straight up told me that i couldnt possibly have them that far away out. 

Everytime ive gone to my doctor about its always been fine i had something called chronic pelvic pain after a fall on my tailbone along with back pain in 2018 

Went onto fourms for it and it was full of despair, hopelessness, negativity and this made me even more anxious and depressed at the time.

My mum was literally bedridden from covid and it took her months to recover, and that wasn't even a case severe enough for hospitalisation, and I have other high risk relatives who are thankfully either fully vaccinated or have at least had their first jab. I have a few other family members who are against the covid vaccines too, they believe the usual pandemic conspiracy theories. I don't try to convince them because it won't change their minds, but I do find it upsetting.  

If you have had covid, you are more likely to have those rough initial symptoms of the vaccines. My mum was told this, and it was true for her with her AZ shot. 

The pandemic has really been brutal on my mental health. I live in a different country from my family so I haven't seen my family in person for so long. It's also a huge nightmare for health anxiety. Where I live the vaccine rollout has been very slow, my age group is the last one and is currently estimated to be done mid-september (I ""cheated"" by being quick to sign up for an opt-in program offering J&J or AZ after they had been dropped from the official vaccine plan here).

"The J&J/AZ vaccines do exactly the same thing as the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines. The only difference is that J&J/AZ adds one step to the process: an adenovirus is used to ""infect"" your cells and have them produce the mRNA that directs your body to produce the spike protein, whereas Pfizer/Moderna just injects that mRNA directly(encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles).

At the end of the day, they all do the same thing: deliver mRNA that directs your cells to produce the spike protein.

J&J is only said to be ""more traditional"" in the sense that viral vectors have been used before whereas direct mRNA injections have not.  None of the vaccines are traditional vaccines though.",nqumk9,2021-06-02 22:21:47

If you‚Äôre in the US, you really have two main options, viral vector (J&J) or mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna). They all give near 100% protection against severe cases (requiring hospitalization). J&J has 74.4% efficacy. Moderna is 94.1%. Pfizer is 95%. Both mRNA options are two doses and J&J is single dose. If you‚Äôre worried about allergic reactions or are anxious about the shot, J&J might be a good option for you because it‚Äôs one and done. The downside is the lower efficacy and a low risk of blood clots that we‚Äôve heard so much about (VERY low risk... I personally don‚Äôt even consider them a factor but if you fall in a high risk category for the blood clots, it might be something to take into consideration). Take a look at the possible side effects on those fact sheets and figure out which one will be best for you. 

Keep in mind that people who post about their experience here aren‚Äôt reflective of the actual general side effects. If you get a vaccine and have only expected side effects or none at all, you‚Äôre unlikely to post about it asking for help or reassurance.

First, I had pounding/irregular/intense heartbeat, and tightness in my chest. I went to a cardiologist and confirmed that I had myocarditis (inflammation in heart area). Second, I had inflammation/pressure around the ears, contributing to dizziness/disorientation/headaches, which is exactly what you're describing above. The combination of the two was a disaster, made it difficult to do any meaningful work.   
  
Went to several doctors, who weren't really that helpful except confirming what I have, suggesting 1,200 mg Advil per day. A couple other things I've done that have helped: Ice pack around head and around heart multiple times per day, for 15 min at a time. Blue light blocking glasses to look at computer screens (I'm also in number crunching industry). No exercise, but go for a 15 minute walk twice a day. Listen to ""binaural beats"" which is meditation music that calms the brain. Make sure you have enough magnesium in your body. 

It's been 25 days. I actually took this week off, because I tried so hard to work through it last week (and did some exercise) that my heart was really not doing well. But i've been completely resting since Saturday and finally feeling a little better. I think it will still take weeks but i think there's a path to getting back to normal.

u/FridChikn in response to your Qs: 1) yeah doctor was the one who actually recommended I go up to that amount (but not exceed that amount). He said it's basically the best thing he could ""prescribe"" to me in terms of anti-inflammatory. And I feel like it's helped, going up to that amount. I take 400mg at 3 different points in the day. 2) yeah doc pointed out magnesium since I was on lower-end (still within range), but a temporary minor boost can help regulate sleep, blood pressure, mood, cardiovascular / nervous system. And I've seen other Reddit users dealing w/ vaccine reactions post similar things about supplementing with safe amount of magnesium to calm themselves and sleep better. 2) Yeah lol constant ice packs sounds intense, but it's been by far the most important thing for me. Without the ice packs multiple times per day, I'd be 100% non-functional with the inflammation

u/tatertoth Agree with all your points!",nqdqh1,2021-06-03 01:41:31

We just had our once in 4 year check-up with her cardiologist and I did ask the question because, as you can imagine, I am worried about this side effect. Her dr, whom I really trust, said that the incidence is very rare and even if it happens it goes away on its own and it is nothing to worry about. He said that usually it can happen 7 days after the vaccine. I hope it is not going to happen at all.",nq5xh8,2021-06-02 13:47:05
"Want to share my story here. I'm a 25 year old male (in US), extremely active, no pre-existing conditions.

**I got the second Pfizer shot on May 8, and it gave me myocarditis. I have been to several doctors including a cardiologist, and have confirmed it.** 

I've been completely compromised for 3+ weeks now. Luckily there is nothing life threatening going on, as confirmed by the series of heart tests I've run. But I have been out of work. Have pounding/intense/irregular heartbeats. Combined with inflammation around the ears/head contributing to headaches/dizziness/disorientation. Which has made it difficult to do anything (including think or sleep). Head is a balloon, chest feels like it weighs a ton of bricks. 

I see a lot of comments trying to quickly disparage the Israel report, and bury any negative information about the vaccine. I think that is extremely dangerous. Yes I am only one person, but I am absolutely POSITIVE that in a small number of young males, this is a serious thing that is happening. So if you are a young male, I would take an extra second of caution with respect to the second shot. Personally I don't think we should have the same vaccine requirements as an 80 year old person, it's too strong. The CDC needs to continue to investigate this because there is a link and it is very real - i've experienced it.",nq5xh8,2021-06-02 22:19:01

"I‚Äôm one of the rare cases who got myocarditis from my second Moderna vaccine, around 70 hours after vaccination (28 year old male). 13 hours after vaccination I had chills that shook me so hard my back started spasming, it looked like I was having convulsions. I had every other symptom that evening as well (fever, nausea, headache, etc.).

Woke up at 6am 3 days later with severe chest pain. Ended up in the hospital for 3 days as they ran tests. I‚Äôve been out for 2 weeks now and have been progressively feeling better. Yesterday the cardiologist said I can mostly return to normal life, but no strenuous activity for 3 months. ‚ÄúLight cardio‚Äù only (walking).

I wonder what would‚Äôve happened had I gotten COVID... Many people do end up with myocarditis with the illness, so perhaps I would‚Äôve been taken out HARD. If I were to go back in time, I probably would‚Äôve took the Johnson and Johnson... I am glad to be vaccinated, though.

In the US cases in VAERS, which are also weighted to second dose, a few of the first dose cases have documented prior covid.

"I'm 64 and have easily triggered health anxiety, so I was determined to get the Pfizer jab but nervous. First shot, slightly sore arm but I lifted light dumbbell-style weights that night in Zumba Toning.   They say that makes it go away, and it did. Also got a caffeine-style headache six hours after first shot and Tylenol banished it. Maybe once or twice the next day I had fleeting sense of fatigue, but then again, that was after walking around a botanical garden all afternoon.  

Second shot was 32 hours ago and my only side effect is a faintly sore throat and a few random muscle aches today, as one would get from exercise.

On a weird positive note, I was very energized this afternoon about 24 hours after the shot, and went on a mad tear of making meatloaf and cleaning the kitchen followed by livelier-than-usual participation in online Zumba class.

Most of what I've thought might be mild side effects in the past 3 weeks has turned out to be nothing people don't feel every day and think nothing about - so I was a trifle dizzy one day, and my existing GERD got worse. Then my doctor pointed out that I'd been cheating on my GERD diet (lemonade, tomatoes, raw onion and a half a bag of potato chips), and that I have a tendency to get dehydrated in exercise class.  She thinks I've had no reactions to Shot 1 except the headache and sore arm that don't have a more obvious explanation.

Try keeping hydrated, rest and stay cool and comfy. Maybe watch your favourite TV show or something (and stop checking your pulse is good advice too).

Sounds like some shit I'd rather not get put in my body. I was tested positive at first of pandemic. Never even felt sick. Now to this day my doctor say I still have immunity and recommends only getting the shot if it will make me feel better. He says That since we heard immunity we should save the vaccines for the ones hit really hard in the poor country's. Think about the treatment they get compared to us. And here we are sucking up vaccines for a sickness most of us never feel. Vaccinate the elderly and at risk not the young healthy people scared to go thru a simple cold. The science is there none of it is false. Instead of worrying about rather people like us or not or we are accepted let's do what's right not what we are told by a old crazy man that is trying to strip every right you have from under your nose.

Long story short, I had an elevated HR to my baseline and HR spikes where it would go up to 160 at rest. It took about 3 weeks to normalize. Every doctor I talked to (included the ED doc) had zero answers and said there is still a lot we are learning about the vaccine. I think there's various possibilities to what could cause it - dehydration, hormonal imbalance, inflammation - but I think it will be a while before we get any answers.

* Although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant people and recently pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared to non-pregnant people.
* Having certain underlying medical conditions, and other factors, including age, can further increase a pregnant or recently pregnant person‚Äôs risk for developing severe illness.
* Pregnant people with COVID-19 are also at increased risk for preterm birth (delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks) and might be at increased risk for other poor pregnancy outcomes.

"Hey, first dose of Pfizer got me six days later.  I initially had the painful injection site and thought I got off lucky.  Evening of the sixth day i noticed my neck and clavicle area were sore, so naturally I went to rub it and noticed not only the pain but the swelling.  It happened out of the blue and became so painful it hurt to wear a shirt.  Went to the ER as instructed which was useless, was told no cancer (kinda figured that myself thanks) went home and took time from work to rest.  It was sore to touch for about 3 days and the swelling subsided slightly.  Still swollen but nowhere near as badly. Not as painful at all.  Was told to push out my second shot which is good as I'm pretty nervous after getting told it's .3% of folks that are getting this with Pfizer and slightly higher with Moderna and usually not as drawn out so the delay I'm reaction is unusual evidently.

"Same problem just as you described. Full body neuropathy, cant sleep. Living an actual nightmare. My elbow lymph node still keeps swelling terribly painful and loss of use of hands, cant make a fist. Extreme weakness. Nerves firing.

Only one shot was Pfizer 4/18/21. 10 days later upper arm pain. 20 days locking joints in that arm. Then nerve spasms and numbness. It since moved to full body numbness loss of legs, arms. Seizure like zapping. Trip to ER.

Legs arms returned w bad weakness and now unstoppable neuropathy. Hospital ER didn't know what to do. Still trying to get in to a neurologist. All doctors everywhere are booked. 

I got in to PT that has been doing lymph drainage techniques for the arm. It works for a day then comes right back.

I didn't sleep for days, i can sleep now but only 2 hour pockets. Then my body electric zaps me awake, 125 heart rate and I'm numb in the limbs. 

I am better that i was at the peak body loss but its still very difficult. I also have ears ringing 24/7. Im 38/M no known auto immune issues but have suspected possible undiagnosed in the past. Clearly sometimes different about us. My gf got Pfizer 2 shots and is fine",npxt8g,2021-06-01 20:55:33

Since it's not a patentable medicine, there's been little research into because it's consequently unprofitable. 

My take is that it could help in both these cases.  I hope it does!

Best wishes to you",npxt8g,2021-06-02 00:06:28
"I‚Äôm in the process of making a list to discuss with my doctor o all the suggestions I‚Äôve found online for an appointment later this week, so perfect timing. My doctor cannot find anything in official medical literature on similar reactions. Wish we could get all of our doctors together to discuss.
Sorry you have been dealing with this for so long without answers. I understand what you have been through and it is definitely very hard. Glad to hear you are getting some relief.",npxt8g,2021-06-01 18:55:37
"I know cannabis is antiinflammatory which is why I thought I would try it for this, and I don‚Äôt know why it would make it worse either- it didn‚Äôt make the sensations more intense, but they seemed to be happening more often",npxt8g,2021-06-02 00:33:24
"I haven‚Äôt tried valerian, may try it, thanks. Magnesium helps too. I don‚Äôt normally have trouble sleeping but just occasionally",npxt8g,2021-06-02 00:34:19
"I‚Äôve had THC/CBD make (overactive) nerve problems unbearable when it was supposed to help. I can‚Äôt even tell if either one helps at all for that, so I think not.",npxt8g,2021-06-02 05:45:22
"Pretty much that. The pain was worse in the early weeks, but flares to this day and crops up as sharp at times, along with weakness in my arm. Sucks.",npxt8g,2021-06-01 23:24:23
"Potential diagnosis might be small fiber neuropathy or damage to the small unmyelinated (sp?) nerves in the body due to an autoimmune response to the vaccine. This can be tested with an anti-ganglionic nicotinic AChR antibodies test.

This type of response might fall within the constellation of symptoms being categorized by scientists as allergic reactions to the vaccine.

"It can stimulate the nervous system, even if it appears to do the opposite. Which is strange but yeah. Thc is stimulating I think. CBD is maybe more neutral but it can also have that effect",npxt8g,2021-06-02 05:47:14
"I haven't found pot/cbd to be very helpful for severe pain (nerve or other) except for headaches, but it never made my pain worse either.  They are good for anxiety, depression, headaches, nausea, sometimes insomnia.  Lyrica helped with nerve pain though.

""THC"" is a broad term, I've heard of strong sativa strains causing anxiety, paranoia, restlessness, it could make the CNS overactive and worsen nerve pain.  Indica dominant strains probably won't have this effect unless they were badly grown or not flushed (should make you calm, subdued etc).  Edibles don't always list what is in them (eg 20% sativa, 80% indica).",npxt8g,2021-06-02 16:12:45
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Did they ever give you an explanation for why it might have happened?,npxt8g,2021-06-02 16:35:12

"In my household we all waited two weeks post second vaccine to venture out maskless. I did go out to a restaurant that was indoors, I mask up at the grocery store, but outside activities or patio dining I would feel perfectly safe going maskless.

Her first round has given her a good deal of protection, sounds like you‚Äôll be ok!",nqikja,2021-06-02 15:34:13
"According to all the medical recommendations I have read, she won't benefit from the full effectiveness of the vaccine until two weeks after her second shot.  

Similarly, you will benefit from some efficacy (50-80%) from two weeks after your first shot. But neither of you is fully protected yet, and no vaccine is 100% effective anyway. So I suggest you still take basic precautions where possible, if you don't want to risk catching Covid.",nqikja,2021-06-02 16:47:59
"Yes, 2 months out and I'm still learning to cope with my new anxiety. Never once experienced anxiety until 3 days after my second dose. It may have been triggered by the upset stomach that was made worse with the anxiety.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 20:45:38
"35 yo male here.  I got my first shot on Tuesday May 4.  That following Thursday night I was unable to fall asleep until 6am.  I usually lay my head down at midnight and am out within 5 minutes.  I dealt with horrible panic and insomnia for about 10 days.  And then about 3 days of it slowly subsiding.  Then it was totally  gone.  I had none of those reactions after my second shot thankfully.  For me, I think the fact that I read a lot on here that people are having the same reactions and they didn't last forever was comforting. I think knowing that there was an end in sight really helped me get past it.  I haven't had a single panic attack since and I am sleeping great.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 23:35:22
"I got the J&J single-shot vaccine and it's now 10 days since. I thought I was just tired all the time but noticed that I also have very negative thoughts with an undercurrent of panic feelings, especially at night. It's getting better but I still feel super tired, feel depressed, and anxious at the same time.  


I'm thinking it's some kind of lingering neurological inflammation, but since most drugs can't pass the blood-brain barrier, it's not easy to treat it.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 21:51:13
"Panic attacks and anxiety lifer here as well!  It might help to educate her about how panic attacks work.  You know what might have caused the second one?  The first one.  Now she is anxious about the attacks, which will cause more anxiety, and it snowballs.

We can't say if the first was caused by the vaccine, or by a cold, or just something weird her body was doing.  But the best thing someone can do in the early stages of developing anxiety disorders is to quickly learn that they have much more power than they think they do.  

She can stop them.  She just has to learn how.  Is it easy?  No.  I have had anxiety my whole life and it will never go away.  But if people like me can kick their panic attacks to the curb, there is absolutely hope for her.

Still, it wouldn't hurt to go to the doctor.  Lots of medical things can cause these symptoms, and if she is still suffering they can help with a referral to psychological help.

This is probably something that will just be a bad memory.  Empower her--she is lucky to have you, don't forget to take care of your own anxiety.  You matter and are worth the self-care.",nq0mom,2021-06-02 05:31:08
"I experienced pretty intense panic attacks after the vaccine. Still not sure if they're over. Panic attacks can be a sign of dysautonomia. I have dysautonomia and the vaccine really aggravated it. Feeling dizzy and almost fainting can also be dysautonomia symptoms. She may have underlying dysautonomia and didn't realise it or the vaccine may have triggered dysautonomia (which can be temporary or more longterm, to my understanding). Don't listen to people if they say oh it must be psychological. It could very well be but the timing following vaccine and the other symptoms also makes dysautonomia a strong possibility. I'm not a doctor, just a fellow patient sharing.",nq0mom,2021-06-02 06:32:34
"This is why, I haven‚Äôt received my second dose yet. My first one just caused a flair up with anxiety and panic that hasn‚Äôt gone away yet. It felt like it got better after 3 weeks post vaccine but there is enough there yet.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 19:47:48
"She should see a doctor just to be sure. However, ever since covid started spreading we have been inundated with stressful news and restrictions. Many people have anxiety who have never had it before. 

Prolonged stress negatively affects people and chances are that is what she is experiencing, just as many others have. Being evaluated by a doctor could ease her mind. 

There are many relaxation tips and techniques online as well, including mindfulness meditation. Yoga could help, reading or a good funny movie are other things to try. Her body needs to heal from the extended stress.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 19:53:20
"what meds do you take for your anxiety and panic attacks?

maybe she could get some anti-anxiety prescribed with some anti-inflammation stuff

i don't think it's stress-related/psycho. It's seems to be a vaccine-induced physical problem",nq0mom,2021-06-02 00:30:23
"It‚Äôs been a month since my second Pfizer shot and I started experiencing sleeping problems shortly after I got it.  Can‚Äôt fall asleep without Klonopin now because of my anxiety.  CBD has helped somewhat, but I‚Äôm still med-dependent to fall asleep.  I do feel like it‚Äôs improving, but very slowly.",nq0mom,2021-06-02 16:43:11
I have GAD. I had to take Rivotril (clonazepam) for my anxiety when my usual coping mechanisms didn‚Äôt work.,nq0mom,2021-06-02 17:09:04
"Sorry to hear you‚Äôre going through it as well :/ it‚Äôs so strange. It‚Äôll be interesting to see months/years from now what the latest studies are with the vaccine. I‚Äôm still fully pro-vax and think people should get the covid shot, but seeing stuff like this is discerning.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 21:13:48
Wow thanks for your comment! That definitely brings me some relief and will pass this along to my partner. Glad to hear you‚Äôre feeling better!,nq0mom,2021-06-01 23:59:05
"Sorry to hear that! I‚Äôm thinking it might have to do with inflammation as well but I also have no idea, this is just what others have been assuming. If that‚Äôs the case then maybe anti inflammatory medicine will help but again, I‚Äôm not a doctor so who knows.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 22:14:29
"Hey thanks for the great reply! We really aren‚Äôt sure what caused the second one and the ones that followed - she said that she started just getting waves of panic out of no where. I‚Äôve dealt with panic and attacks and anxiety for as long as I can remember so I feel your pain! While it breaks my heart seeing her go through this, it‚Äôs been somewhat of a blessing that I have dealt with them for so long because I can help calm her a bit and give her coping tips. 

She did go to the doctor and they said that her anxiety was likely a symptom of her side affects but that was about it. Aside from that her vitals and what not came back great. I told her it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to go back if things don‚Äôt subside on their own in the coming days/weeks so we‚Äôll see how things go. 

It‚Äôs been interesting and humbling being the one talking her down from a panic attack after she‚Äôs done that for me the last 6 years we‚Äôve been together. I appreciate your kind words!",nq0mom,2021-06-02 14:50:56
Thanks for the reply and for this information! We will keep this in mind if things don‚Äôt improve or if her dizziness gets worse. Luckily the dizziness has pretty much completely gone away.,nq0mom,2021-06-02 14:52:10
"Thanks for the response, totally get where you‚Äôre coming from. I actually remember telling my partner that my anxiety was really bad for the week after our first dose, but just brushed it off since it started going away. She didn‚Äôt experience anything aside from minor dizziness and a sore arm after the first shot.

We both actually were exposed to covid the day after our first shots, and ended up testing positive a few days after. I‚Äôm holding off on my second shot for now since I still have antibodies and am hesitant that my side affects may be worse. She went for it and got her second shot and so far unfortunately regrets it since she was basically already covered (for the time being having recovered from covid), and is pretty certain the vaccine triggered her anxiety/panic. 

We‚Äôre in no way anti-vax and were very excited about getting the shot. It just seems like the inflammation from it is causing other unforeseen issues like this with some people.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 19:52:55
"Thanks for the response! I definitely think that has added some stress along with some other stuff going on in our lives. I think the panic attacks are what‚Äôs most concerning for her because let‚Äôs be honest, they fucking suck, especially if you‚Äôve never had one. She did actually go to the doctor and they basically said her anxiety was a symptom of her side affects (ie getting stressed about the side affects). Not sure I buy that considering her anxiety is still here and all her other symptoms are gone, but who knows! Hoping it will improve on its own along with exercise and breathing techniques.",nq0mom,2021-06-01 21:12:05

"I actually haven‚Äôt been prescribed anything for years now and have been able to cope, but will be going back to the doctor soon to get reevaluated. This last year was terrible for my mental health like many others. But yes that‚Äôs a good idea for her to look into if this doesn‚Äôt go away on it‚Äôs own.",nq0mom,2021-06-02 14:45:33
"Interesting, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I‚Äôm glad it is slowly going away.",nq0mom,2021-06-02 17:21:49
No problem. Hope it passes soon.  I also drank a lot of calming tea and just kept my mind as busy as possible. Not sure if it helped with anything.  But it couldn't hurt.,nq0mom,2021-06-02 01:44:35

This was a symptom I had in the beginning (for a couple weeks starting about a week out from the second Pfizer vaccine).

Unfortunately I still have the persistent headaches and heart tachycardia/pounding...,nq9qax,2021-06-02 04:08:43
"I've gone into a huge reflux flare. It has already begun by the second day of the shot. I already have a diagnosis for it prior to vaccine but hadn't had a flare like this in over a year. The chest pain and tightness are horrible. If I didn't understand the issue I'd probably be running for an ekg right now lol. Anyway have had to resort to only wearing lose clothing until it settles down, which will hopefully be soon. I don't really understand why the vaccine can amplify digestive issues though.",nq9qax,2021-06-02 05:48:56
I have gastritis chronically and for some reason my first dose had zero effect on it. It didn't make it worse at all. No GI issues with my first dose. I had a ridiculously painful arm as my worst side effect personally.,nq9qax,2021-06-02 15:57:31

It seems overall inflammatory and stressful to the body. Stomach would suffer from inflammation as well in people susceptible to this,nq9qax,2021-06-02 05:53:23
Yep inflammation would be part of it. And I think also effect on the autonomic system which can affect digestion. I keep forgetting my body is under a lot of stress from this and keep trying to carry on as completely normal.,nq9qax,2021-06-02 06:58:26

"I didn't have cramps after my Moderna shots but I felt extremely thirsty and had that funny about to cramp feeling. I read some discussions in this sub about people suffering from extreme cramping, fainting and low magnesium and sodium tests and it made a lot of sense. Ask your doctor to check your sodium, magnesium, vitamin B and D levels. As a long time cramp sufferer due to vitamin deficiencies and venous insufficiency these are some of the usual tests I do. Also discuss with your doctor if you should have your previous blood tests done again (including d-dimer, ESR and platelets).  I had a doctor's appointment after 7 days of my first shot - not vaccine related but general endocrinologist check up - and my doctor explained that I should have waited 3 to 4 weeks after the vaccine  as the immune response to the vaccine can alter the results.

Probably a lymph node that‚Äôs swollen. I‚Äôve heard a lot of stories of armpit lymph nodes being tender or swollen and a couple of breasts. Just means your immune system is responding. Hopefully your doctor can confirm that so you don‚Äôt have to worry,nq1b93,2021-06-01 19:47:57
Swollen lymph node (s). It‚Äôs common.,nq1b93,2021-06-01 20:14:43
"Shooting pains, achy pains...there are lymph nodes on and around your breasts- don‚Äôt freak out. My dr had seen a lot of that & said it‚Äôs normal. For me the shooting pain lasted 2-3 weeks and general lymph node pain went away by week 3 or so",nq1b93,2021-06-01 22:55:33
So I had the exact same thing. For the most part if your breast is hurting after the vaccine it‚Äôs not due to actual breast hurting but your pectoral muscle which is connected to your deltoid. The pain from my vaccination point went all the way to my pectoral muscle on the left and my muscle in the back where the shoulder is,nq1b93,2021-06-01 20:51:07
I don't think there are lymph nodes where I'm feeling it but I hope so. Thank you.,nq1b93,2021-06-01 20:25:26

I just don't get that huge hard lump-ish thing ontop of my breast over the nipple area. Really freaking me out.,nq1b93,2021-06-02 00:50:52
Yeah my shoulder and back area still hurt. I was fine before the vaccine but I can't be mad because I know if I got covid I would be in trouble. My friend had it and she still needs to see doctors for all the damage it did.,nq1b93,2021-06-02 05:27:31
"Because the lymph system drains the remnants of the mrna and old cells out of the body and as the command centers of the immune response, they‚Äôre the site of a lot of the inflammation (which you want and need for the vaccine to work) and the closest ones to the injection site are in or near your breasts, hence the pains in that area.",nq1b93,2021-06-02 00:39:39
There shouldn't be a lymph node right there. Does it feel like it is in the breast tissue or in the skin?,nq1b93,2021-06-02 03:56:41
That‚Äôs awful. Sending well wishes your way. I‚Äôm a 21 f and currently I‚Äôm having a headache with wooziness and leg weakness with muscle aches.

"So you want inflammation which the vaccine creates and that is a good thing?  I‚Äôve never heard of a vaccine effecting so many parts of the body as this one.  So because they tell you breast pain is normal and swollen lymph nodes with these vaccines are normal, you just believe and accept that.",nq1b93,2021-06-02 01:44:12
It feels right underneath the skin but I'm not sure. My health anxiety is so severe I can't think straight.,nq1b93,2021-06-02 05:24:58

"Inflammation isn‚Äôt always bad. Inflammation is what clears an infection when you are sick, or keeps a cut from getting infected. Inflammation creates the immune response to the vaccine.

"Really sorry you are going through this stress, I know that‚Äôs not fun. I hope the doctor visit can help you figure it out & feel better.",nq1b93,2021-06-02 05:33:40
"It could be a cyst. If it appeared that suddenly it's not likely cancer or anything like that.  I have several cysts, one on my breast, that I just suddenly noticed one day. They aren't dangerous and have never grown or anything. The one on my breast really scared me when it appeared and my doctor assured me it was just a cyst.  Your breasts have all sorts of glands and stuff, too. Any lump is mostly likely nothing serious. It's good you're having it checked, though.

Oh and the stabbing pain thing is usually hormonal.  Just keep an eye on if it happens regularly. People do seem to be having hormonal issues with the shot, but hopefully that straightens out.",nq1b93,2021-06-02 06:10:30

"honestly, reading this sub has been the worst thing for me, given that i'm already very nervous about shot 2 for both me and, in particular, my adult son.  in our case, this is due to a) my prior childhood reactions to vaccines; b) his history of health problems (too much for here and his illnesses are so rare that most won't have heard of them anyway) - so although i'm pro-vax and obviously we've gotten our first shots, i'm nervous AF *anyway*, and this sub makes me MORE nervous.

the only thing keeping me sane at this point is that at least 90% of the people i know both personally and at work - including my own husband - have gotten both shots [my son and i are pretty much the last in our circle among those who intend to get the shots] and the worst story i've heard is  my FIL [pfizer] and coworker [moderna], who were both down with flu-like symptoms for three days.  

so i'm trying to stay calm and not let this sub get to me, because anecdotally, at least, no one i personally know has had a severe reaction to either one, and those who have had reactions at all have been pretty much evenly split between pfizer and moderna.

i say this because i'm less inclined to believe ""the media"" - good or bad - than i am to believe what i'm seeing/hearing among my circle.  it's also worth noting that 'my circle' when it comes to work and family includes literally dozens of healthcare professionals - actual clinicians; doctors, nurses, PAs, RTs, etc.  (i work for a major insurer, and a not-insignificant number of my friends and family are in healthcare as well.)  this sub throws a wrench into that, but in my circles, the shots haven't caused huge problems.  so i'm trying to keep that in mind and REALLY hoping i don't have a horror story to tell here around mid-june.

editing to add, since a member of my household has actually had shot 2 on may 21 (pfizer), a report on him:  first shot, sore arm, nothing else.  second shot, felt 'hungover' for a day.  woke up with a mild headache for five days after, treated with ibuprofen, gone within an hour of waking.  no other issues reported; we were both surprised by his minimal response to the vaccine.   my son, first shot, moderna - sore arm.  me, first shot, pfizer - sore arm.  the two of us have our second shots on the 8th and 9th, respectively.

editing again to also add - i believe we (or at least i) all had covid in april of last year.  this isn't proven because we never got tested for antibodies and although i [47F, overweight at the time] had the most severe symptoms over the span of three weeks and was tested, the lab *lost my results*.  so any reactions i eventually report, or not, should be viewed in the lens of, we may or may not have previously had covid.",npheq6,2021-06-01 05:37:03
"I just had my first Moderna shot. I'm a laundry list of medical conditions, and I had no reaction aside from a sore arm and fatigue. Husband just had J&J, felt like a truck hit him the next day, but day 3 absolutely fine! Best friend, MIL, and mother all have had both Moderna and doing amazing 3 months post vax. Both brothers have had J&J with body aches and mild flu like symptoms (one is a diabetic with a recent ketoacidosis scare.) My field is considered essential so we've been getting vaccinated since they first became available and I've yet to know anyone with a severe reaction (~500 people I am personally aware of.) 

On the flip side there's been 3 Covid deaths in my immediate circle, 4 hospitalizations, and numerous people with continuing long term repercussions to their health. Incidentally all but 1 of these people is friend or family from Texas. The outlier is from MA but was forced to continue travelling during the pandemic. Her case was traced back to FL after her death.

If you have a medical condition, or are already sick and not currently showing symptoms there is a possibility that the vaccine can cause a flare up. There is also a possibility you may simply have a bad reaction, and one where a piano falls on your head. It's hard to say how each and every individual will react to anything, ever.  Your immune system needs to put in overtime teaching T cells all about how to defend you against Covid, and this can temporarily make things seems to go a bit haywire. Get hydrated, take vitamins, eat healthy and help that gut bacteria! Have some pain reliever on hand, and plan to sit  and potato for a day or 2 while your immune system buffs up!",npheq6,2021-06-01 12:49:53

"The higher impact side effects aren't talked about being they simply aren't happening that much or becoming common. When the vax rate was low in both over all population numbers and percentage of population in the USA the impact of the few people having real issues stood out more in general. 


but when you start to have states like CA with 38m doses given out, 17m fully vax and pushing 40% of the entire state's population and still not seeing wide spread issues then we clearly don't have wide spread issues. Being it would impossible to cover up 10m people with issues, 5m people etc. 


My own zip code in Sacramento CA is nearly 78% vax for everyone 12 and older. So almost 8 out of 10 of everyone over the age of 12 that I see on walks or in the local store etc have all gotten the vax. I'm just not hearing anything other than it was no big deal for all neighbors, friends, their parents etc. If we were at say 20% vax rate I would still be thinking ok well most haven't even gotten a shot yet, but were at 78% now.",npheq6,2021-06-01 06:10:03

I'm fine now and grateful every day that we live in a time where a vaccine is available. And if nothing else, what I took home from my experience is this: Covid likely is very, very rough.

"The data we have for, say, Pfizer (verified by third party health bodies as well as Pfizer themselves - who would lose a LOT of money if they lied) is something like:

\- over 1 out of 10 people may get some light side effects (i.e.: almost 9 out of 10 people don't get any side effects)

\- 1 out of 100 people may get moderate-strong side effects

\- up to 1 person per 1,000 people may get very severe side effects

\- a miniscule (uncountable) number get extremely severe side effects

That's the data. That's it. And the numbers for what happens when you actually get COVID are much worse.

You'll be noticing ""presentation bias"", where the 90% of people who get no side effects are silent, but the 0.1% who get serious side effects talk about it a lot. A LOT. Like, almost every post on this sub.

Not really covered up but rather their past is not well reported. For example, Moderna had a lot of safety issues with their mRNA technology. A lot of the toxicity comes from their modified nucleotides which with one or two doses seems to be fine, but for cancer immunotherapy, you need multiple doses which have lead to toxic reactions.  


Page 11 of this report compared covid vaccines to the flu vaccine side effects, and you can see it's a lot higher for the covid vaccines, though on a absolute level it's not that many.

This isn‚Äôt like known rare side effects to existing vaccines like Guillermo barre. These are unique to the covid vaccine.

 I suspect, but one cannot ever prove, that people who get an immunological disorder or serious reaction from the vaccine, would also get one from the virus, because of similar proteins in both.

If there were any desire to cover up negative reactions, we wouldn't know about those cases. 

I keep saying this because it doesn't seem to get through to everyone, but there are no perfect choices in a pandemic. You can choose to be at-risk and risk the absolutely well-known risks of COVID or you can choose to be vaccinated and take those risks. So far, the chances of dying from a vaccine are about one in a million and the chances of dying from COVID about one in six hundred.

The public doesn't understand that it takes some time to figure out causality and doesn't understand that because X came post vaccine doesn't that X is vaccine related.

Right now I have a strange rash on my leg, it came out of nowhere and as of now my doctor doesn't know what it is. Thing is it popped up months ago before any vaccine, but what would I have thought if this randomly popped up AFTER the vaccine? I would probably think it was caused by it. It is important to remember that correlation does not equal causation.

Certain dangerous side effects have *almost* been confirmed, specifically blood clots associated with J&J and AstraZeneca. A researcher currently believes he has discovered the specific cause. These more dangerous *potential* side effects are so extremely rare we don't know they are actually caused by the vaccines. Statistically you are more likely to get struck my lightning than have these issues.  This makes it extremely difficult to narrow down the cause.",npheq6,2021-06-01 22:19:35

it's also worth noting that my concerns are based less on the experiences here and more on very specifically on my son's (and my own) personal histories.

if there's someone reading this who has had a bad reaction to the vaccine - bad being more than flu like symptoms for a few days, that is - who *also* has opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, a former brain surgery to remove a 2.5cm acoustic neuroma (and a resulting propensity to headache), AND keratoconus that required another surgery 18 months ago... THAT'S a story i'd be interested in hearing, here, and would probably put a lot of stock in.  but given that all three diagnoses are individually incredibly rare - much less likely to happen in the same person [my son keeps winning these lotteries] - i suspect i will never read a story from someone like that here.

"That is the beauty of anecdotal evidence. You can nitpick 10 from your sample size of 20 and say ‚Äúthey were ALL OK‚Äù while ignoring all other data, brushing it off that it does not matter because you have never seen those people. 

That is the exact opposite of how science works and of how the safety of the vaccines (or any other pharmaceutical product) is being determined. Even if you saw 1000 posts on Reddit depicting absolutely terrible side effects AFTER the vaccine, and 10 people posting here they had sore arm and nothing else, would you deduct that the odds of getting a bad reaction are 1000:10?

Instead, they recruited tens of thousands of volunteers last year, half of them got the vaccine, the other placebo, and after multiple months of data gathering they unblinded the study and learned who got what and what percentage of people who got the vaccine had their period late vs. of those who did not get the real shot. 

Imagine a woman gets her period very late 1% of time any given month (once every 100months/8 years). Almost 1 billion women got the vaccine. Next month, 10 million of those women would have had their period randomly late, no matter if they got the vaccine. If they all come to Reddit reporting that, it will look like the vaccine is causing this, right? But there is no sure way to know without comparing the numbers to the control group who had placebo. It might be doubling the odds. It might halve them and actually ‚Äúcure‚Äù missed periods, and you would still have 5 million women who would claim otherwise.  

They administered almost 2 billion shots by now. Those 100 terrible stories written here might easily be almost all the terrible stories there are (or might be the only 100 out of 2 billion terrible experiences that were made public, or anything in between).

As an actual scientist with a chemistry MS and BS, I find it very hard to believe that you are in the field. Your research skills are at best scattershot and at worst essentially random.

It looks like you just typed COVID immune response into PubMed and just picked things that seemed germane in the hopes that no one would call you out.

No one with a modicum of scientific research experience would link a paper from 2012 that is about an entirely different disease. Nor would they have been unable to find the litany of previous mRNA vaccine trials (Zika, CMV,
rabies, influenza) that have been conducted as a starting point.

"Sore arm, arm was a bit stiff, just like any other vax. I was anti-vax for many years, digging into the science behind why Australia, Japan and a few other nations did infant/child vaccinations the way they did. My family has a history of minimal brain dysfunction and we felt our kids might be high-risk for neural damage in infancy. When my kids were three, they got vaxxed because the risk for brain injury was acceptably low. I was never like the antivax folks that get all the press now, it was just do8ng things the way other countries did.

That being said, these MRNA vaccines, according to everything I have read, are an anti-vaxxer's dream. No chemical additives or poisons, no adjuvants, no human tissues or stem cells, and the RNA message comes from a harmless, ubiquitous bacteria. It's a brilliant design solution with super minimal risks as far as we know.

Well, remember if you do have a strong response to the second shot, (which I did it was basically a flu for 36 hrs) it means that your body is recognized that Spike protein which means you've already got antibodies inside, so that's great news and your body is just reacting to those fake ones that your cells are making as if it's an invading pathogen. It's learning and mak8ng an even more robust d3fense while we feel sick. None of that really is bad, it's just unpleasant.

It may raise your body temperature and you might get achy and fatigue is almost certain. All those other things that go along with your body's response to a pathogen.

"This is a stupid article and highly misleading in what they are implying.  ARR is a function of time of trial and background risk during the trial as is NNT.  If this trial were conducted at the beginning of the pandemic when case counts were low, the ARR would be extremely small.  For instance, if the trial were conducted in North Dakota in June, ARR would be very low, NNT would be high.  If the trial was conducted in North Dakota in November, the ARR be high and the NNT would be low.  Another example would be measles.  It was virtually guaranteed that a person would get measles prior to the vaccine.  NNT was essentially 1 for infection and AR was nearly 100% for children.  Once the vaccine is introduced, the numbers start to drop as vaccine herd immunity takes hold, and ARR drops dramatically and NNT increases.  Does that mean if we stop using the measles vaccine that the AR remains the same?  No.  It'll go right back up unless measles is eradicated.

Page 47 of this Moderna assessment report references a rat study on biodistribution which states:

""Concentrations of mRNA-1647 were quantifiable in the majority of tissues examined at the first time
point collected (2 hours post-dose) and peak concentrations were reached between 2- and 24-hours
post-dose in tissues with exposures above that of plasma. Besides injection site [muscle] and lymph
nodes [proximal and distal], increased mRNA concentrations (compared to plasma levels) were found
in the spleen and eye. Both tissues were examined in the frame of the toxicological studies conducted
with mRNA-1273 final vaccine formulation. Low levels of mRNA could be detected in all examined
tissues except the kidney. This included heart, lung, testis and also brain tissues, indicating that the
mRNA/LNP platform crossed the blood/brain barrier, although to very low levels (2-4% of the plasma
level). Liver distribution of mRNA-1647 is also evident in this study, consistent with the literature
reports that liver is a common target organ of LNPs.""

I am not qualified to tell you whether that means what I think it means, which is that the synthesis of spike protein is not localised to your arm muscle. So I would very much appreciate someone with the right scientific background coming along and clearing this up, because it concerns me.",npwtmc,2021-06-01 19:52:53
"> Also does it give your cell protein spikes only if you caught Covid? Will the cells return to normal after the virus is killed?

The vaccine infects some cells pretty much the same way as a virus would. Those cells get spiky and will be killed if they can't fix themselves. 

Muscle tissue is a bit odd since it doesn't have cells in the normal sense. Cells merge together to form very long fibers, which can be spliced and replaced.

And liver tissue is *even better* at replacing damaged cells than muscle tissue is. So in those tissues the most likely body response is to kill the infected cells, cut the infected muscle fibers, and replace them with new ones. 

The result of killing cells is that you'll have cell bits floating around until they're cleaned up. That explains muscle pain at the injection site and swollen lymph nodes downstream. They hurt because of inflammation, inflammation allows the immune system's cleanup cells to get into the tissue and remove the debris. 

Sometimes people have inflammation elsewhere, either after Covid or after the vaccine. It's not completely clear what causes this, but it's probably a clean-up response that gets a little too enthusiastic. Whole body inflammation means lots of weird symptoms, usually *not* severe, but they can be extremely annoying.",npwtmc,2021-06-01 21:14:48
mRNA is gone from the body within a few days.  The half life of mRNA in human cells is around 10 hours.  The mRNA is localized to your muscle (site of infection).  It produces spike protein on those cells.  There is no virus involved here.  The cells that took up the vaccine will be killed off.,npwtmc,2021-06-01 18:03:57
"**Theory(mrna):** Goes into cell. Reprograms it. Cell will produce the virus spike. Immune cells senses this and create antibodies for spike. Next time it sees said spikes (when true virus comes) antibodies destroy spikes. Virus dies.

The only tissues that remain with mRNA are the muscle tissue at the site of injection, lymph nodes at site of injection, and spleen for the Moderna and liver for Pfizer.

"> Goes into cell. Reprograms it. 

No, it does not ""reprogram"" it.  Your cells makes proteins from mRNA all day, every day.  Each mRNA strand is a set of instructions to make a protein, and you cells process thousands every day or many types.

The vaccine just introduces an mRNA strand from an outside source for your cells to use as an instruction set to build the spike protein.  So this is just one new program of the many many programs the cell already runs.  It doesn't change the cell DNA or anything similar.

>After giving cell the message, they die. 

They're not alive, it's a chemical/string of nucleotides.  The reason they have to be kept very cold is because they are fragile and ""fall apart"" pretty quickly.  They don't last very long in your body (hours? A day or two?) before falling apart.

Once the mRNA falls apart, it can no longer be used to make spike proteins.  You cells have to process an mRNA string for each and every spike protein they make.  Once the mRNA falls apart, no more spike proteins get made.

>Funny they state trials will go on until 2023 in the document by EMA I linked above.

Fully approved drugs are in trials all the time, to see if different dosing amounts of dose spacings are more or less useful.  ""Trials"" does not mean ""experimental"", just ""we're trying to learn more"".

The biodistribution of the mRNA vaccines shows only very low levels of mRNA (nearly undetectable) in other tissues after injection that become undetectable by day 3 except for continued high concentrations in the muscle tissue at injection site, lymph nodes at injection site, and, to a much lesser extent, the spleen for the Moderna vaccine and liver for the Pfizer vaccine (both of which are the body's filters).  

The goal of injecting into the muscle isn't to disperse the vaccine.  It's to bring immune cells to the vaccine.  Vaccines just don't do well once they hit the blood stream because body's innate defenses take care of them.  That's why we don't give vaccines as IV injections.",npwtmc,2021-06-01 20:08:06

No, it's not.  The vast majority of the mRNA stays at the injection site or maybe gets into your lymphatic system.  Virtually none of it gets into your blood, by design.

That's why the deltoid muscle is used for vaccinations, it's far from any major blood vessels and you want the vaccine to stay local to that muscle tissue (hence *intra-muscular* injection).

No, be design you don't want it to move around your body.

So theoretically, the vaccines can cause the complications associated with the clinical disease, at a much lower rate than the disease itself? It looks to me that the side effects being reported are also seen in the disease.

I'm wondering if I'm looking at the right part of the Pfizer EMA document, entitled ""Biodistribution of a LNP-formulated luciferase surrogate reporter"", which states:

""Radioactivity was detected in most tissues from the first time point (0.25 h) and results support that
injections site and the liver are the major sites of distribution. The greatest mean concentration was
found remaining in the injection site at each time point in both sexes. Low levels of radioactivity were
detected in most tissues, with the greatest levels in plasma observed 1-4 hours post-dose. Over 48
hours, distribution was mainly observed to liver, adrenal glands, spleen and ovaries, with maximum
concentrations observed at 8-48 hours post-dose""

This also seems to tally with a biodistribution study (I think Pfizer) did for the Japanese on the LNPs. So it reads to me as though all of those tissues will express spike, the issue of amounts relative to clinical infection notwithstanding. But of course, I make no pretensions about being qualified to know, which is why I ask.

>vaccines can cause the complications associated with the clinical disease, at a much lower rate than the disease itself?

Vaccines can cause complications associated with the immune response to a disease.  For SARS-CoV-2, the virus itself does damage that the vaccine cannot do.

>I'm wondering if I'm looking at the right part of the Pfizer EMA document, entitled ""Biodistribution of a LNP-formulated luciferase surrogate reporter"", which states: . . . So it reads to me as though all of those tissues will express spike

You're looking at the radioactivity which is for the mRNA.  The luciferase part is for the actual protein expression.  Just because mRNA is in a tissue does not mean it's going to be translated.  It needs to be in sufficient quantity to be translated or else RNA degradation/decay pathways (which are always active) just end up chewing it up before it can be translated.  Radioactivity assays are ultra, ultra, ultra sensitive.  What matters is luciferase which is the reporter for the protein.",npwtmc,2021-06-02 15:23:57
"Thank you. Excellent, so I'm asking a brainbox, which is just what I wanted. :)

Please feel free to correct me, then - it looks as though it certainly can't be ruled out that the organs in question produce spike protein, even in smaller amounts.

Are you familiar with studies/claims that claim that the spike protein itself is pathogenic and is responsible for some of the clinical manifestations of the disease itself (such as clotting)? I have two hesitancies around the vaccine, mRNA in particular - claims that spike protein even on its own causes damage (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sis1Sddzbqk), and claims that the LNPs Pfizer are using are toxic (as claimed by Vanessa Schmidt-Kruger).

What's off-putting to me a little is that it is being claimed that these vaccines are risk free, that the only cells producing spike are located to the arm, and then to see the huge and varied range of side effects, particularly blood clots, it's difficult as me for a layperson to believe that, and therefore it's difficult for me to trust that the risks are being properly communicated. If I were straight up told that sure, there are some risks, and some of your tissues are producing these spikes that aren't limited to your arm muscle, but covid is much worse, so take your pick, I'd actually feel better about the whole thing. Does that make sense? So your answers are actually helping me out, so thank you. :)

Edited for grammar and to add link.",npwtmc,2021-06-02 16:10:44
"> it looks as though it certainly can't be ruled out that the organs in question produce spike protein, even in smaller amounts.

If they don't show luciferase, they aren't producing spike protein.  Also, the amount used in the study was 20x the amount used in humans and was injected in two sites.

>Are you familiar with studies/claims that claim that the spike protein itself is pathogenic and is responsible for some of the clinical manifestations of the disease itself (such as clotting)? 

Yes, but mechanistically, the whole virus itself does a much better of inducing tissue damage than just the spike protein so I don't know if it's a huge factor there.  Look at it logically.  For vaccination, look at it logically.  Even if spike protein was cleaved and circulated in the blood stream, the levels would be in the pg/mL range rather than the ng/mL range found in natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.  For it to be that devastating, it would need to be around 2000 to 2 million times (depending on how it's delivered) more lethal than ricin!  It's just not...  

>claims that spike protein even on its own causes damage 

See above.

>claims that the LNPs Pfizer is using are toxic (as claimed by Vanessa Schmidt-Kruger)

A claim not supported by science.  

>What's off-putting to me a little is that it is being claimed that these vaccines are risk free

I have yet to see anybody refer to them as ""risk free.""  

>that the only cells producing spike are located to the arm

Because that's where the spike protein is produced.  That's what the biodistribution data suggests for actual protein expression.  If it's expressed on the surface of a cell, it's not causing damage to that cell.  The claim that spike protein itself is damaging requires secreted spike protein to bind to receptors on the surface of a cell.  That's not happening if it's on the surface.

>then to see the huge and varied range of side effects

That's the immune response.  And it's not that varied from other vaccines.  We just don't remember what it was like to get our childhood vaccines.  It's rough.

>particularly blood clots

Which appear to be more of a response to the adenovirus itself for people that are already susceptible to blood clots (they have an anti-platelet factor 4 autoantibody).

>Does that make sense? 

I think everybody has said there is a risk for vaccination.  Risk for COVID-19 is obviously orders of magnitude higher.  And spike proteins expressed on some cells isn't going to matter vs spike protein that's actually circulating and interacting with cells as in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",npwtmc,2021-06-02 16:38:39
"Is viral immunology very different to what you do as a discipline? I don't mean that to be a dumb question - it probably is - but the latest person to claim the vaccines are inherently unsafe is Byram Bridle, a(n assisant)? professor of viral immunology. He claims that the spike protein being expressed by cells not localised to the arm is what explains some of the side effects being seen. I linked the video above where he claims very recent studies demonstrate this -even that it can cross through breast milk. What I'm trying to say is that in trying to make the most informed decision I can, I haven't been listening to basement dwellers. It is hard for me to weigh up these competing arguments.

There are people saying the vaccines are absolutely safe - granted, they're probably not qualified to say so. I do remember some of my childhood vaccines - TB sucked for a day, the others were fine. I do think these have a higher risk profile than the others.

I just don't like making decisions with incomplete data. My husband got the AZ vaccine last Saturday (second dose) - the insert they gave him doesn't even mention clotting as even a rare side effect, though it does tell you to let someone know if you're on blood thinners. I take it that full approval will provide more comprehensive side effect data and its incidence? Given that it doesn't seem so far away, I may hold off until that happens.

"> Is viral immunology very different to what you do as a discipline?

I focus specifically on infectious diseases which encompasses viral immunology.

>He claims that the spike protein being expressed by cells not localised to the arm is what explains some of the side effects being seen. 

Extremely unlikely given the time it is expressed on those cells.  There's no mechanism by which expressing the protein on the cells damages the cells.  The experiments on spike protein show that you need to have the spike protein hit on the cells, not be expressed by the cells.  It needs to be extracellular.

>even that it can cross through breast milk. 

The spike protein?   It's expressed on cells.  How is it going to go through breast milk?  The mRNA vaccine doesn't go through breast milk.  https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252998v1  And antibodies that go through breast milk don't actually enter a human's circulatory system.  They stay in the mucosa.  His theory doesn't make scientific sense.  

>I do remember some of my childhood vaccines - TB sucked for a day, the others were fine.

Humans don't retain memory until they are around 3 years old.  Most first doses of childhood vaccines are given at 2 months.  You wouldn't remember those.

>I take it that full approval will provide more comprehensive side effect data and its incidence? 

It's unlikely to provide more comprehensive data.  The data collected is on the study participants.  It's extremely rare to see side effects occur more than 45 days after vaccination.  If they haven't experienced issues within 45 days, it won't be included.",npwtmc,2021-06-02 18:16:51

"I am really sorry that this happened to you.

I have Hyperadrenergic POTS, a type of Dysautonomia. I‚Äôve had it for years‚Äî since childhood and I‚Äôm 30. 

Pre-covid, maybe 1% of the population had Dysautonomia. That‚Äôs from Dysautonomia international. I would actually debate that and say that the percentage is smaller since it took me over 15 years to get a diagnosis and I had every symptom.

I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have exact stats and documentation for this. I see a specialist at Cleveland Clinic and he told me that COVID itself is actually causing Dysautonomia in a small percentage of the population. My doctor primarily treats Dysautonomia and Small Fiber Neuropathy. About 20-30% of his current patients are covid long-haulers which is pretty crazy.

I was also warned by him that the vaccines will cause a POTS flare but I was required to get the vaccines. It‚Äôs been over a month since my second shot and my symptoms are still through the roof (I‚Äôm on 2 separate meds to control my POTS specifically and they‚Äôre not doing much).

I also know people who have had seizure disorders in the past and after being vaccinated are suffering from them again.

I don‚Äôt know if the vaccine itself can cause POTS. The vaccine does seem to kick up some people‚Äôs neurological issues. You are the specialist of your own body. Don‚Äôt let any doctor or person try to tell you otherwise‚Äî that includes that something isn‚Äôt a serious problem, or that something isn‚Äôt real.

Unfortunately, this particular post seems to fall into one of the above categories.

For me though, it's just another reminder to not take anecdotal evidence from your own life, friends' lives, and especially from anything online, as ""proof"" or ""evidence"" of any wide-sweeping, generalized claims (ie: ""people who take the moderna vaccine have heart palpitations issues"").

The author or that study says something similar yet different here ..... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RNaaBcyrEo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RNaaBcyrEo)   


He also says antibodies decrease over time (kind of suspected). Articles from December speculate the length of time is 6 - 8 months. That was a solid 8 -12 months with some quick searches with the timeframe from Feb - April and recently in the the past few days its been leaking out that the time could be +1 year. 

The mRNA vaccine basically makes the protein that your body notices should not be there and you are able to build antibodies as like the natural infection does. The body is responding to a specific protein. How is the vaccine different from the actual virus? Ints instructions are to create the same spike protein your body is presented with. 

I know I'm hi levelling this, mostly because im talking with people I don't know so the amount of time invested should be taken into consideration, but to me it just sounds like pharma tech stating their case to push more vaccines (I used to work in pharma so I know intentions are not always the best)",np7iqq,2021-05-31 21:40:29

That said, I've spent a long time searching for answers to why this happens to me. I took a beta blocker and it helped a lot with my heart rate spikes, basically took them away actually, but I might have MCAD so I had allergic reactions all the time on the beta blocker. When I have these heart rate spikes, it comes with severe chest pain like you couldn't imagine. And the beta blocker didn't take the chest pain away...

I *really* hope what's happening to you is less complicated than what happens to me. If you can't find any answers... you should look into EDS, MCAD, and POTS. A requirement for POTS diagnosis is that your heart rate changes *when you change position*, but this isn't true with vasovagal syncope. One of the hallmark indicators of vasovagal syncope is that heart rate jump-and-dip you've experienced. You *can* have vasovagal syncope and POTS at the same time.

Not anxiety, I wasn't at all anxious, if anything I had this huge sense of relief to finally have gotten the vaccine. I have severe asthma, as in regular colds put me in the hospital sometimes, and I've been terrified to get covid.

It was like I'd chugged 3 espresso shots or something. I took some deep breaths, waiting to see if it would pass, if not I needed to get off the freeway. I had only Gatorade since like 8am and it was around 4pm, so not a caffeine issue.

It lasted maybe 3-4 min and just went away. Very strange (I don't have existing heart issues).

"I got sick to my stomach the day after my first shot only. Got the shot around 1pm, woke up next day feeling nauseous and threw up a few times for about 6-7 hours. Then felt fine. 2nd shot was also totally fine.

But know that I throw up all of the time. I get sick to my stomach quite often, especially when I am hungover. I have also gotten nauseous my entire life when I have a fever, which is likely what did it for me. I would say if you don‚Äôt regularly vomit (and it seems like you don‚Äôt) then you are unlikely to experience that side effect, as it‚Äôs not one of the more common ones.",nq0zah,2021-06-01 20:53:56
"It's nowhere near a common side effect.

Sleep deprivation and electrolyte depletion can make you nauseous too, so you're better off eating lightly. Forcing yourself to stick to as normal a routine as possible can help with anxiety too.

And please remember that you come from a long, long line of animals that know how to vomit. Like tens of millions of years of evolution are standing by to take care of you if necessary. Which is unlikely.",nq0zah,2021-06-02 02:22:31
My fianc√© was violently sick for 12-13 hours almost 48 hours post shot.

When you get a covid vaccine they usually ask in that questionaire thing if you have gotten any vaccine within a set period of time. Moderna iirc is 1 month.

Did any of your friends suspect they had covid prior to vaccinating? I have heard anecdotally that people who had covid previously had a rougher time with their reaction to the vaccine.

I completely understand being very worried after this experience, but in looking at the additional information that you posted, they all may to have had some stroke risk, including family history that you may not know about.  I mean, they live in America, which often means the SAD diet, little exercise, high salt and high blood pressure. 

Lots of people never have blood pressure screenings, or get them and ignore them. High blood pressure is rampant in the USA and a major stroke risk factor. It killed my brother-in-law from a stroke at 50, and he was a hippie vegetarian (whose wife admitted he'd ignored high blood pressure readings for years originating from his low exercise, high salt diet and heredity).

Do you have stroke risk? Either way, I'd talk it over with your doctor, and keep in mind that Covid is a very severe and dangerous disease and your chance of getting it is much higher than the most serious vaccine side effects. A chat with a doctor will probably help a lot, as will giving it a week or so for the understandable concern to fade a bit.",np8aww,2021-05-31 22:10:43

"I took a Zyrtec the night before mine, not really thinking about the vaxx but more bc of seasonal allergies and I don't think it hurt anything. I told the nurse when I was getting my shot as well and she was unbothered by it. She also said I could take either tylenol or advil if I needed it, AFTER the shot.",npv3q1,2021-06-01 15:39:12
I avoided taking anything before and after... I figured if I am going to get it I might as well suffer for a day or two and get the most out of it.,npv3q1,2021-06-01 16:04:39
"When I got both my shots, they held us there for 15 minutes and asked that if we felt any allergic reaction coming on, to notify them immediately. They had nurses and paramedics on site, so presumably an epi-pen would have been used. 

I did state drive-thru for mine, and I took my dad to a VA drive-thru for his, and the instructions were always ‚Äúlay on the horn if you start feeling XYZ.‚Äù

I believe the logic is that after 15 minutes you‚Äôre outside the window of an allergic reaction that would require immediate antihistamines (throat closing up, lips or face swelling).",npv3q1,2021-06-01 16:37:02
"> wondering if there is any harm in doing this? Would it make the vaccine ineffective? I

Yes there is, unfortunately. I'm not so sure that it would weaken the vaccine, it very well could, but the most dangerous thing is it could *delay* an allergic reaction. Typically the pharmacist or whatever center you're going to asks everyone to wait 15-30 minutes to see if a reaction begins. But, if someone has benadryl in their system, the reaction could be delayed past the 30 minute mark. And this could create a dangerous situation of the person going anaphylactic on their ride home or something similar",npv3q1,2021-06-01 17:51:46

"From what I've read about obviously it's not conclusive and it's just based of people's experiences but for some of us who have had covid already we typically would experience a greater reaction from our first dose (although not always the case per my girlfriend just had a sore arm)

It seems people that have gone ahead with the 2nd had no side effects from it typically speaking.

But it's up to you and your doctor to decide if getting or going ahead with the 2nd shot is worth it for you.

I hope your feeling better I did notice my tinnitus did spike on Sunday but ots back down to normal.

I also did experience some brain fog, fatigue a few weeks before due to lack of sleep, stress anxiety etc not vaccine related in my case and it subsided thankfully. 

I definitely had some symptoms after my intial covid infection for atleast a month or so (fatigue, chest wall inflammation, shortness of breath) so I definitely did not want to take my chances with another variant of covid. 

So to me it's probably my body freaking out that this spike protein protein back and is still building up the immunity to it vs.  people who's bodies have never seen it before.

This is all speculation of course and there is an argument being made and in some countries it is a thing that if you've had it you only need 1 dose instead of 2.",npofzn,2021-06-01 21:40:07
"As far as I know that is only being done in some countries mainly European I know Germany is doing that and I think I saw France US as well.

However I'm in Canada and there is a good chance I'll probably need to get my 2nd dose unless they change it within the 2 month period I have to wait for it.

Today I only woke up with some pain In my left arm mainly my wrist and hand specially.

Also pain in my left calf but I had that at times before so it's hard to say of this is from the vaccine or not I can't say it for sure is to be honest.

Good news is that it shouldn't lasts much longer. (If it doesn't subside after 24h, go to urgent care, or your doctor if you can get fast appointment.)

Make sure you stay hydrated (especially if you've been vomiting/spitting up), take some electrolyte drink if you have it. Ibuprofen helps with the headaches and pains, if you can keep it down.

"Lots of inflammation with AZ. I've been hearing that from so many people. I sort of wonder if it's related to that protein spike breaking off thing. Like maybe in some cases it causes clots, in some cases you just get a lot of inflammation. I suspect there are even people with small clots that don't need medical attention (body just reabsorbs) but it'll likely be years before we know definitively.

In your case, did they do a platelet and d-dimmer test? That should tell you if you've got a clot concern. They can also do an MRI if that's an option, but probably not worth it if your bloodwork's fine. Watch for heat and swelling. Clot pain is intense, so if you're just having muscle pain you're probably fine. Watch for breathing issues. If you're finding yourself getting winded, that's another big clot sign. Otherwise I'd suggest doing what you can to eliminate stress. Stress makes everything worse (physically, too, like it constricts veins and stuff). You can tell its stress if the sensation goes away when you're not paying attention (caught up in a movie or book or something). Clots with second dose are pretty rare, so unless you've got obvious symptoms I'd chalk it up to inflammation.",npbwy2,2021-05-31 22:43:11

"Gonna second getting some electrolytes into you. Think of the vaccine's affects on your body as having the flu for 2 weeks. You end up dehydrated and low on electrolytes, which can cause cramping/muscle pain. It can also make inflammation worse. Grab some Gatorade or some Pedialyte. Nuun tabs are great.

"A couple of rebuttals if I may for the sake of discussion.  

In studies, Vaers has been shown to only report 1% to 10% of deaths and adverse events associated with vaccines so that changes the whole context of the discussion, especially for younger people who are relatively much less affected by the disease.  

Vaers only reports within 2-3 weeks of the vaccine and doesn't take into account potential long term effects of the vaccine. To be reasonable, the same can be said about the ""natural infection "" but the point is we still don't know the long term risks. You don't know what you don't know.  Also most of the deaths reported are within the first 3 days which strongly correlates with Europe's reporting systems in turn would at least suggest causation. 

My 3rd and final point is that if you were going to roll put a completely novel vaccine to humans then why is it that the reporting system wasn't upgraded to be more reliable than Vaers? Why aren't there medical investigations into every one of these serious adverse reports? It is completely  irresponsible to roll out a novel technology injection to humans without a robust reporting system.",nq1x39,2021-06-01 21:09:09
"dies after vaccine: ""no proof!""

dies after covid: ""100% sure of the cause of death!""

lol",nq1x39,2021-06-02 00:37:18
"Key takeaways:

* VAERS death reports only state that a death occurred after vaccination; they don‚Äôt prove that the vaccine caused the death
* Vaccinated people don‚Äôt die at a higher rate than unvaccinated people
* The likelihood of survival alone isn‚Äôt enough to estimate the risks of a disease

> In summary, the claim that COVID-19 vaccines are as unsafe to children and young adults as the disease itself is unsupported and misleading. VAERS death reports alone don‚Äôt demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccines caused an adverse event, and therefore, don‚Äôt provide evidence that COVID-19 vaccines caused deaths or are unsafe. Although children and young adults are very unlikely to die of COVID-19, the disease poses other health risks, such as long-lasting effects, even in people who only had mild or no COVID-19 symptoms.

"> In studies, Vaers has been shown to only report 1% to 10% of deaths and adverse events associated with vaccines 

How could we possibly know (a) what deaths and adverse events are associated with the vaccine vs random happenstance, and (b) that only 1% to 10% are reported?  If they're not reported, we can't know how many were not reported...right?

>Vaers only reports within 2-3 weeks of the vaccine and doesn't take into account potential long term effects of the vaccine.

Yes, that's why we have long term studies with many thousands of people in them, going back to early last year.

>Also most of the deaths reported are within the first 3 days which strongly correlates with Europe's reporting systems in turn would at least suggest causation. 

Right, because no one is going to report a death a year after vaccination.  Deaths are being self-selected because they happened near when the vaccine was administered. That doesn't mean there aren't just as many deaths happening at other times (like, say, 2 years ago).

"A Harvard study states

 Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. Although 25yo of
 ambulatory patients experien.ce an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events

 Likewise, fewer than I yo of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or
 slow the id.entification of ""problem"" drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New
 surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed.

"I think Denmark made a terrible decision with this corona passport being rolled out when so many are unvaccinated. The Danish government can only blame itself for this, and the average age for people going through this program is 33 which is squarely in the last vaccine group. I don't know how they can be surprised by this.

Ultimately for me it is health though. I get very real physical symptoms from anxiety that make it hard for me to function in life. I have had a year of frequent anxiety attacks, when the vaccines here get postponed I get another week of daily anxiety attacks. My mother was bedridden for months due to covid, and the risk of having symptoms like struggling to breathe for that long horrifies me, I can't even wear scarves too tight because any slight obstruction of my throat mimics the tight throat sensation I get through anxiety attacks. I also would regularly break down over not seeing my family and being to scared to even try without a vaccine, because I was obsessively scared of the mental pain I'd get having to cancel last minute over a positive test after being kept away so long. 

I feel mental health has been almost ignored here in Denmark regarding the pandemic, I felt like I had been drowning for over a year with nobody caring as there were ""worse problems"". So I feel I made the right choice for myself.

"I agree there has been very little recognition and support for mental health issues during the covid response.  I wish there had been, and was now, better communication about relative risks -- it was difficult to communicate about because we were learning as we go and caution is prudent.  But we did develop solid information about age-related risk that should have been very reassuring to young healthy people (I'm not saying zero risk here, just perspective), but it was hard to overcome the initial sense of fear.  Since you have taken the leap of getting the vaccine, I really encourage you to read up on how well it protects you (including against variants!)  Once you are past the immune-building phase, you can feel very very safe getting back to life, doing the things that make you happy, and seeing the people you love.",np21cd,2021-05-31 14:30:30

"The pandemic has been a lot of figuring out as we go, so of course there is only so much we can know beforehand. I have been reading up on the responses Dr Fauci and other health experts gave to scared Americans during the US pause which also helped. That and reading up about low blood platelets and thrombosis symptoms. I do not seem to have any signs of having low blood platelets but if I have any reason for concern I will speak to a health professional. 

I think the fact that this pandemic has gone on so long, mental health even in people without disorders has been rough, we hear of so much death and have to be aware of so much...it makes sense that people panicked when J&J paused after such a scary year in general. That is why I want to share my experience even as someone who is very hit by anxiety and fear. It is extremely unlikely I will travel before July, I cannot go to the UK yet due to a mandatory 10 day quarantine on Denmark (Denmark keeps showing as having a high infection rate keeping it on the bad travel list, but Denmark also as abnormally high testing).

My theory is it caused my lymph nodes to swell and dislocate my jaw and swell my Eustachian tube. The dr said she thinks it will all normalize over time. She asked me to report it to VAERS.

I know some patients have consulted their doctor or specialist for guidance. Personally I knew it was a gamble for me to have the vaccine but I also have a high risk living situation where I can't shield and thought covid would be worse so I just took the plunge.

 I'm a week after 1st dose and still dealing with all sorts of side effects but have managed to keep out of the hospital which is great (altho admittedly my threshold for going to the hospital is pretty high lol).

A little odd response if you are attempting to show long lasting immunity. 

Hopefully they can make the study and analysis more robust to strengthen the conclusion. It is going to be tough one because getting bone marrow is a risky procedure for the participants.

"The heart and digestion are affected by vagal tone which can be impacted by trauma or distruption of some sort. 

Vagus nerve and vagal tone is a part of your nervous system. 

The fact that you‚Äôre having high heart rate and it‚Äôs being relieved by bowel movements sounds like vagus nerve. 

Look into superventricular tachardyia- it‚Äôs a heart arrhythmia- benign but super annoying and causes rapid heart rate like this- look up vagal maneuvers- coughing super hard or splashing your face with super cold water. This should stop it also. If this works during an episode; it may be that. 

I was diagnosed with SVT after similar symptoms- - 24 holter found it- thank freaking God- but a 14 day one did not. So know that you could have zero episodes during the holter but you could still have it. 

I know how to manage it now but I still get episodes at night sometimes and it‚Äôs terrifying and sucks. 

How are your electrolytes?? And what‚Äôs your diet like? This is important bc if it is SVT- I can provide some other insight 

Also, look into liquid bentonite clay that you can drink if you want to ‚Äúdetox‚Äù things out. Don‚Äôt take tons- maybe one tablespoon 3 nights per week. And make sure you‚Äôre getting enough minerals and electrolytes. Do not take more than this and do not take it if you aren‚Äôt good on electrolytes or willing to monitor them

"sorry to hear you are going thru this! I had HR and neuro issues from my first shot on 4/24 that took over two weeks to resolve (you can see more history in my previous posts). My theory is that I had a systemic inflammatory response to the vaccine. The other comments in here look correct...the side effects are probably a result of your immune system getting turned on and then reacting, causing inflammation that affects various aspects of your body. 

I had my second shot on 5/26 and (so far) had a shorter, milder version of the first reaction. I went into the appt really anxious (embarrassed to admit I cried when they asked me how the first round was). I will say that the arm pain was so much more bearable the second time around, so I wondered if something went awry with the first shot because I swear it felt like the shot hit a nerve or something when it went it and the arm pain was excruciating for 4 days with shot 1. I am NOT a doctor, so not sure if that makes any sense, but I was curious if the shot could be injected incorrectly and cause the vaccine to create longer lasting, more widespread inflammation. No idea if that is possible or not...but like many others I am trying to figure out why and how this happened. 

For me, side effects lasted a few weeks and got better with time. I did switch to an anti-inflammatory diet and have been taking turmeric supplements which I think has helped me reset.

I'm aware.

>Its impossible to determine how long your body creates the proteins.

Not at all.  Your body stops creating spike proteins when the mRNA denatures/falls apart/is excreted.  The reason mRNA has to be stored at cold temperatures is because it's very unstable/fragile.  At 98F or whatever body temp is, they don't last long.

mRNA *must* be present to produce the proteins.  There is no ""memory"" of the mRNA, a ribosome has to be processing a physical strand of mRNA every single time to produce a protein.",noktlb,2021-05-31 00:27:08
"An immunologist on this sub said mRNA has a half life of roughly 10 hours at body temperature, so at 40 hours you're down to 1/16th of the mRNA left.

This is why the vaccines have to be kept cold, otherwise the mRNA denatures and falls apart before it can be injected.

I'll try to find where I read that.

For the spike proteins, I'm not 100% sure, they get attacked (as well as the cells they are attached to) by your immune system, so they can't last very long.",noktlb,2021-06-01 19:09:07

It is possible that you may be having anxiety attacks due to thinking that you may be suffering long term side effects. Now, again, it is very possible that your sides are valid.

"I understand. That‚Äôs really frustrating and I‚Äôve had the same experiences. I am not a doctor or naturopath or anything- I just know based on my own symptoms what I‚Äôve done for me. 

I‚Äôve had similar issues like POTS and dysautonomia, too. CFS, mold illness, so many issues.

I tend to believe this is either due to mitochondrial issues, some type of stealth infection, or just an imbalance from something else or a mixture of things. 

Sometimes it is hormones, sometimes it‚Äôs environmental, heavy metals, nutrient deficiencies, or something somatic like CPTSD. Or multiple things.

I‚Äôve studied so many things and the things I‚Äôve come to conclude is that the body is very complex but some things most people agree on are:

-Daily sunshine for circadian rhythm and vitamin d

-proper sleep hygiene and deep sleep

-some type of movement daily (this one is HARD if you feel like crap) 

-laying off substances like alcohol and cigarettes which deplete your body completely 

-making sure detox pathways like bowels are moving properly 

-nutritious food- not a diet but nutritious foods (experts vary on what they think this consists of) but I tend to agree with the Wahls protocol for MS which is mostly anti inflammatory, filled with 
healthy fats and lots of b vitamins, omegas, and tons of phytonutrients in veggies and fruits‚Äî NO gluten and limited dairy as it can be inflammatory for some 

-lowering stress in life if possible 

-lowering environmental toxins

"I‚Äôm going to explain this just from my point of view.

I live in the United States where we have great access to the vaccines.  Since I‚Äôve been vaccinated I‚Äôve had multiple opportunities to get it again if I had not yet had it.  I‚Äôm also fortunate to have a car, so if I wasn‚Äôt vaccinated, I could probably get one today (literally today).  So can everyone else.  

In the US, our number of infections has gone down.  HOWEVER, if you take that number and take out the amount of the population that has been vaccinated, you will find that our infection rate among unvaccinated people is the same that it was in December.  We are in the middle of a raging pandemic among unvaccinated people.  

That is critical, there is a raging pandemic of Covid among unvaccinated people.  The numbers have not gone down at all.  Why would I risk being around that?  

As a secondary reason, if a friend of mine is still unvaccinated, there is something I don‚Äôt understand about them.  They may just be frightened, or they might secretly be an anti-vaxxer, and I didn‚Äôt know it.  Once you‚Äôre an anti-vaxxer, you are dangerous because you will believe other lies.  One thing I‚Äôve learned is that nobody only believes in a single conspiracy theory.  After you make the leap to the first, more will always follow.  And again, they are probably not actually rational.  Why would I risk being around that?

Covid is actually pretty simple.  If you take out all the politics you find a respiratory disease that spreads by being around other people who are breathing.  The more enclosed the setting, the more you are around other peoples breath, the more likely the transmission.  That‚Äôs it.  That‚Äôs how it spreads.  A tight fitting mask reduces the transmission possibilities, but just partly.  Social distancing also reduces it, but just partly.  Why risk being around it?

Finally, I care about the world, and I care about my actions in the world.  I want to set a good example.  If I‚Äôm running around like this all never happened now that I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm a slight risk of being a possible vector of transmission.  Someone you know could end up dying from Covid because I wasn‚Äôt careful.  Fuck that.",nparht,2021-06-01 12:04:12
I think because the vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective and it‚Äôs more likely you‚Äôll contract a variant from someone who isn‚Äôt vaccinated than someone who is. Also the unvaccinated can be asymptotic carriers,nparht,2021-05-31 20:16:49

"I am going to humor this post with mathematics. I personally don't distance myself from non-vaccinated people because I like to live on the edge like that, and I would be more cautious of person C than B. But here is why others would want to distance themselves:

Assumption: vaccine is 95% effective across the board (ignoring variants for simplicity).

Vaccinated person and non vaccinated person together: 5% chance of getting covid if exposed.

Two vaccinated people together: .25% chance of getting covid.

Two vaccinated people and one unvaccinated person: 5% chance of getting covid if exposed.

And this is how vaccines eliminate diseases by reducing the chance/probability of getting the virus.",nparht,2021-05-31 20:31:29

As I understand it, it‚Äôs theoretically possible for viruses to replicate in the mucus membranes of your nose and mouth even if you have been vaccinated. 

Six months ago there was almost no data about COVID in this context. The data points that are coming out about decreases in transmission rate among exposed COVID vaccinated individuals would seem to be pointing toward showing this is not a significant risk with COVID.",nparht,2021-05-31 21:16:32
"The vaccine doesn't stop you from carrying the virus. All it does is cause your body to build an immune response so your body can start defeating it immediately, thereby reducing your risk of having any kind of symptoms. Your body would fight it off without you knowing. So in theory, person A can still transfer the virus. It's a much smaller risk, but still a risk.",nparht,2021-06-01 14:36:31
"Because the vaccines are NOT immunity. They are antibodies. Antibodies are what your body uses to protect itself by identifying harmful bacteria and viruses. Then the body can hopefully destroy those invaders quickly before they attack the body. All of this however, also requires a healthy immune system.

Even while vaccinated, you can contract the virus, you can spread the virus, and you can still get sick yourself if your immune system is compromised. Person A's gram is old and probably immune comprimised simply by age. 

Why would being vaccinated yourself matter if they are vaccinated? Because the virus can lay dormant in you and spread, but the vaccine can help reduce your susceptibility to have it long term and even be contagious with healthy Covid 19 viruses, instead of weakened ones or a much smaller viral profile",nparht,2021-06-01 15:56:45
">Covid is actually pretty simple.  If you take out all the politics you find a respiratory disease that spreads by being around other people who are breathing. 

the transmission part is right but covid is actually a vascular disease -- the spikes attach to ACE2 receptors and thus will attack anywhere they can attach to ACE2 receptors.

Endothelial cells happen to express ACE2 abundantly.

This means essentially that for every placebo subject that got sick, 0.05 vaccine subjects got sick.

I had my first dose of AstraZeneca in March, just before it was suspended for a while due to the blood clots issue. For literally one month I had the worst health anxiety ever. I was convinced I'm just gonna drop dead, bleed to death, etc... I also couldn't sleep and was constantly checking my legs for blood clots.
I've always been an anxious person but generally haven't experienced much of a health anxiety before covid and the vaccines. Well, this was like the gates of hell opened up and I was in a 24/7 state of mental torture.

For my second dose which is due in a few days,  I decided to mix vaccines and get Pfizer, since that's already allowed in my country. But now I'm terrified of Pfizer too. This time not about blood clots, but myocarditis and other horror stories I've read on this sub.
I have also extreme fear of catching covid, so for myself  getting fully vaccinated is the only way to get back to some kind of normalcy and stop dreading this virus. 
I just want to get this over with and am trying to focus on all the things I want to do and haven't been able to in the past year. Even very ordinary things like to get a haircut without the fear of being infected, etc.

The nurse told me I needed to relax or it might hurt more, and I explained through tears that this was the best it was going to get, and poof, she gave it to me.  

I also know that feeling you‚Äôre having after it.  I‚Äôm not a research scientist, I don‚Äôt know everything that went into this vaccine.  But I also realized I don‚Äôt technically know all the base components of any shot I‚Äôve ever received.  So I ended up relying on people that are experts.

The fact that the reaction starts early after the inoculation points to it not being autoimmune in origin but rather a generalized inflammatory response, most likely mediated by TNF-alpha.  People on TNF-alpha inhibitors do much better with COVID vaccination than those not on TNF-alpha inhibitors.   

For these symptoms to be deemed autoimmune disorders, you'd need to have activation of the immune system against self.  That's going to involve B cells and T cells generating an immune response against a particular antigen after selection.

"There have definitely been people who have gotten pregnant after the vaccine, because something like 60% of all people in the fertile age range got Pfizer in Israel by February - they had a very fast vaccine rollout.  Since a few months have passed, there are definitely people who got pregnant in that time, and if there was a big uptick in first-trimester miscarriage rates or birth defects showing up on 12-week ultrasounds or blood tests, we would have heard of it by now.

EDIT: Also, this has already been tested for in the trials: [https://www.ynhhs.org/patient-care/covid-19/vaccine/pregnancy-and-the-vaccine.aspx](https://www.ynhhs.org/patient-care/covid-19/vaccine/pregnancy-and-the-vaccine.aspx) From this article: ""Safety data reported to the FDA for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines show the same numbers of people got pregnant in the vaccine group as the placebo group. Among the 36 people who got pregnant in both studies to date, there were only four adverse pregnancy outcomes, and those participants were in the placebo group and did not receive the actual vaccine.  
‚ÄúSome women may be worried the vaccine could impact fertility, especially for those women who are trying to get pregnant right now. But the research shows that the vaccine did not negatively impact pregnancy outcomes for those involved in the trial and there is no scientific basis for such rumors,‚Äù Dr. Pettker said.""",novqh8,2021-05-31 20:31:31

It's basically a dice roll: you might not get any side effects at all or feel miserable just as you might not get any symptoms at all or go under a ventilator for weeks and die.

"You should get the second dose. In someone who hasn't had the virus the first dose of the vaccine trains your body to recognize the virus and the second dose has stronger side effects because it's already been introduced to the protein it's been trained to fight by the first dose. In people who have had the virus, the first dose reacts to the antibodies in your system and you have the bad reaction on the first dose. So you've very likely had the worst side effects you'll get, but if you don't get the second dose you will be unable to benefit from acquiring documentation stating you've been fully vaccinated for travel, work, school, or any other places that might require it in the future",nofy0v,2021-05-30 20:39:45

"My dad had no symptoms from his second shot, and he's an at risk person. My mom only had mild symptoms like a fever that lasted just in the morning. She also is at risk. I'm the only one that had any flu-like symptoms. They lasted 3 days and I was fine. I think the elderly are supposed to have less symptoms for some reason?

BUT it's worth getting done. We can go out without a mask and do stuff and be safe. The thing about covid is there are recorded cases of people who've had it getting it again. Not common, but has happened. And while the risk of having symptoms while young is low, it still is a deadly disease that has hospitals at capacity.

It's your choice of course. I was told I had a bit of protection after my first shot which I forget the actual number, but I think it's 80%. After the second, it's 100% effective at preventing symptomatic covid and hospitalizations and death. It won't stop catching covid, as we've seen with Bill Maher recently who had to step away from his late night show after having it after being vaccinated. He had absolutely no symptoms (asymptomatic).

So if you're okay with 80% (I had moderna, Pfizer may be more or less after just one), then do what feels best for you and your community. I think the goal with fully vaccinating people is herd immunity.",nofy0v,2021-06-01 14:27:37

"Hey, I it is okay if I share my personal experience here. I've read a lot of people who actually had a mild case. All my friends had a mild case of Covid, too. Some had a cough, fever. Almost like a cold. Or no symptoms at all. Then there is me. 36 years old, no comorbidities. 

I had Covid back in January and it attacked my nerves. Very rare case tho, but it can happen. I consider my pain threshold very high and I've experienced a lot in my life. Covid was on another level, pain-wise. It was a 10 day Shitneyland experience.

I have been to the hospital several times the following months, until they came up with a Post-Covid diagnosis. Some of my lingering symptoms are that my limbs go numb, that my skins feels like it's cut with razorblades, that I cannot focus even on the most simple tasks and most physical activities will exhaust me like I'm in my 80's.   

Ever since, I've been reading hours and hours of studies and cases (at least when I'm *able* to read) and to make a long story short: Every time you get infected, you roll the dice. You either get a mild case, or a moderate to severe. There is no ""I once got a mild case, my next will be mild, too"" approach. Your immunity fades over time, once it fades you can get infected, once you get infected things will either work out or go downhill.

Yes, the second shot will make you even worse. Probably for 1-3 days. But it prevents that your life is taken away from you. Even if you cannot imagine that, because it never happened to you.

This is unironically also why you may need 3 or 4 boosters a year at some point because there maybe a time when there are that many mutations running around....this is why surveillance is important.

>Do I still need the vaccine if I‚Äôve already had COVID-19?

>Absolutely. While we know recovering from a COVID-19 infection means you will have circulating antibodies in your system, we are still learning about how the immune system handles the antibody response after a natural infection. We‚Äôre not sure how protective the antibodies are from different kinds of infections ‚Äî such as an asymptomatic infection versus a symptomatic infection. With vaccination, we know that people with healthy immune systems are getting a great antibody response. So I would recommend vaccination even after a COVID-19 infection to get the best protection.

It is very *very*, ***very*** unlikely for a vaccinated person to spread COVID if they have no symptoms.

So if you don't feel sick, and you are vaccinated, you're not going to spread COVID.

>But the most important part of the recent CDC findings is that vaccinated people are very unlikely to suffer *asymptomatic* SARS-CoV-2 infections. Participants in the study who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were 90% less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of infections that did occur, only 10.7 percent were asymptomatic. Taken together, this means vaccinated people are highly unlikely to transmit the virus *when they are not suffering symptoms*. This also means that as vaccination rates continue to rise, the virus will have fewer and fewer possible hosts.",nofy0v,2021-05-30 21:49:50

This was easy because in February everyone was clueless.

I am not anti CDC although I am disappointed with them. They make a lot of ""statements"" influenced by the ""what will the public do"" not based on how it really should be, because the public is a bunch of whiney babies and cant follow guidance and makes everything political. The public also thinks only for themselves and hoards more than they will ever need. That one package of TP from Sams lasted us until TP was available again.

Added to that, in the beginning, had the CDC recommended face masks there would have been a run on PPE and the hospitals would have had even less than they did. Because again....people. So they did the best they could with locking everyone down, hand washing and social distancing because if we don't have our healthcare workers protected we are f'd.

I actually had people question me about my face mask saying it wasn't airborne. So much of the public went about not protecting their airway when they would have if they would have known. And then it became political. Living in a red state in a rural area I never entered a public place after April 12.

What should have happened is the 458048759 homemade masks that were never used by healthcare should have been distributed to the public. Im sure all of them are sitting in a basement somewhere or they just tossed them out. The workers never saw them.

I had mine in my left arm, because I sleep on my right side.

At first, it‚Äôs someone jabbing a needle in your arm and injecting a fluid.  That fades pretty quickly.  But after that, the vaccine contains either stuff your body needs to learn how to fight, or RNA information that your body takes and manufacturers stuff that your body then needs to fight.  The end result is that your body is building what it needs to fight the real thing if it shows up.  

My arm was more sore after the second, but not that bad.  It lasted a couple days , and then just went away.  It just reminded me of a flu shot, which I have the same soreness from.",np3h43,2021-06-01 13:13:11

"Go for it, there‚Äôs reason to not drink. 

As far as I know, there are two primary reasons why some medicines advise against alcohol consumption: (1) If they‚Äôre already taking a toll on the liver, and don‚Äôt want alcohol to compound it or (2) If they might cause drowsiness/loss of motor functions and don‚Äôt want alcohol to compound it. There‚Äôs probably more intricate biochem reasons for these, but I‚Äôm not in the field so I don‚Äôt know any more.

The vaccine doesn‚Äôt cause either of these things, it should be totally fine. Just make sure you hydrate properly if it‚Äôs in the first couple days when you‚Äôre still experiencing symptoms, dehydration would make it feel a lot worse.",np15ux,2021-05-31 14:59:33

"It's not prohibited, but I wouldn't go overboard (e.g., no binge drinking).  As the other commenter said: just be careful to not get dehydrated, as alcohol dehydrates you.

"Yes, I work in pharma and have experience in the manufacturing side. One batch or lot will contain all the material made within one ""cycle"" of manufacturing. So all of the vials from that lot number will have been made from the same starting material and have the same traceability. Lot sizes can vary widely from a few hundred vials to tens of thousands of vials.",np80ew,2021-05-31 18:33:48
"I would think it was in the millions.  

When the other company manufacturing the J&J vaccine had an issue with quality, they had to throw away 15 million doses that all had the same mistake.  

Covid vaccines are in high demand, therefore the batch size is going to be as large as possible.  Using Pfizer as an example, a single vial contains 0.45 mL.  There are 3785 mL in a gallon.  That means there are 8411 vials of vaccine per gallon made.  After that vial is thawed and diluted, there are 6 doses in it.  Making 50,466 doses of the vaccine per gallon manufactured.  100 MILLION doses of vaccine is only 2000 gallons of manufactured product.  

So rounding down, if a single gallon is 50,000 doses, and I doubt they make batches that small, yes, the same lot number to trace it back will be fairly widespread.",np80ew,2021-06-01 12:31:54

I had my second Pfizer vaccine 7 weeks ago. I went to bed and woke up at 2 am feeling like someone had punched me in the jaw. I had 5 weeks of horrible intense pain. My teeth wouldn‚Äôt touch and it felt dislocated. I went to the dr and she couldn‚Äôt figure it out and asked me to report it to VAERS. I also saw my dentist for an exam and full set of X-rays. The past 3 weeks my jaw has slowly moved back to almost normal, but my bite is still off. The only thing that helped was googling videos on YouTube about how to massage your jaw. I‚Äôve never experience jaw pain before. On some other groups, people are wondering if the vaccine temporarily causes lymph nodes in the jaw and ear area to swell.

"To be clear, I didn't delay taking NSAIDs for my inflammation. I started taking that once I started to have symptoms but it wasn't helpful enough because I had not eliminated other sources of inflammation (inflammatory food mainly) and was not taking the supplements that have proven helpful to me & was also not going for walks because we were under a Stay At Home Order here in Ontario at that time.

i'm wondering this too! there's an infectious disease dr i follow on twitter (monica gandhi) and she tweeted that she's going to have her 13 year old wait 8-12 weeks for his second shot to allow his immune system to calm down ... not sure if there's actual research behind this to support it though,nopb4f,2021-05-31 03:52:47
"In Ontario they are making us wait 4 months, which could be moved up to 3 months because of recent increased supply. However, you're going to soon get a lot of data. Just got my first shot and agreed to the survey, which will again shed some more light, especially with our much longer interval than the states allow.",nopb4f,2021-05-31 05:38:54
"The benefit in delaying longer would be so you have fewer antibodies when receiving the second dose. I suspect one shot was sufficient for many of us that developed long-covid like side effects from the second shot. 

The second shot was an inflammatory bomb due to the high antibodies prevalence from the second shot. Same effect as when covid recovered get vaccinated. First shot can make them very sick.",nopb4f,2021-05-31 05:43:27

Look at it like this if you young and healthy why even take the chance of putting something so new in your body? Option 1. Young healthy 99.8 percent survival rate and herds immunity if gotten. Can be treated as a common cold or for some not even felt. Maybe take vaccine later if needed after further testing. No fear of death.        Option 2. Get the vaccine early cause I'm urged to sometimes even bribed in some places and worry about blood clots rapid heart beats flu like symptom's or dying and the overall anxiety of the whole thing. Maybe to find out later down the line that opps they fucked up in this batch not saying that will happen.

"Yes but the same reluctantly you have towards the vaccine can be said about people not wanting to catch covid or be as protected as possible as well, these both unprecedented problems and solutions, came and affected all of us, with or without this vaccine, maybe the vaccine will effect us down the line maybe it will do absolutely nothing at all. No one knows.

I know they don‚Äôt want to be alarmists but I absolutely dont look to argue with peoples reasons behind getting it or not I don‚Äôt think getting an inoculation or declining it should affect simple discourse with people.

"I have experience with clinical trials.

The claim is based on the frequency adverse events occurred in subjects who got the vaccine and subjects who got a placebo injection of saline. This type of control is important as it makes it possible to determine if effects seen are actually caused by the vaccine or if they are random events caused by other factors. In the Pfizer study, the vaccine was given to 18,860 subjects. 19 subjects in the vaccine group got diarrhea after the first injection, and 19 subjects in the placebo group got diarrhea after the first injection. 1 participant in the vaccine group vomited after the first injection, and 2 participants in the placebo group vomited after the first injection. So if someone experience diarrhea or vomiting, it‚Äôs unlikely to be caused by the vaccine. They also looked for more serious effects, but nothing was found. 2 subjects who got the vaccine died. The deaths were investigated but found not to be related to the vaccine. In fact, more people who got the placebo shot died.

Overall, no safety concerns were found and hence the vaccine is deemed safe. Claims about safety is of course relative, but should be seen in relation to other pharmaceuticals. Any injection or drug always carry some risk, but there is no findings in the Pfizer study to suggest that the vaccine is less safe than other vaccines. Similar claims can be made for the other vaccines, even though the adenovirus vaccines seem to have a slightly different risk profile.",noogcz,2021-05-31 02:43:09
Can you link the source for more placebo participants dying than vaccinated participants?,noogcz,2021-05-31 04:11:38
"Thank you for your reply. So I guess my big concern is how the 18,860 people who participated in the trial were selected. Do they volunteer? Are they healthy? Are they paid? Do they represent the health of the general population? Aren‚Äôt most Americans obese, so how many obese were chosen? How many diabetics? How many with depression or anxiety? How many with underlying immune issues? Because I would think that generally healthy people would volunteer to be in the trial, not an overweight diabetic with depression. And do some of these people that participate in these trials participate in many different drug trials for compensation? And if so wouldn‚Äôt a pharmaceutical company favor choosing these people because of their history of no side effects? Because it seems so many people on these sites are reporting side effects not even mentioned in the clinical trials. How is this possible? Do they limit the side effects they look at in the trials. Like for example do they look for insomnia or because that is not considered a usual reaction to a vaccine, then it is not even considered.",noogcz,2021-05-31 03:01:11

‚ÄùTwo BNT162b2 recipients died (one from arteriosclerosis, one from cardiac arrest), as did four placebo recipients (two from unknown causes, one from hemorrhagic stroke, and one from myocardial infarction). No deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the vaccine or placebo.‚Äù",noogcz,2021-05-31 11:56:40
"For large studies like this, subjects are usually recruited through various sources. Many hospitals have databases of people that are willing to participate, but there are usually different types of postings too to reach more subjects. Participation is always voluntary. There was a large representation of different diseases. Of the 18k in the vaccine group, about 1500 had diabetes. All information is available in the study: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577 (especially the supplemental material)",noogcz,2021-05-31 03:14:10
"What that person didn't mention though, is that there is no evidence that Pfizer is as safe as other vaccines over an extended period of time.

Essentially there are two positions in the vaccine debate. Those who deem the vaccines are safe until proven unsafe, and those who deem them unsafe until proven safe. The former, like the poster above, will point out that there is no evidence to suggest it is unsafe. The latter, like myself, will point out that there is no evidence to suggest it is safe. 

Evidence to suggest it is safe can currently only exist within the 8 months trial period. Anyone can understand this, so do not question yourself on this point. So is it fair to say the vaccine is safe for the 8 month period after you take it? Yes. But it is also fair to then say the vaccine is not safe for the 8-24 month period after that. 

If you believe the 8 month trial period can extrapolate its data 24 months into the future, then you would think the vaccine is safe. 

If you do not, and want to wait for data over a 24 month period, then you do not think it is safe and should wait.  

The question really is, should what is unknown have a default status of safe or unsafe. The way i answer this question is by looking at other examples where we as a society have decided between proving a positive or a negative in determining the burden of proof. For example:
- In the legal system is it guilty(a positive) until proven innocent (a negative), or is it vice versa.
- In science, is something true (a positive) until it's proven false(a negative), or is it vice versa. 

The burden of proof has always been on proving a positive. Except! In certain cases, where that's been flipped on its head. The best example is the link between smoking and cancer.  For decades scientists and doctors, paid by tobacco companies, made the argument that ""there is no evidence of a link between cancer and smoking"". The evidence was slowly building up, but since they maintained the position that smoking was by default safe, it was easy for them to poke holes in any study which said otherwise, or disregard them craftily. 

The important thing people should know in making their decision, is that pharmaceutical companies did no invent time machines. Yes, the 8 month trial period was 8 months long. No, just because they did a bunch of things at once doesn't mean the safety period for observation wasn't significantly rushed. 

You can't untake the vaccine 9 months later.",noogcz,2021-05-31 09:46:44

"Thank you. So Over time, if a database of people that participate in clinical trials is kept, would it not become a stronger group of people. Like if there were 100 people in this database that were in a trial for drug A and 5 people got a severe skin allergic reaction. Then these 5 people I would think would not want to participate in another drug trial for drug B. And as time goes by the database of people that tend not to have reactions grows to be a greater percentage.",noogcz,2021-05-31 18:05:17

I iced my shoulder a little and took pain relievers but i still cant lift it or move it without it feeling funny in my shoulder if that makes any sense.

I also had a nodule.. was the size if a grape under the skin where injection went in..took 2 months to go away also..take painkillers and rest.

So it may not hurt for you to mention the possibility, too.",nnwu8q,2021-05-30 01:12:39

Get Extra Strength Tylenol from pharmacy in case you get fever day after getting vaccine. Take shower as well to reduce the fever.,nnwu8q,2021-05-30 02:55:46
"I put off my vaccines for several months because I was very anxious and hesitant. I also live a reclusive life style so am very low risk for getting covid. I worried heavily about the side effects. 

I got my first dose of Moderna 3 weeks ago and made a family member go with me due to my anxiety. I even waited a bit longer at the vaccination site to be extra sure. I just had a sore arm and a bit of anxiety. No horrible symptoms afterwards. I get my 2nd dose next week.  You‚Äôll be fine, you got this.",nnwu8q,2021-05-30 05:03:55
"Good luck! You've got this!

I was terrified before my first one. And terrified before my second one because everyone told me about all of the possible side effects.

Personally, I had zero side effects after the second one. The only thing I dealt with was a sore arm after both (but after the second dose, I made sure to move my arm around a lot unlike what I did following the first one). I was even able to sleep on my arm after the second dose (I couldn't after the first one until a few days later, my arm was too sore).

But I do have more peace of mind now, so for me -- it was worth it.",nnwu8q,2021-05-30 05:12:37
"I was just like you, and one of the last of my friends and family to be vaccinated. 

Had my last shot about two weeks ago now, and making summer plans and getting my life back. Feels good!

Best of luck. Try not to worry. I was too, but besides 12 hours of feeling like a bus hit me, then bouncing up and cooking dinner I was fine.",nnwu8q,2021-05-30 06:23:33

"Very nice! And it is a good idea to stay away from doomscrolling about side effects before you get the shot lol, if you're as anxious as I am it is possible to completely fabricate symptoms of anything if overthinking takes hold. Just expect maybe a day or two of feelin crummy, but it'll be over in no time and definitely worth it :)",nnwu8q,2021-05-29 22:42:41

"I had so much anxiety about getting mine! I think I was the last person in my social circle and family to be vaccinated. No one I know had severe side effects. Most did have the sore arm and maybe a stomach ache and flu-like symptoms for one day.

I had a sore arm for three days and mild flu like symptoms the day after my first vaccine. I also got Moderna while everyone I know got Pfizer. 

There were a few reasons I got mine: my office doesn't require anyone wear masks or social distance, things were returning to normal where I live and masks are now optional ""for the fully vaccinated"" ü§°, and social events were being scheduled again in my area.

I didn't find this sub until after I got vaccinated and I was surprised to find out it was mostly dedicated to people who have had negative reactions. It has unsettled me in regard to my second vaccination but I am still going to get it.",nnwu8q,2021-05-30 14:53:05
"Good luck!  We're here for you.

Be sure to stay hydrated.  Some people stress out over the shot, don't drink enough liquids, and then become dehydrated.  That's probably going to make some side-effects feel worse -- **IF** you get any.

Also, keep on eating regularly.  There are stories here of people who fasted or skipped meals before their shot, and then fainted or nearly fainted.",nnwu8q,2021-05-29 23:09:46

Many of my friends reported the same. Only a few said they felt crappy for 24 hours with the second shot.

"This is the thing for me as well. I have also become somewhat of a hermit because of the pandemic, and well, it has worked so far, because I haven't gotten ill nor have I made anyone else ill. But realising that this is not the way I want to continue my life, that I want to start going out and socialising with people, and I want the world to return to normal asap, that's the reason I am also getting the vaccine (actually already had my 1st shot of Pfizer a week ago with 0 side effects).",nnwu8q,2021-05-30 10:27:50

No one who I know personally has had any worse side effects (everyone in my family got Pfizer too - age ranges 20s-90s!). I am also a highly allergic person with several severe allergies, and I have other chronic health issues.

If you have anxiety medication, bring some with you - or do some belly breathing or mild relaxing meditations. I‚Äôm proud of you for making this decision!

Take a deep breath, hold it for 3 second and let it out slowly. Continue to do this until you feel better. Also, try not to think about what you've read here. Listen to your body and if you feel anything, ask yourself:
- What and where exactly in your body are you feeling it?
- What is your level of discomfort?
- Is it caused by the vaccine or by anxiety?

"What's even more concerning is that the 15% could be selection bias in the test itself; by gathering participants through a method not visible to everyone (ie. a poster on campus or medical records from a specific hospital), you introduce a fixed variable into your test that could inform the results.

If those who were vaccinated had a lower incidence of miscarriage, it might indicate that the vaccine improves the chances of carrying to term, or it might indicate that the sample selection process inadvertently chose women who were more likely to carry to term anyway, which is generally directly related to uterine and gynecological health (mostly genetics) and likelihood of adhering to a safer pregnancy lifestyle (influenced by wealth, career, personal behavior, and genetics).

I agree that this is a fairly small sample group, and I'm saying there *might* be some selection bias in that first study. I hope that now that we have a larger-scale rollout, we can conduct further studies with larger datasets and eliminate this bias to see how the results differ.

I'd love to see the sampling method and analysis regarding that 26% number; that's consistent with my anecdotal experience, in that it's extremely common in some areas where healthcare is either prohibitively expensive or unavailable, as well as areas where health education is unreliable or outright falsified, such as the United States.",nnxp60,2021-05-31 02:27:50

"I'm having the same thing but with Pfizer.  It's a weird feeling because it's not a typical headache feeling like you'd normally feel.  It's more like a pressure, as if someone's massaging the inside of your head.   And it's very dull.  On a pain scale of 1-10, probably a 2-3.  I don't feel like I have to take a Tylenol or Ibuprofen, but it's constantly there.  Occasional there will be typical headache pain but isolated to the left side above my left eyebrow and to my left temple area.

Sometimes when I'm doing something I forget about it but when I stop  I can feel it.   I'm 1.5 weeks after the first dose.  It's gotten slightly better since.

Sometimes I can feel it a sensation through my nose and the roof of my mouth, like it's affecting sinuses.

It‚Äôs been really frustrating because my doctor ordered a ziopatch holter monitor and I‚Äôve been wearing it for 4 days now (have to wear it for 14 days) and I felt the rapid heart rate last night again with shakes/cold/shivers and also short of breath‚Ä¶ I had tried to use the bathroom to pass a bowel movement but nothing would come and earlier in the day I had one bowel movement but it was very dry and hard

I‚Äôm drinking lots of water and peeing a lot too but I wonder if that is even helping me because I‚Äôm still dealing with rapid heart rate and it mainly happens at night time like last night it was 12:25am that I woke up from my sleep with rapid heart rate

Got none of those reactions after the second shot, although I did read that since I got those after the first shot, I was more likely to have it again after the second. But it didn‚Äôt happen.

"It really scared the everloving shit out of me though because this was going back almost 8 weeks ago when there wasn‚Äôt much of this being talked about openly. At that point I‚Äôve not heard anyone else have this reaction, so what scared me was that I have a cyst in my left breast that my breast surgeon keeps an eye on yearly to make sure it doesn‚Äôt mutate into a cancerous tumor, and I got my first shot in my left arm. So to have it a lump appear near the breast I already know I have a lump in, made me automatically think of cancer. But as soon as I hit the Google search there were a few articles that popped up that put my fears to rest. And the more I talked about this development the more I heard from other people who also experienced it. This is anecdotal, I‚Äôm no expert so don‚Äôt take my absolute word for it, but from the people I‚Äôve spoken to it seems more common in women than in men. I could be completely wrong and that may only be my experience but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve gathered thus far. It‚Äôs annoying and painful but it is temporary and for what we gain in protection against Covid, it‚Äôs still worth it. They did recommend that if you‚Äôre needing to have any imaging done, especially mammograms, wait until about 6-8weeks after your second shot. As that one lymph node you feel isn‚Äôt the only one in your body that‚Äôs currently swollen, lymph nodes are like a chain of pearls that run throughout your whole body so there are others swollen that you just can‚Äôt feel from the outside. People have had some cancer scares due to this development, so to avoid that wait on having imaging done because by the 6-8 weeks after your second shot, everything should have returned to normal size.

"Scientist here, PhD and professional researcher in the field of RNA biology. I am not an immunologist specifically but I believe I understand enough to comment. 

Plenty of reasons to get vaccinated. We don't understand  how the immune system works exactly but real world data shows us that there is likely no lasting or effective immunity: places like Manaus Brazil had 60-70% of their population seropositive meaning they have met the virus, yet they had a deadly second and third wave. Or if you want something from the US here is an example of widespread reinfection of healthcare workers: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279721000612?via%3Dihub

Antibodies are clearly dropping after 6 months. Sure you can pray to the memory cells the recent Nature publication that claimed they found some in bone marrow, however, their mere presence doesn't mean they can produce ""good"" neutralizing antibodies. Also, once your body gets infected it takes a while for the memory cells to react and start cranking up antibody production. Even if you are lucky that the memory cells are of a kind that produce neutralizing antibodies (which we don't know), now becomes a race between the virus and your immune system, and we don't know the outcome of this race. In Manaus it seems that the virus won.

It is very clear that for people who had covid-19, vaccines boost antibodies. Compared to people who never met the virus, previously infected people made an order of magnitude more antibodies. As others mentioned above, these are ""good"" neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein. Vaccination therefore makes you better protected from reinfection than counting on your ""natural"" immunity. Maybe you don't need a second dose, because the first dose is enough of a booster. So why wouldn't you want that?",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 16:43:58
"Well most of what I've read is like this. When you have covid, your body wouldve mounted an immune response to any part of the exposed virus and some antibodies are better than others. The vaccine makes your body produce the best antibody, therefore a better response. 

I've been on reddit a lot throughout this and I see a lot of people reporting that they got covid a 2nd, or 3rd, time after about 6-8 months when their immunity waned. They're thinking the vaccine will last a bit longer like a year.

Also, the entire concept of a booster is that your body mounts a more specific and stronger immune response the 2nd time. I've read that if you've had covid pretty recently, one shot should/could suffice as the ""booster"" whereas people who've never had it need both shots.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 02:16:09

"It‚Äôs a good question. I do have some understanding of why it‚Äôs important to get vaccinated anyway so I‚Äôll try to answer your question. 

Firstly, the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù in the vaccines are not dead or inactive. J &J and AstraZeneca are like getting a different and harmless virus with the spike of sars covid 2 on it. For analogy, it‚Äôs like if I came to attack you (I‚Äôm harmless by the way) but someone removed my hands and sewed Ted Bundys hands onto me. The mRNA vaccines are genetic code for the spike so it‚Äôs like if I came to attack you and just had the genetic code to Ted Bundys hands. The vaccines can‚Äôt make you sick but they do trigger an inflammatory response. 

I think I had covid last March, but couldn‚Äôt get tested. I just got the Pfizer vaccine. Firstly, I can‚Äôt be sure I had it because they wouldn‚Äôt test me. Secondly, there‚Äôs other things going on with the disease and immune system interactions that they don‚Äôt really know about much such that people can and are getting reinfected. The wild type virus, or Getting sick with actual covid, or getting attacked by the actual Ted Bundy, not just his hands of genetic code seems to muck around with B cells (antibody making white blood cells) in a way that scientists don‚Äôt fully understand. It‚Äôs probably because of some other protein in the wild virus (Ted Bundys powerful legs or something) and for many people, the immune response is not long lasting. 

Research has shown that people who get vaccinated have longer lasting antibodies and other immune cells. I think what the IS CDC is saying is that if you have had covid already, you probably just need one shot of the vaccine, not two.",nn9i0f,2021-05-28 23:52:25
"You have antibodies to your strain of COVID, not to any of the several know (and unknown) variants.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 02:13:27
"I will keep it short

Variants.

The former infection may protect you with the original virus or the one you got but there is a chance that you will not be protected against the newer variants.

There are reports of people dying or getting worse symptoms because they have not vaccinated. 

Its a way to say ""plug the holes"" to avoid future damage.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 07:36:36
"You are less likely to carry it to someone else. Just because you had it, doesn't mean you can't carry it in your system and pass it on (even if you don't get sick). It's all about stopping the trains of transmission. Getting a vaccine makes it that much less likely that you'll pass something on. Having just had covid, doesn't necessarily mean that you won't.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 05:08:48
"You only got one strain of COVID. And those antibodies won't last forever. More strains will be coming, and you'll want to vaccinate to make sure your immune system has the best framework for responding to new strains.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 11:48:52
"Because ""had covid"" means a myriad of different things to different people and it'd be impossible to make an informed public health policy based upon it. Many people were asymptomatic. That could mean anything from a flawed test (never even had it), to a very low exposure / viral load, to a great immune response. Now throw in mutations. The vaccine provides a broad based response, even having success against most variations.
So when people don't get the vaccine, it allows for  more transmissions, and hence more mutations. The obvious concern is that the vaccine will be less and less effective as it continues to mutate. That's why having everyone get their shot is important from a public health perspective.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 12:30:43

"From what I've gathered, you don't need a vaccine if you have the antibodies from Covid.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 13:44:40
"Download and read the Pfizer and Moderna trials yourself. They say unambiguously that the vaccines had no efficacy for people who were previously infected.  Not reduced efficacy, no efficacy. The evidence is also overwhelmingly in favor of natural immunity being effective and durable when it comes to preventing reinfection and more importantly, preventing severe disease. Reinfection happens very rarely just as vaccine breakthrough cases happen very rarely.

There is currently no good medical reason for anyone who has been previously infected to get the vaccine. If new data comes out in the future that is different, then it's worth reexamining the question.  

As to why the deputy director of the CDC Anne Shuchat admits this on recorded calls that you can listen to for yourself, and still propagated guidance that says the exact opposite, I have no idea. 

My best guess is its because there are so many people out there who believe they already had covid...many of those people are wrong. If the public health messaging was in line with the science in stating that there's no need for previously infected people to get vaccinated, then many of these people who wrongly believe they had covid would avoid getting the vaccine, even though in reality they have no immunity and would benefit from the vaccine. Since studies apparently show that giving the vaccine to people who were previously infected isnt any more dangerous, it makes more sense from a public health perspective to just say everyone should get it.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 02:35:14
"You've already gotten good answers, but I'll just add that part of the public health focus is to get as many people to be immune at the same time as is practical.  If you had covid 7 or 8 months ago, your immunity could be waning, leaving you susceptable again, and making you part of the group that continues to foster covid in the environment.  Vaccinating you at the same time everyone else was vaccinated is part of getting everyone to resistence at the same time, which is how you deny the virus and vectors, and remove it from the environment.

As it happens, that's probably not going to occur, because too many people are unwilling to vaccinate, making bringing your immunity current less of a concern.  But there's some evidence that natural immunity might not be as robust as vaccine immunity, and you won't necessarily know when it's dropped below a protective level, making you vulnerable again.  We know much more about vaccine immunity, and it appears to last AT LEAST a year.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 15:06:33

"I believe it is just precautionary. New data is emerging all the time, and the previous thought was that the severity of the disease symptoms mirrored the immune response and subsequent level of antibody creation. So some folks who tested positive but only had some sniffles and loss of smell may not have immunity that lasts as long as someone who experienced weeks of coughing and fever. So if everyone got a vaccine regardless of previous infection, it would at least provide a minimum baseline for immunity (say, one year of immunity-- just as an example). I think almost everyone agrees that no matter how severe your covid infection was or was not, you likely only need one dose of vaccine to act as a ""booster"".

‚ÄúLevels of T cells for the virus also remained high after infection. Six months after symptom onset, **92% of participants had CD4+ T cells that recognized the virus. These cells help coordinate the immune response**. ‚Äú

Having cells that recognize the virus that may be reintroduced with a rate of 92%+ is extremely good and shows signs of a healthy immune system. Killer T cells don‚Äôt float the body for long periods, they drop off if there‚Äôs nothing to kill. The body needs to recognize the SARS-CoV2 so more CD8 Killer T‚Äôs can be produced and sent out.

"Good question, and I don't know much about it, but if it's anything like flu vaccines then part of the battle is covering as many strains as possible? 

When you get the flu vaccine, it usually includes a couple of strains' coverage in it - the main strains sequenced for that particular year. However, there can still be strains they didn't discover and sequence (usually if transmission rates are particularly high that year), in which case even if you get the vaccine you can still get the flu.

So if we have 4 strains of COVID flying about the world currently, with probably more on the way (which could end up being drastically different mid- to long-term), then taking an up-to-date vaccine will ensure coverage of more of these strains, which your past antibodies might not cover.

"The notion that natural immunity due to infection is superior to vaccine-induced immunity is misguided and ultimately wrong. Even if you do develop immunity to an illness after infection, it comes with many potential risks. You are also way less likely to be protected from variants of the disease. 
Many vaccines induce more potent & long-lasting immunity than natural infection. This is true for COVID-19 vaccines and others, including tetanus, HPV, and pneumococcal vaccines. Many vaccines protect us against multiple strains of a pathogen, as is seen with HPV, COVID-19, meningococcal vaccines, and others.

The claim that natural immunity is superior to vaccine-induced immunity is false. This argument is an attempt at the appeal to nature fallacy: claiming that because something is derived from nature it is better. This is not true. There are countless examples of natural things and substances that are deadly. Aside from pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites, plants and substances plants produce are frequently deadly, as are other naturally occurring chemicals such as asbestos and arsenic. Even other things from nature such as snake venom and radiation can be deadly.

Human innovation has enabled us to build upon things we‚Äôve learned from nature to create better tools for ensuring human health. That is something to be celebrated, not villainized.

If you take a person with low LDL and have them eat 2 eggs a day for a month then their LDL will skyrocket. Its not hard to understand that shitty food will weaken your body and immune system even if you dont realize it. Also have you seen marathon runners?

"Now we delve into the intricacies of advanced biology and virology, and as I don‚Äôt have an advanced degree in this I‚Äôll let an expert summarize the differences in antibody production:

>	Further testing revealed that vaccines elicit more antibodies against the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) compared to the antibodies seen in natural infection. All individuals had antibodies to seasonal flu, and cold and the levels were the same for all irrespective of whether they had COVID-19.

>	Natural infection produces antibodies to the nucleocapsid and all fragments of the spike protein. The highest antibody levels were against the nucleocapsid, full-length spike protein, and the S2 subunit. Antibody levels against RBD were weak and could be a mechanism for new virus variants to evolve.

>	Vaccinated individuals showed high antibody levels against the full-length spike protein, S2 subunit, and much higher levels to the RBD and S1 subunit. These individuals also had cross-reactive antibodies between the spike protein and RBD, absent in natural infection.

"> I'm asking you to clarify what you're referring to when you say that having COVID and then getting vaccinated (and/or not having had COVID and getting vaccinated) will produce a lack of hyperinflammatory response and how that's beneficial to creating an immune response.

The lack of hyperinflammatory response allows the immune system to produce antibodies in a ""normal"" manner, through properly formed germinal center responses rather than extrafollicularly.  The antibodies would be of higher quality, somatically hypermutated, and induce memory.

>Are you basing that on the 95% efficacy rate of the vaccines? 

No.  Actual testing data for seroconversion.

>You get circulating antibodies as a result of any strong immune response, such as the response that'd form from natural infection, no?

Not necessarily somatically hypermutated antibodies.  There's a difference between ones that are somatically hypermutated and ones that aren't, both in where they derive from and how long they last.

>Do you mean that that in hyperinflammation the rate of antibody hypermutation decreases?

Yes.

>When does hyperinflammation occur during SARS-CoV-1 infection? In severe cases?

SARS-CoV-2?  Can occur in moderate to severe cases.  Generally not asymptomatic cases and the ""mild"" category is a bit of a mess.

>So what does the vaccine do to ensure 100% of people form antibodies?

5-6% of people won't generate antibodies to the vaccine.  If a person didn't generate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection, they still may generate antibodies to the vaccine as it's more directed to the RBD of the virus.  

>And what about it ensure the antibodies last longer than the naturally acquired antibodies?

The antibody titers are a lot higher for vaccinated individuals than for people that were naturally infected.  Think of it like falling off a building.  The taller the building, the longer it's going to take to fall.  Because the antibodies were formed outside of a hyperinflammatory response like seen with natural infection, there's a much greater chance that they will be formed in what are called germinal centers which are necessary to create long term memory.  Natural infection can evade germinal center formation by depleting cells that are necessary to form them.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 17:54:26

>It was disingenuous because you described it as ‚Äúdefective‚Äù, implying just something went wrong in CD8+ memory T cell production when that‚Äôs not true 

There is a ""defect"" in CD8 T cell production that has to do with MHC-I restrictions.  https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg6461 https://www.pnas.org/content/117/39/24384  This isn't new...

>when CD8+ memory T cel production isn‚Äôt the end all be all of long term protection

For short term prevention of reinfection without circulating antibodies, CD8 T cells are essential.  You can look up virus titers and see that they go down shortly after infection within the time frame it takes the body to mount a humoral response to reinfection.  

>But reinfection isn‚Äôt high. That‚Äôs the point. 50% of any given population isn‚Äôt being reinfected with COVID. That‚Äôs a fact.

Reinfection is higher than you think it is.  Reinfection requires exposure, though.

So, natural infections cause a hyperinflammatory response, which sort of cause antibodies to be formed outside of germinal centers. Okay, so that makes sense to me, kind of.

>What causes this difference between the hyperinflammation from the actual covid virus to the just general ""inflammation"" of a vaccine-induced immune response? Sorry for all the questions, just trying to make sense of this.

With natural infection, you have downregulation of what's called type I interferon (IFN).  Normally, when the body is infected with a virus, IFN is produced to let the body know it's infected with something and start the immune response.  SARS-CoV-2 directly downregulates type I IFN through multiple signaling mechanisms to evade the immune system response.  Then, when the body finally realizes something has invaded the cells, it kicks into absolute overdrive and starts cranking out tons of pro-inflammatory cytokines and starts sending in macrophages from outside the lungs into the lungs to deal with the infection.  The body basically thinks the infection is massive and the immune response is swift and massive.  This is hyperinflammation.  But, the quality of everything is greatly decreased.  It's a ""throw everything and the kitchen sink"" approach rather than a targeted response.  

With the vaccine, the immune response is guided.  There's no downregulation of type I IFN responses.  There's no playing ""catch up"" to stop the virus.  There's no macrophage infiltration into the lungs.  There's inflammation but it's not hyperinflammation.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 18:54:11

You can think of it as if it was a war. When the defending side is very efficient and successful, they'll might not need to dispatch many soldiers, and they can retreat quite quick since the invader has been rapidly neutralized.

On the other hand, if the defending side struggles, you're going to dispatch a lot of soldiers and keep them in the war zone for a much longer time until the invader is neutralized.

And let's say that when you're vaccinated, your army has been trained to know how big of a deal is the enemy, so they already have a plan to quickly identify them and how to contain them effectively.

If you had a mild infection, your army might underestimate the enemy and not take it seriously the next time they appear, or they may fail to identify them before it's too late.",nn9i0f,2021-05-29 01:09:56

">How sick were you? What was the course of your progression?

I was mildly sick, I'd say.. I was very lightheaded and dizzy for about a day and then the dizziness and lightheadedness went away, but I'd have short bursts of lightheadedness following that first day. That lasted maybe 2-3 weeks, decreasing in severity each day.  I had a mild dry cough that started about a day and a half after the first day of lightheadedness and it lasted for about two weeks. 1 week after exposure, I lost my sense of smell and taste for 1 week. Had some body aches for about 2 days in the middle of the acute stage. Had a burning sensation in my sinuses that started maybe a week into my symptoms that also lasted around 1 week. I never ran a fever, was never congested. My coughing was pretty mild overall.
I have not been tested for antibodies. 

>With natural infection, you have downregulation of what's called type I interferon (IFN). Normally, when the body is infected with a virus, IFN is produced to let the body know it's infected with something and start the immune response. SARS-CoV-2 directly downregulates type I IFN through multiple signaling mechanisms to evade the immune system response.

"I‚Äôm saying that if these covid vaccines aren‚Äôt a one time thing, and we have to keep getting vaccinated yearly like the flu, is it possible to switch brands? because i read one article that said if future boosters are needed and you already had a specific MRNA brand, then you would have to stay with that brand because the booster formula is directly based on the brands previous vaccine. granted, that article was on February and I‚Äôm assuming more developments have happened since. 

when i hear the word ‚Äúbooster‚Äù i think of an additional shot to further activate a shot you already have. in regards to the first set of covid vaccines we had to get our second ‚Äúbooster‚Äù shot with the same brand we got our first. which leads me to believe that would be the case for a third shot, or yearly booster after the fact considering each company is developing its booster shot based on its previous one. So my question is just asking if it‚Äôs possible to ever switch to a different brand despite everything I just said. I know it‚Äôs confusing, but I‚Äôm trying my best to explain. Moderna is 8% less effective than Pfizer for people over 65, which my mom will soon be.

"Thanks. It took me a while to figure out where they got that data point from. That information is not reflected in the CDC study the Yale paper references, so i had to look further.

In Moderna‚Äôs FDA filing for approval of the vaccine, they provided the 86% figure for that age group, but also cited that they had less participants of that age in their clinical trial group so it might have skewed the figure slightly lower than Pfizer.

The CDC‚Äôs tiny study of 3,950 (really 2,470 if you remove people that only had one shot of mRNA at time of the study), they found 90% efficacy for participants 50+ years old and did not differentiate between which mRNA vax it was.

Really the mRNA vaccines are quite equivalent in the protection they offer, so I don‚Äôt think you should worry about that part of it.  

By the time we are due for boosters we should have more specifics on whether we can cross between vax brands or types.  Pfizer and Moderna continue their clinical trials with the original cohort, testing antibody levels and releasing data every couple of months to see when it deteriorates. My recollection of the last report I read was 8 months after shot #2 the antibodies were still at a very robust level.

>**Symptoms of CVST occurred between six and 15 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV.2.** Eleven patients presented to their respective clinics with headache, and one patient initially had back pain and later developed headache.

After resumption, six more CVST cases with thrombocytopenia were added (as well as three non-CVST thrombocytic syndromes).** The first twelve sinus thrombosis cases after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination from the USA have now been presented by a team led by Isaac See from the US health authority CDC in the specialist journal ""JAMA"".

"Yes, we've all read the same papers on hypotheticals.  What you're ignoring is that the mRNA is single stranded (so TLR3 is out) and base pair modified, dramatically reducing other TRL and PRR signaling.  RIG-1 is a PRR but induces type I IFN.  IFN-gamma is type II.  MDA5 recognizes dsRNA and also activates type I IFN.  

It's not particularly a plausible explanation.  A better explanation for type II IFN upregulation is the spike protein itself which is known to induce IFN-gamma through T cells.  

Is it the explanation for anaphylaxis?  No.  Not at all.  IFN-gamma is not necessary for anaphylaxis from hornet stings.  You need an autoantibody from the start for the reaction.  If you don't have that autoantibody, you don't have anaphylaxis whether you have increased IFN-gamma or not.

When the vaccine first was released for emergency authorization,  they told people not to take it if you plan on having kids (which now their changing that up) clearly it is messing with how our baby making works tho.",nngvw9,2021-05-30 00:55:26
"I was on the last day of my period when I got the first Moderna vaccine. I then got my period again about 2 weeks later and it was heavier than I ever experienced in my life (e.g going through those thick nighttime pads every 3 hours or so) and I had it for 8 days instead of my usual 7.

"Wow. 43/F here, your neuropathy is almost exactly what I'm experiencing, and with no known cause currently (just got my referral to a neurologist yesterday, but for migraine management. That said, this is item #1 on the list to discuss with them).

So, I've always had intermittent ""skin crawlies"" at various points during my cycle (usually ovulation and PMS), but ~~about a month~~ two weeks after my second Moderna dose I started getting what felt like electric shocks, mainly on my head/scalp, but occasionally in my extremities. Right now, it feels like I itch all over. The electric shocks are super painful but brief and seem to happen only when I'm asleep. It doesn't seem to be trigeminal neuralgia because they're not on the side of my head/jaw, but instead on my scalp/temple areas mostly. Super uncomfortable, regardless and I'm starting to get really frustrated with the constant itching/skin crawling/zapping all over.

Follow up question for you, u/Competitive-Pea-339: Do you have a history of migraines or something similar? I'm honestly wondering if the vaccine triggers existing neurological disorders to some extent, but no one seems to be reporting on it (honestly, this sub is the only place I've seen it brought up, like two or three times). And of course, I'm getting the ""well, you're a woman AND over 40, so maybe you should stop drinking and lose weight"" answer from my doctor.

Hope you feel better soon!

edit: went back and checked my calendar to see when I first experienced the ""head shock"", and it was almost exactly 2 weeks post-2nd shot (April 7). The less painful and constant zapping/tingling/skin crawling all over sensations started shortly thereafter. I've been tracking them to my cycle as best I can (partial hysterectomy a few years ago makes this an imperfect science), but they really don't seem to be tied to it.",nn012x,2021-05-28 18:47:48
"This is so helpful for me! I've experienced debilitating neuropathy, mostly in my feet (pins and needles, extreme burning, etc) off and on since my second Pfizer dose and I finally noticed that it was the worst right before my cycle so I came to the conclusion that it was hormonal but could never find any information to back up that theory. I started taking several anti-inflammatory supplements (turmeric, ginger, garlic, bioperine, black seed oil, pine bark extract) and ever since, the neuropathy pain has barely been present at all which confirms for me that it is indeed caused by inflammation.

I've actually been feeling a TON better in every way since taking those supplements, as I had other side effects from the vaccine as well, so I highly recommend them for anyone who suspects they have too much inflammation.",nn012x,2021-05-29 00:04:57

"Definitely would suggest all things anti inflammatory. Vaccines cause inflammation- not saying this is right or wrong- it causes an immune reaction which is inflammation. Sickness causes inflammation, too. Even exercise or stress. This is normal but getting stuck in it is not. You‚Äôre looping because of something (who knows what) but further inflammation will make it worse. Control what you can control. I would focus on cutting out inflammatory foods, eating and drinking more anti inflammatory options. Turmeric and saffron are good choices. Proper sleep, Rest, sunshine, and more hydration. I would look into mitochondrial support, too. I love magnesium, ALA, acetyl l carnitine, and coq10. B vitamins may help with the peripheral neuropathy also",nn012x,2021-05-28 17:07:00

I could barely type or play video games due to the pain. Luckily it seems like it‚Äôs a peripheral nervous system issue and not anything central.

"""It mostly peaks around Ovulation and my menstrual cycle""

I have neuropathy/inflammation from my first Pfizer shot and have noticed this for myself as well. My reaction was delayed but seemed to start with the arrival of my period on April 23rd and continued until the middle of May. I am still on the fence about getting the second Pfizer shot (but thankfully, am not scheduled until the end of July for that so I have time to decide) & suspect I may have an overactive immune system & some kind of undiagnosed autoimmune issue. It has taken just over a month to get back to feeling somewhat ""normal"" again after the first shot because my body flipped out so hard afterwards.

I've found that eating an anti-inflammatory diet, going for walks when I have the energy to & fish oil supplements have really helped bring my inflammation down (and have also lowered my neuropathy symptoms which seem triggered by the inflammation). I am slowly recovering & seem to feel better week by week. It's been 50 days since my first shot.",nn012x,2021-05-28 20:53:08

"I'm 2 months out from my first Moderna shot. Within a few minutes of the injection, I felt a lump in my throat and then a wave of tingling enveloped my mouth and radiated into my nose. To make a long story short, the tingling or prickling sensation never went away. It peaked in intensity around around week 3-4. Around the same time, I started getting muscle spasms or twitching around my chin area and lower part of my cheeks. I thought it was anxiety/psychosomatic and that it would go away. I didn't consult a doctor until a month in. I talked to an allergist who said that he had heard of similar complaints but he didn't think it was a true allergic reaction, and that it had more to do with my immune system. I got prescribed some corticosteroids (prednisone). I took them, and I want to say that they gave me some symptom relief. But it was only for five days...

So here I am with pins and needles in my mouth and some annoying twitching. I feel too embarrassed to push for a work up since it admittedly sounds so mild and I can already hear the docs saying it's anxiety. If you weren't helped with your much worse symptoms then I have zero expectations of being helped with my own symptoms.  I wish I could do something. But I don't know what to do.

"Cause of death is complicated, and it's sometimes hard to attribute death to a single factor. If a lung cancer patient succumbs to pneumonia, did they die *with* lung cancer or *from* lung cancer.

Assume a COVID patient succumbed to a pulmonary embolism. Did they die *with* COVID or *from* COVID? Was the PE caused by the underlying COVID? It's likely, but it's often hard to prove.

From a medical perspective, the question is not very relevant. Still, debating the distinction between *with* and *from* seems very popular with COVID skeptics that wants to downplay the mortality of the virus.

I got my first dose of Moderna in February and was a week late. Second dose was in March and I had a normal period in April, but now it's wonky. It seems like it's just a side effect of our bodies reacting to it.

I've been reading that some people have missed multiple periods in a row after getting vaccinated so it seems to be a waiting game. 

If you're really concerned, it might be worth checking it out with a professional. There's many options if you can't afford your main doctor. Do you go to school? Maybe there's a nurse on duty you can talk to? Where are you located? I'm in the US and we have Planned Parenthood and walk in clinics that is usually low cost.

"I have never seen another person except myself who has had a bad reaction beyond the normal side effects. I had myocarditis and posted about it on this subreddit. I hope y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think mine was fake, and if mods request I can send proof. 

A lot of people who heard my story simply want to learn about my experience. They see this thing on the news, but often don‚Äôt hear the personal stories. I think this subreddit does a really good job at filling that knowledge gap. It is one thing to see the term ‚Äúmyocarditis‚Äù on the news; it is another to hear from people who had it. Further, it is medically useful to a lot of people - if someone is having chest pains/shortness of breath as a reaction to Pfizer 2nd dose, then they should see a medical professional as that is not a normal reaction. 

I have seen many responses to my post which I don‚Äôt think are healthy. These posts are not good for people deciding if they should be vaccinated. Anecdotes in general are bad for decision making, especially since the worst anecdotes are the ones most heard. The last thing I would want is for my post to influence a medical decision.

Thanks for making a space like this available to the community.

Now to some constructive feedback about your post:

>Like others have pointed out, a lot of these stories are false anecdotes that are there purely to scare people into not getting the vaccine. Notice how 1 week it‚Äôs everyone talking about late periods and now all of a sudden everyone has Myocarditis? Where were all of these people with this things 3 months ago‚Ä¶ 6 months ago?

You calling the stories of women with changes to their cycles and hormones ""false anecdotes"" and that they are purely here to scare people to not get vaccinated... well... is quite the serious accusation. I don't know if you are aware, but there's been an influx of people finding out about this subreddit, and also getting vaccinated somewhat recently.

The changes to women's periods is [an adverse effect that's being reported all over the world by thousands of women, it's not a false anecdote](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56901353), and you are not in the position to know the intentions of the women who have posted their stories and comments on the sub. Just because you haven't had the issues that these women have, doesn't make their stories any less credible. You should really think about how you word your post because you are actually victim blaming individuals here if the stories are authentic. Imagine how scared women who had no idea that this could even be an effect, are, when they miss their period and think they may be pregnant or have other issues. Also, why did so many women come out years ago when ""Me Too"" movement happened? Are you the type of person to doubt their stories and call them false anecdotes because the women were coming out in masses months and years after they had been assaulted, and didn't come out right away? You need to be sensitive about these topics and you are being extremely disrespectful towards women who had these symptoms happen.

When it comes to myocarditis, it's a rare side effect, yet we've seen 3-4 stories from OPs who have years old Reddit accounts and many of them seem quite trustworthy. One of them was a woman who had posted pictures of her daughters art on her profile months ago, and identified as a early 20s female on r/relationshipsadvice post 7 months ago. Now she shared her story, her troponin levels that were 5 times higher than what doctors look for when someone is having a heart attack, and there was really nothing about the individual or the story that didn't add up.

One of the other individuals was a younger gentleman from Germany, and he even shared a picture of his troponin levels from documentation that the hospital have him. 

All this is to say, you seem to be dismissing quite credible stories because you don't think they are real. Just because you think something, doesn't mean that your view is right.

The side effects that are dangerous are rare, but they happen. Stop spreading such dangerous narrative that I quoted you from earlier, soon no one in the sub is going to be taken seriously and this place will become polarized and actually toxic if we can't give people the respect they deserve.",nn5sbj,2021-05-28 21:07:17

"Thank you for this post. A few bullet points:

* Firstly, massive personal respect to you and all paramedic/EMTs. You are true frontline heros and criminally under compensated for the life saving and dangerous work you do.
* Fortunately, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find many suffering from vaccine side effects calling 911. They are in the shadows at PCPs or urgent care.
* We‚Äôre seeing this influx now because more of the younger population are receiving vaccines and the lag associated with rollout, second shot delay, and confused victims coming to terms with the unexpected debilitating symptoms they are now forced to confront. 
* My covid-like side effects were not expected based on what I read from official and best sources, published trials data. 
* After being very diligent NOT TO contract the disease for more than a year, I‚Äôll admit my vaccine side effects have left me frustrated and distrustful of official sources.
* I was never vax hesitant. Got mine before my age group was even eligible. 
* Until it‚Äôs reported by official sources or credible media outlets, it‚Äôs fake news or anti-vaxxer propaganda. This includes honest people like many of us experiencing side effects.
* I wasn‚Äôt aware of this forum until after my 2nd shot and long term side effects developed. I found this place, of all places, on Infowars.com. A site I frequent no more than once every six months for a cheap laugh.
* Many have correctly pointed out this sub doesn‚Äôt provide the vax hesitant a realistic sense of the risk or probability of developing the adverse side effects reported here. That‚Äôs not what the forum is for. It‚Äôs has developed into an ad hoc ‚Äúsupport group‚Äù.
* The existence of this sub illustrates a problem. These vaccine side effects are not described in official disclosures. I have a real problem with this because it violates informed consent. 
* I‚Äôve talked to six doctors. They all said unprompted that they are seeing a lot of patients with vaccine side effects. All young and healthy.
* We don‚Äôt know the statistics because there is no data available. We are left with anecdotes. 
* This is the consequence of pushing out a novel vaccine for a novel virus without long term safety data. 
* The official govt policy decision was to mass vaccinate the entire population as quickly as possible. The risk of unknown long term side effects substantially outweighed by the objective of reaching heard immunity.
* There is overwhelming society wide peer pressure to vaccinate. Vaccine side effects victims are hesitant to speak out. Many are not believed, or their side effects are dismissed as coincidence or anxiety. I‚Äôve experienced this.
* Vaccine side effect victims have become yet another class of pandemic casualty because they‚Äôre inconvenient to the prevailing narratives.
* There‚Äôs no treatment options. Victims and their doctors are left to improvise within an increasingly restrictive and costly medical system. 
* Based on the trials data, long term would seem to mean a few days post vaccination. Certainly not weeks or months. Statistically, if only 1 in 10,000 have these side effects, these effects would not have manifested within the dataset as the studies lack statical power with only 30,000 participants. 
* This data is accumulating now and will be disclosed on a schedule of their choosing. Deferred as long as possible to mitigate creating vaccine hesitancy and as long as possible, again reasoning, the benefits are outweighed by these side effects?
* At a rate of 1:10,000 (for example) that means there will be 15,000 in the under 40 us population that will experience adverse side effects. About 9,000 people under 40 have died of COVID-19 per CDC. Perhaps this side effect risk is worth it.
* I have found a number of news stories on disrupted menstruation cycle.
* Finally, I believe there is link between long-covid and vaccine side effects, and we should be permitted to openly discuss potential treatment options. Unfortunately, social media companies has made censorship their mandate and will suppress any discussion of treatment. I‚Äôll remind you there is no public acknowledgment of such side effectS, much less a treatment. What are we to do?",nn5sbj,2021-05-29 01:38:33

"I appreciate the subreddit a lot. I visited a few days prior to my 1st Pfizer shot. I came back a few days later because I had an odd ""side effect"". I developed a tension headache that's still lingering but much better. I remember seeing a few posts about similar headaches and it honestly eased my mind. Still, I checked with my doctor, even had an MRI and it was all clear. Was it the vaccine? Maybe, maybe not.

It's important to listen to your doctor above else. I'm noticing a recent trend of ""doctors don't know either"". It's not true because doctors can check for life threatening issues no matter what the cause. The origin of certain odd symptoms is harder to pinpoint but that's not new. I had a major health issue in 2012 and doctors weren't really sure what caused it.

I also agree there's a trend that when a new side effect breaks the news there's a flood of posts here. Myocarditis has been the obvious one. I'm not saying these posts are fake but all this info can contribute to freaking out about stuff. Once again, as an example, I had a major heart scare in 2019. Doctors ran tests and prescribed magnesium. I've been having some minor heart issues since my 2nd dose as well, which most would be quick to attribute to it but my experience in 2019 just reminds me to go check with my doc.

And there has definitely been a flood of comments/posts coming from conspiracy subreddits. I see some good recommendations here on how to improve sub but I'll keep telling people just listen to your doc. If you don't fully believe they're right, get a 2nd opinion. Take everything from Reddit with a HUGE grain of salt.

Edit: I forgot to add that I'm the only one from my family (in 3 countries) and from a very large company who has had any lingering or odd side effects.",nn5sbj,2021-05-28 23:11:21

Other side effects are just not common. 

On the flip side, we have seen many, many covid related deaths or near deaths, including a physician that was on ECMO for weeks and then in rehab for months. We started out with part of the ICU remodeled for covid patients and have expanded the covid zone so many times because of overcrowding it now has its own floor in the hospital. It's now much improved from the worst points we saw last year and hopefully continues to get better as more people get vaccinated",nn5sbj,2021-05-30 07:07:08

-The karma ratings of posts/comments can be hidden for a certain amount of time to dissuade brigaders. Really, the most important quality of a post is whether or not it‚Äôs informative or helpful. I have seen subs hide karma from a couple of hours to an entire day.

-Guidelines for posting would be great. Posts with no context benefit nobody. Asking for info like age, sex, vaccine type and (to a certain extent) health info would help us all be more informed.

-A daily/weekly thread dedicated to vaccine experiences since these types of posts are extremely common and the low effort posts make the sub feel especially bloated at times.

-Comments can be automatically sorted by new instead of best. This paired with a period of hidden karma would lead to less biased responses.

"Unfortunately issues like this are so much more simple when they're imagined as binaries, as black and white, when the reality is unimaginably more nuanced.  It's simply so much easier to blame everything on a vaccine, or even spiral into conspiracy theories, than to recognize vaccines have excellent safety profiles.  On the other side, it is just as easy for those with scientific fetishes (those who assume we know enough about the human body to make absolute, law-like generalizations about vaccines in the same way we can about the laws of physics) to filter out those who really are having an atypical averse response to the vaccine.  Both these extremes increase conspiracy theorizing, premature scientific triumphalism, and general acrimony.  Both extremes are much easier to live with than the general discomfort of limited knowledge and the extreme complexities of the human body.

"I agree with your points very much. Not everyone asking about how safe the vaccine is or sharing their bad vaccine side effects are fake or ""anti-vaxxers"". In the first place, vaccines should never have been politicized in the first place. I often see on social media people condemning anyone with questions as ""republicans"" or ""conspiracy theorists"". Where do people with valid questions and real bad experiences go?

Censorship is definitely not the answer. The main point of science is to find the truth, and you can never get the truth if you keep censoring things.

When I got both of my Moderna shots from CVS, the officially listed side effects were only the common ones like headache, chills/fever, and the ""covid arm"". I don't ever remember seeing the random heart palpitations, loss of balance, breathing problems, tinnitus, numbness of limbs, and menstrual issues listed. I'm now 6 days past shot #2 and I still have breathing problems and balance problems so  I can't lie down on my back because breathing kind of hurts/hard and I have to sleep sideways. Strangely I never had loss of balance on shot #1.

Vaccination shouldn't be treated like it's some kind of team sport battle where there's Pro and Anti. People should be able to get as much information about the vaccine as possible, both from official sources AND other real people's experiences. Yes, verifying real experiences is probably unrealistic due to how hard it would be to do, but waiting for official statements about other unlisted side effects obviously take long because they'll have to seriously verify everything, you can't just add one to the list without proper evidence. Despite this, I personally believe that censorship does more harm than good, because it silences valid questions and experiences. Censorship is similar to punishing a suspect right away without trial, guilty before being proven innocent, and this can potentially hurt actual innocent people. Instead, when it comes to shared experiences by other users, we must make our own decision whether or not to believe them. Does the person seem suspicious? Does the person seem to only repeat what others have said? Does the person's account seem like it's a real one that's being used normally or it's just a fake shill account? Of course there's no way to always be right with our conclusions in this type of thing, but if we keep censoring people, we could be potentially censoring the truth.

In short, official sources usually are not malicious, since official health statements come from the scientific method. For people's stories, you'll have to be smart and decide on that yourself. My personal opinion though, is that most people don't lie about side effects, especially since most people are simply afraid and looking for support or looking for someone else with similar experience. The coronavirus situation and the vaccine's effects are all new to us, so it's simply human nature to be scared and want to share and learn more information about it. Censorship is never the answer.",nn5sbj,2021-05-29 23:08:10

My prediction is that the dose of the vaccine is too high for younger people. The dosage is chosen to have a high probability of good immune response.

>The point to be taken is that the stories shared on this subreddit should 100% be taken with a grain of salt.

I fully agree with this. I think at times we may need a salt lick instead of just a grain of salt too! When someone posts serious side effects that were diagnosed at the hospital, I like to stalk through their profile, look at their post and comment history, and see what kind of individual they may be based on some of their earlier comments years ago and also what subs they frequent. Surprisingly, most people that posted adverse side effects had... very normal and very authentic seeming profiles with no history of unusual posts or seeking attention. They seemed like very normal and functional people. I mention this, because instead of expecting xx% of stories to be false, it's better to look at it case by case basis and in some ways give the benefit of doubt in favor of OP. You know, unless something actually seems off, why shouldn't we believe them? We surely believe the positive stories here and don't think that they are false anecdotes. There's going to be a huge amount of sampling bias in the sub because people with negative reactions are much more likely to share their stories than the ones who had no issues whatsoever. That's not a bad thing inherently, just good idea to keep on mind that for every positive story we see, there are likely 10 people who didn't share their positive story. And for every negative story, maybe 1 or 2 who don't share, you know? 

That said, would the mod team be open to the idea of verifying documents by OPs who share stories about serious adverse effects in PMs or otherwise? I believe this could have a huge positive impact in terms of how seriously these stories are taken, and keep spam down.",nn5sbj,2021-05-28 21:31:08
"Agreed on the autism front.   


On the risk-benefit side of the covid vaccines... it matters which vaccine and what age. There isn't a high-quality data source that can say that definitively.

This is based on moderna and pfizer vaccine. Around the world, there are vaccines from China, Russia, and India that have their own coming out soon.

When someone posts serious side effects that were diagnosed at the hospital, I like to stalk through their profile, look at their post and comment history, and see what kind of individual they may be based on some of their earlier comments years ago and also what subs they frequent. Surprisingly, most people that posted adverse side effects had... very normal and very authentic seeming profiles with no history of unusual posts or seeking attention. They seemed like very normal and functional people. I mention this, because instead of expecting xx% of stories to be false, it's better to look at it case by case basis and in some ways give the benefit of doubt in favor of OP. You know, unless something actually seems off, why shouldn't we believe them? We surely believe the positive stories here and don't think that they are false anecdotes. There's going to be a huge amount of sampling bias in the sub because people with negative reactions are much more likely to share their stories than the ones who had no issues whatsoever. That's not a bad thing inherently, just good idea to keep on mind that for every positive story we see, there are likely 10 people who didn't share their positive story. And for every negative story, maybe 1 or 2 who don't share, you know?
> 
> That said, would the mod team be open to the idea of verifying documents by OPs who share stories about serious adverse effects in PMs or otherwise? I believe this could have a huge positive impact in terms of how seriously these stories are taken, and keep spam down.

I 100% agree with you, thank you in return for your maturity. 

I think the reason that you probably don't see many cases where it is very obviously a circumvented ban account is probably attributed to the fact that we catch a lot of them early on. Which I suppose means we are actually doing some good.

It's easy for us to forget that not everyone sees the removed comments and banned accounts and you only see what's been allowed onto the subreddit. Believe me when I say that I am having to ban at least 10 accounts a day because they are brand new accounts, no history with throwaway names claiming that ""the vaccine caused me to catch covid"".

In regards to the verifying documents suggestion, it would entirely be possible, however in spirit of wanting everyone to have equal opportunity to share their stories, we fear that putting such a process in place would put off a lot of people from sharing as they would not want to give their personal medical information to strangers over the internet.

The problem is you can't take VAERS data at face value.  People are asked to report anything that happens to them after getting vaccinated, and inevitably, lots and lots of unrelated events will get reported (as they should be).

Then, it's up to statisticians and health experts to comb through the data and find the patterns in the noise.  If people are reporting myocarditis (for example) after getting vaccinated, but it's at the same rate as any other year...well, it's probably not related (all else being equal).",nn5sbj,2021-05-28 21:39:32

"Well, in Israel out of the millions of admistered doses in the non-teenager population, there was 60 cases of myocarditis, and 54 of these was after the 2nd dose, and just 6 after the 1st dose. Literally 90% of the myocarditis cases happened after the 2nd dose. And guess what Israel is doing, they are considering on giving just 1 dose of the mRNA vaccine to the teens because of the very real risk of severe side effects like myocarditis being caused by the vaccine.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/to-beat-side-effects-israel-considers-giving-teens-just-1-covid-vaccine-dose/

CDC's assessment about there not being an established link at best is wishful thinking and procrastinating the inevitable, and at worst highly irresponsible behavior when they refuse to admit the link in order to secure as many vaccinations as possible for the general population.

Also, did you forget about the individual in this thread who was willing to verify that they got myocarditis after the vaccine?

Never in history has there been a vaccine that had any adverse side effects that first show up longer than 6 weeks after the shot, because your body will have fully processed it and the immune system finished reacting by then. Vaccines aren't like drugs where often someone takes a drug *daily* for several years, and only after 5 years of continuously using the drug do the cancer cases start showing up.

The reason those vaccines were never approved is that SARS died out and there was no longer a need for a vaccine for it, so they paused the trials before efficacy was determined.

I joined this subreddit to compare my mild and interesting potential side effects -- like a headache -- to the experience of others, and to reassure myself when people like these posters get me worried in places where I stumble upon their posts, like Twitter. 

People with a predisposition to health anxiety are very vulnerable to these trolls, misinformation agents, whatever they are. It's a form of Munchausen Syndrome with some of them, as well. Basically what this means for my fellow vaccinees is that people are writing elaborate, fake stories to scare you for a variety of unethical reasons. 

For anyone frightened by this and not getting vaccinated, I am so sorry for the fear and anxiety this has caused you, and I encourage you to talk to your doctor and/or an epidemiologist about it.",nn28rf,2021-05-28 20:39:06
"That‚Äôs a totally valid question! I was also apprehensive before I got my vaccine because of this very reason, all the unknowns. 

Here‚Äôs what I found while I went down the vaccine rabbit hole:

‚Ä¢ For vaccines, they start to see long-term side effects come up after about 2 months. We‚Äôve had people that have been vaccinated for a year already and these long-term side effects would‚Äôve already made themselves present.

‚Ä¢ The mRNA vaccines might be a new technology to us, but they have been studied for  decades with no issues for other viruses like the flu, Zika, and rabies. Aside from this, they have used the technology to trigger immune responses against cancer cells in the research to cure cancer. 

I know that it seems that the vaccine was created too fast compared to a normal vaccine that takes about a decade to create, but that‚Äôs due to many factors. Funding is a big one - when developing a vaccine for a non pandemic virus, the labs don‚Äôt have the funding at their disposal for trials and for producing larger amounts of it so they have to wait a lot for that money to come in so they can move to the next phase. In a pandemic, you have all the world‚Äôs governments throwing money at you so the process gets sped up exponentially. 

Another thing is the disposal of people for the trial phases. For a normal virus, there‚Äôs a lot of waiting around to gather enough people for these trials. In a pandemic, it‚Äôs a lot easier since so many people are infected. This also speeds up the process on the testing side of things. 

These vaccines are very safe and if there were long term side effects, we would know of something by now. Everyone‚Äôs body is different and some people might react a little stronger to it than others, but the odds are in your favor when it comes that.

"My husband's family got Covid in the fall and his mother (who was in great health and 50) still has brain fog and fatigue that keep her from resuming life as she knew it before Covid. 

Of my family who got the vaccine, two of 10 member had a day of what felt like a mild flu, the rest had a sore arm for 2 days. Also, we now no longer have to worry about getting Covid or passing it to others.  We are able to have family get togethers again.  The peace of mind was well worth it for us.",nn28rf,2021-05-28 20:15:17
"One reason mRNA vaccines were produced and quickly tested is that these vaccines do not need adjuvants.  Adjuvants are added to traditional vaccines to make them more effective, but the problem is that adjuvants (and the amounts!) need to be tested.  That takes precious time as scientists would have to figure out what and how much to use.

It turns out that these mRNA vaccines don't need adjuvants because they're effective enough as-is and don't need them.  This cuts months and possibly years off the vaccine development time.

I had an extremely heavy period after my 2nd dose. I personally didn‚Äôt attribute it to the vaccine as I recently stopped birth control (about 2 months prior to my first dose) and I have fibroids. I conceived exactly a month after my 2nd dose so I haven‚Äôt had a period to compare it to but it obviously didn‚Äôt cause major issue with me cycle since I was able to conceive soon after.,nn2cj0,2021-06-02 18:28:47

(To be fair, I flew back to the US from London on March 3, 2020 just when everything was kicking off and had a weird head/chest cold for two weeks immediately afterwards.

Yep have been to two different doctors and both have told me to take electrolyte and vitamin supplements but its a toss up whether any of that worked.

I personally think it has something to do with heart inflammation which can happen with some types of vaccines and is a possible but (hidden) side effect from the covid vaccine. I am a molecular biologist but the main frustration that I'm experiencing when it comes to figuring out these things is the lack of transparent information sharing. VARES is the only real tool that we have for public data access and it's subpar at best.",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 20:13:57
"In California I have seen many posts from people I know that had racing heart, palpitations after the shot . A couple of ER mds said that they have been seeing this in people . I know two personal stories. Both got checked and 1 took second dose the other did not ..both were females in 50s range but checked out ok . The one told me the other day looking back she felt it was anxiety .  The other has no clue and believes it was shot .. so it could be a combo . I have history of SVT and my cardio said to get it but my endo said no . So I think none of these mds really know .",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 18:14:03
"Check out my past posts.  I have a history of SVT, but it has been controlled without meds.  I had an immediate spike within minutes of the vaccine, and elevated HR for a couple weeks afterwards.  I am struggling more with blood pressure drops right now more so than SVT, but I am having more SVT episodes than I had prior to the vaccine.",nmzzfd,2021-05-29 00:38:56
"Heart rate spikes and tachycardia are also caused by pure anxiety/panic disorder. I went through this for months at the beginning of the pandemic because I have a history of health anxiety/panic disorder (although I didn‚Äôt get weird skipped beats this time, I have in the past). And yes, panic attacks can absolutely be ‚Äúfree floating‚Äù and can arise out of nowhere.  I did not have any vaccine-related anxiety effects personally, but I also was happy about getting vaccinated because COVID was far more anxiety-raising for me.

Some things that help definitely include Calm/magnesium (I like antacids like Maalox), and keeping hydrated. I also strongly recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Recently, cutting out alcohol except on rare occasions has also helped. Some people do well on medication, but I never did. All that said, Even ‚Äújust anxiety‚Äù is scary and ‚Äúnot fun‚Äù though, and I highly recommend anyone dealing with this to consider seeking out a good mental health specialist üôÇ",nmzzfd,2021-05-29 17:02:23
"I have had a dull pain in my left chest, specifically my heart, for about 1 week so far. The week prior I had random but consistent heart palpitations. The pain has subsided for the most part but that was all of the symptoms I had. The pain was at 1-2/10 scale. It‚Äôs been getting better on its own and hasn‚Äôt worsened. 

No specific diagnosis but similar to what others are going through. I saw my Doctor and got an EKG as well as a CPK test to show for any inflammation signs in my blood. EKG was perfect and no call back on my labs which means good news so far. This started all of the sudden about 3ish weeks after my 2nd dose of Pfizer. 

I am still able to work out but I do have to note not to push 100% and keep my breathing in check but otherwise I seem to be healing. 

I eat healthy, I am taking baby aspirin per docs orders, and am staying vigilant on how my body is feeling throughout the day.",nmzzfd,2021-05-30 05:24:38
"I'm really sorry to hear that. How long have you been experiencing issues? For me, the tachycardia / elevated HR lasted for about 2 weeks after my first shot but slowly improved w/ time. Now experiencing the elevated resting HR again (up about 10 BPM) since getting the second shot on 5/26 and really hoping it goes back to normal again. It's really unsettling feeling like there's no answers or guidance from anyone on these issues...

Completely share your frustration with the lack of transparency. I have reported my side effects as well, but I kind of feel like no one cares at this point. I was pretty annoyed when I explained my symptoms to a colleague and they responded with, ""yea but at least you're vaccinated, so be happy about it!"" I feel like a lot of people are dismissive because they just want to get back to a ""normal"" life and don't want to have people ruining their vibe after a depressing and tough year. Basically, I feel like a debbie downer who can't get any answers from my doctors while everyone else is like...shush! we want to feel like this pandemic never happened. Not trying to be negative, and I'm really happy for those who had an easy time w/ their shots, but I don't like than many people are having their symptoms dismissed as ""anxiety"" or made to feel like they are a troll or anti-vaxxer for sharing their experience.",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 20:46:48
"That's really interesting - thanks for sharing! I'm kind of surprised that the CDC hasn't added this as a side effect yet. I understand not wanting to freak people out without knowing if this is connected, but to me it was scarier having the side effect and not being mentally prepared for it, especially with the recent news of myocarditis. I have questioned the hormonal effects, especially with all the horror stories of people who have messed up cycles. 

If you are open to sharing, do you know if your history of SVT is linked to hormones? My cardiologist has never mentioned it to me as a potential trigger but I saw some posts about how some people get SVT before their cycle, or others who had a thyroid issue that triggered it. I've never seen an endo but I'm thinking of talking to me PCP about a referral. I haven't really been able to nail down my SVT triggers and would like to have more of a sense of control over it and avoid surgery if I can.",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 18:37:40

"It's been almost a week at this point, and it's just really disconcerting because it's so different compared to what people talk about when it comes to their symptoms. Yeah, I talk about my symptoms with other people and all I really hear is ""That's wonderful that you decided to finally get vaccinated!"". Of all the people I know, I'm pretty much the last person to get vaccinated but I'm also one of the youngest and lead a very low-risk lifestyle. I work in a lab with PPE with other people wearing PPE in a regulated ventilated lab system that makes it very hard to get contaminated by anything...   


All I can really figure about the symptoms is that even if people did experience significant symptoms, people are either being quiet about it or lying about its severity to not discourage others from getting vaccinated. I have a few hypotheses as to why some people experience adverse reactions while some do not, but I don't know if that would be construed as conspiracies or not. But basically, the hypothesis is that for people who received the mRNA vaccine the vial they received had either malformed mRNA or truncated mRNA that has degraded slightly. That will produce spike proteins that won't be anchored to a membrane and be presented out to the cell surface and instead will produce soluble spike proteins that can circulate in the body and cause body-wide effects. This can in turn cause body-wide inflammation including the heart.   


For people like me who got the J&J vaccine which is an adenoviral vector containing DNA sequences that encode the sars-cov2 spike protein, it can end up producing multiple splice variants, which can also have issues with truncated spike and end up being soluble and systemic.  


Basically, I think the original design of the vaccine was for the spike protein to be presented on the muscle cell surface in the arm and have a localized immune response. For whatever reason, I think some people end up with spike proteins that are unanchored and enter the circulatory system, attach to the ACE2 receptors on the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, and cause an systemic immune response.",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 21:10:06
"You think the CDC is going to put that out there and warn people ?   There are so many I read about or know that have had it . 
I think it‚Äôs so wrong that they are hiding it .  The people I know got Moderna. I know issues with Pfizer but I know no one personally. 
I am 70 and I have had SVT since I was 18 . I don‚Äôt get it often . But no correlation between that amd my cycles when younger . I did get more palpitations amd still do but I have hashimotos and just got blood work and my antibodies are crazy high . So waiting for other tests too . Autoimmune can give you those symptoms too. You may want to get you thyroid antibodies. Lots of mds just go by tsh levels . So you may want to get antibodies checked as that definitely has a bearing on heart issues.",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 18:53:55

"I'm really sorry that you are having to go through that. As I mentioned in the body of the post, I had an elevated resting and sleeping HR, elevated HR when doing chores or trying to exercise, a few SVT attacks, insomnia, and weird ""shock"" sensations up my spine. None of the doctors I spoke to had any idea about the potential reason or correlation between the symptoms - it was really disconcerting to have them just sort of shrug and respond with ""well your bloodwork looks fine"" or ""we still don't know a lot about this vaccine"". No one has had any answers, so I appreciate that people are being transparent on this sub and sharing their experience but we need more mainstream reporting on this. I don't want to discourage anyone from taking the vaccine, but I do think people need to be aware of these potential side effects to make a decision that is right for them. 

My side effects did slowly get better with time, so I am hoping that the same happens with you as well. I have seen quite a few posts with folks who had effects for a week or two that resolved on their own, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you. 

Your theory makes a lot of sense to me (I do not work in the medical field but the storage requirements make me wonder what kind of quality issues we could see). I was wondering if there was something could go wrong with the actual injection itself - someone had mentioned the possibility of injecting into a blood vessel instead of the muscle? - but I don't know if that theory makes sense. I will say that the arm pain I experienced with the first does was about a 12 out of 10 and was worse than my worst menstrual cramps (sorry TMI, but I've had a history with bad ones) and the NSAIDs did nothing for it. For the second shot arm pain was more in line w/ what I expected (say a 6 out of 10 that was helped by Tylenol). I'm wondering if my severe reaction to the first shot had something to do with the way it was administered or - to your point- maybe a bad batch situation. I definitely encourage you to share your story and thoughts on this - it helps people like me who are looking for answers feel a little less alone. 

p.s. I have really grown to hate the ""CONGRATS! You got vaccinated! How wonderful!"" rhetoric because these are legit scary experiences for people and its not so wonderful to deal with the side effects.",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 21:25:52
"Thanks for the advice. I have been suspicious for a while that I have thyroid issues, but whenever I get the bloodwork done (and I even got an ultrasound), everything comes back normal. I'll look into finding a good endocrinologist to do some follow-up. Really appreciate you sharing your experience!",nmzzfd,2021-05-28 19:01:34
"So... about the stability of the vaccines.  
Both the pfizer and moderna vaccines have to be shipped frozen. Pfizer has to be shipped on dry ice and stored at -70C. This is because even if the mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, they are highly unstable and degrade on their own without any help from enzymes that degrade them (Such as rnases).  They use modified nucleotides that are supposed to be more stable, but the clock starts ticking as soon as it starts thawing. But modified nucleotides can cause toxic effects if given repeatedly at high doses.  This is a news article about Moderna back in 2017 when they hit a wall as their mRNA vaccination technology was causing unacceptable levels of toxic reactions in their patients. [https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/10/moderna-trouble-mrna/](https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/10/moderna-trouble-mrna/)  


How the vaccines are thawed whether it be at room temperature or in the refrigerator affects its stability, and the Pfizer vaccine cant stay at room temp for more than 2 hours total and can't be refrozen. Their IFU has almost a page about how to store, what temp, how long, etc etc.

https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download

J&J vaccine uses an adenoviral vector containing DNA sequences so it's more stable and can be shipped at refrigerated temperatures. 

For the injection, it really felt like I was getting injected with some kind of acid. It burned on the way in and burned when they pressed the plunger down. My arm felt quite painful for several days. I got stabbed in the arm once before and the injection hurt way more... although the stab left a scar, while the injection did not, haha.

It *is* a vaccine side effect, however it is interesting to note that in the trial data the amount of people who experienced nausea & vomiting from the vaccine are very close to the same amount of people who experienced it from the placebo. 

 It could be some sort of vasovagal response to the needle itself, however if you are going into the shot anxious about being nauseous you most likely will get nauseous from the anxiety alone.

"Are there anti-nausea pills or anti-seasickness pills you could take beforehand? Are you familiar with deep breathing exercises to calm the panic response? I'd also suggest working with a therapist familiar with PTSD. Bring someone with you, if you can, to literally hold your hand.

Like with most phobias, and I have some, the biggest thing you'll likely feel after the shot is relief -- that the thing you were afraid of didn't happen.

Vasovagal reactions are rare and harmless, and the clinic staff are aware that they can happen and know how to help you if you do happen to faint or feel nauseous. It's much less frightening, when you think about it, than being in an ICU or on a ventilator -- that's what I told myself when I was apprehensive.

Some things that help me when I'm afraid are to do slow breathing, where you breathe out for more counts then in. For example, breathe in for five counts, breathe out for 8. This lowers the panic response. Be sure to be well hydrated before you go, and bring a bottle of water with you. Put the cool bottle against the skin of your face or neck if you get scared, as a change of temperature will break the panic cycle. Subtly push your feet into the floor, which no one can tell you are doing. This sense of being grounded stops PTSD-related panic attacks. Say a mantra or a prayer to yourself, and visualize a clear orb of light protecting you. 

It'll be okay. It's understandable to be scared, and just remember how this is an important step for your health and the safety of others. Thank you for being brave.",nn5snc,2021-05-28 21:10:45
"Maybe try to take some deep calming breaths. If you had covid before, studies are showing you should have complete protection with just one dose, so you have some time to see if more data comes out/recommendations to decide if you want a second. In the meantime you should have good protection. If you had covid before you may have the more flu-like symptoms from the first shot.

"Also remember that the amount of nausea that actually turns into vomiting is pretty rare. Most of us have been nauseous about a bazillion times more than actual throwing up, and for those for whom it produces the latter, they are more used to it because it happens to them more readily.

Same with feeling dizzy from a vasovagal response, which I get from PTSD-triggered panic attacks and occasional low blood sugar. You feel dizzy a bazillion times more than you actually faint. I've had at least 100 vasovagal responses in the past 10 years and actual fainting was only once, and that was still just a maybe because it lasted a split-second and I was in a chair.",nn5snc,2021-05-28 21:17:46

I've heard of similar stories from people whose mind-body-spirit connection is usually extremely strong, who felt this connection was severely disrupted after getting the shot. They managed to get a clear idea of what was happening by going to see energy healers such as reiki masters. Those healers can also provide energetic healing to minimize the negative side effects the vaccine can have on the body.",nmkisv,2021-05-28 07:19:27

There are many reports of COVID and post-COVID brain fog. Not all will feel these effects, just like not all those vaccinated will feel any effect on their 'headspace'.

Giving the vaccine to young people and children is controversial because they are at very low risk of severe covid and it's more to protect others than themselves. A good friend of mine - for example - got covid from his 15yo old son. The boy had some vomits and a headache for a day, my friend got it far worse, with persisting fever, fatigue and respiratory problems for two weeks, but fortunately no lasting damage.

My mindset shifted when I thought realistically; if I get covid, even though I may not die as a 19 year old, I could have long term effects from that and there is a chance I could have serious side effects. I eventually got it done and that was 9 days ago. No side effects besides arm pain and my period coming a second time (not sure if it‚Äôs related to vaccine as my periods are irregular).

"If you're worried about getting cloths and becoming impotent, then you don't have to worry about. The clothing reaction is less likely to happen due to the vaccine than due to natural infection.

Also, the cloths appear within a couple of weeks and they dissolve if properly treated, so no worries of remaining impotent for the rest of your life.

If you're worried about side effects, consult with your doctor but, they'll answer about what you should and shouldn't worry.

">If you haven't already had Covid, is the risk to you from the vaccine greater than the risk to you from Covid? 

We lack the statistics per age group in terms of how Covid causes myocarditis in younger population. In older populations I'm sure the risk is higher from Covid than the vaccine.

In younger populations, I've seen no research that suggests that the risk from Covid is higher than from vaccine. That said, just because I haven't seen the research doesn't make it the case.

So far in USA, there's been less than 300 deaths from Covid in the 0-17 age group. Still think it's pretty wild that they want all kids over 13 vaccinated without knowing the actual rates of myocarditis in teens from vaccines.",nm6p6l,2021-05-27 22:59:52

"A lot of the guidelines/narratives clearly go beyond just ""following the science.""  I'm not going to speculate as to why that is, but that's just a fact.

Two easy example:
Look at the CDC's flip flop on masking after vaccination, a change in policy which came despite no new evidence since people had started getting vaccinated. Fauci said himself after the policy change that his prior masking after being vaccinated was for appearances only despite denying that at the time he was originally asked. 

Also, look at their guidelines with respect to vaccinating previously infected people. Go read the Pfizer and Moderna trials yourself. They say unequivocally and in plain english that there was no efficacy for that group(previously infected people). You can also pull up recorded CDC calls where deputy director Anne Shuchat reiterates this very clearly. And yet despite that clear evidence from the trials, their guidance from the very start was ""everyone should get vaccinated including those previously infected.""  That guidance was in direct opposition to the science, and yet that was the official word.",nm6p6l,2021-05-28 02:24:27

"Okay, generally curious. Why did you think a 3hr mountain bike ride was a good idea as you were suggested to ‚Äúmove around to help inflammation‚Äù? Usually that means walk around the house or go for a walk. 

I don‚Äôt think the CDC or doctors gave out good protocols of what to do following the vaccine because they don‚Äôt know what side effects could happen after you do X,Y,Z. 

To me, if you‚Äôre getting vaccinated you should probably follow same procedures you would while you‚Äôre sick. Which is hydrate, get vitamins and minerals, walk around. Don‚Äôt drink, don‚Äôt get stressed, don‚Äôt so strenuous exercise etc.

Note: I‚Äôm not trying to come off as an ass here, but I‚Äôm just trying to understand the logistics of this. I‚Äôve seen many people say after their vaccine they‚Äôll go out for drinks or go workout or something and I don‚Äôt understand it. 

Personally from reports I‚Äôve seen earlier of things like blood clots or myocarditis, I figured the best thing to do after getting the vaccine was to lay low a couple of days and treat it as if you‚Äôre sick to not have your body more stressed out then what it is already is and potentially increasing the chances of something like that happening",nm6p6l,2021-05-27 16:21:43

"I'm not one who decides if this stuff is correlated or not. Do I think so? Yeah, definitely some of the side effects are correlated. I think some are coincidences too. 

In this case, I think it's correlated. I haven't had COVID, but the vaccine side effects felt like a hangover for me. I know others who got COVID and didn't have any issues with it and others who are still having issues till this day and they're in good shape. I know some people who got COVID and had the same condition OP is talking about. 

In the end, if you're getting the vaccine solely for yourself, then it's a matter of risk assessment of the vaccine vs COVID (IMO I think the vaccine has a lower risk but that's up to decide).",nm6p6l,2021-05-27 18:26:09

It's known that the immune response will start 1-4 days after the shot... after this it takes up to 16 days for the immune system to creat antibodies and destroy the presented s- proteins

If you do a quick math 16+16 = 32/7 it's around 4 weeks. You can read about how alcohol effect your imune response if you Drink days before you may get an infection.

"(TLDR AT END) I worked in a store for 9 months and talked to all kinds of people who got vaccinated. I'd say I talked to over 50 people personally, and heard from their family members as well**. Out of those 50+ people PLUS their families and friends (which results in well over 200 people) I know of ONE person who had a bad time.** Meaning, he had a pretty high fever and got ill for a couple days. That was the worst. Most people had some pain in their arms, felt a little tired and sleepy, but they were completely after a day or two. (On the contrary, I personally know 5 people who died of Covid, and another two that almost died - one of them is back in the hospital for vomiting blood right after being discharged. He had no previous condition or symptoms before getting ill with Covid.)

Out of my family I was the only one who had it worse because the muscle pain for me lasted for 5 days and I had some (light) issues with my period, but I didn't feel sick or anything. I was a little tired the day I got it, my muscles were hurting, but other than those I felt completely fine. I'd say this is a cheap price to pay for a higher survival chance. If 5 days of pain is all I have to endure in order to have more chances of not needing a tube showed down my throat, then give me those 5 days of pain.

About the horror stories... You could find horror stories about people who took a painkiller and had a terrible time. People who ate pineapples and got incredibly sick. Of course there will be stories of vaccines too. But the difference between pineapples and vaccines is that there are no anti-pineapple activists (that I know of), but there are antivaxxers. It was proven time and time again that antivaxxers will not only spread horror stories, but make them up. I'm not saying there aren't people who had bad reactions to the vaccine, but it isn't as common as those people make it out to be.  But the virus, it really is killing people. I know because I've seen both personally. 

Besides think about this - you can have an allergic reaction to anything. You can go into an anaphylactic shock from eating pineapples and also from getting a vaccine. But the difference is that when you eat the pineapple you're probably at home, far from help, maybe by yourself. But when you get the shot you're surrounded by medical personnel and equipment, and they're ready to tackle an anaphylactic shock because they expect that a person might have it. (That's why you have to stay 30 minutes in observation after getting she shot.) You have nothing to worry about.

&#x200B;

That was long but I hope it helps. **TLDR**: Yes it's mostly safe, and even if you have a bad reaction to it you're surrounded by people who can and will help you immediately. You've got nothing to worry about.",nmmfrr,2021-05-28 09:14:19

"Well you have to keep a couple of things in mind.

One, people won't post good experiences on Reddit because it's a waste of time. What's the point of coming on just to say, ""All went well. Bye!"". So you're more inclined to see negative experiences.

Secondly, a lot of people on Reddit have been caught lying about symptoms of the vaccine,.so check their user history and if it's a recently made account with nothing but negative covid-19 vaccine posts, likely they're lying. Or even an old account that has been basically inactive for some time and all of a sudden constant activity on vaccines that speak negatively.

Also some people may be experiencing negative health effects in their normal life and as soon as they get the vaccine, they over analyze their symptoms and add something they've experienced I'm their normal lives as a vaccine symptom. Remember the average person isn't a doctor.

In essence, the vaccine is safe and effective for the most part. Any negative side effects are very rare and mostly mild. Almost nobody has died directly from the vaccines, you're more likely to die from Viagra.",nmmfrr,2021-05-28 05:20:46
"BEFORE YOU DOWNVOTE‚Äîunderstand I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. Not antivaxx. 

The benefit is mitigating the risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. If you have low risk factors (co-morbidities), are young (under 50), not overweight, eat healthy and exercise with no complicating health history; COVID-19 doesn‚Äôt pose a major health risk to you (death). If you get unlucky and contract the illness, there are effective treatment options. If you neglect to pursue them you run the risk of contacting protracted symptoms, i.e. long-covid.

The risk is adverse vaccine side-effects, which seems to be higher in the young and healthy. The risk of death is very low. But many people have experienced long-covid like symptoms from the vaccine. Likely a systemic inflammatory reaction caused by our immune response to the vaccine. This condition seems to respond well to treatments as if it were long-covid.

The risks have been blown completely out of proportion by Internet echo chambers wanting to divide and frighten us. Most vaccines, medical treatments, and even vitamins and herbs that we take without thinking twice pose more risk than these vaccines. 

I am curious about people's side effect experience but that curiosity does not mean that I would hesitate to take the vaccine again.

"There were times when people resisted the idea that not washing hands after handling a corpse and then assisting in childbirth has any effect on the deahts of women. There were times when toxic substances were put in walls, dresses and kids' toys, because they knew no better. That's the nature of science. As we evolve and know more, we realise the dangers of things we thought were safe. Look around in your house - maybe 10, 20, 100 years from now on someone will look at your furniture and point out all the things that you thought were safe, but actually cause cancer or something.

There are killers who were teachers. Clowns. Police officers. Dentists. I could go on. Does that mean we can not trust any profession anymore, shouldn't see doctors if we're sick, should let bad teeth rot in our mouth (and perhaps kill us), not call police in case of a threat, because what if those professionals are murderers? Do we just ignore everything teachers teach us because some teachers killed kids? Killers are everywhere in every profession, but that doesn't say anything about the profession itself in most of the cases. Heck, what is your gender? I can tell you at least 10 people of your gender that were killers. Does that mean that you're a killer and untrutworthy? What is your profession?

"Well, you completely avoided my first question.

Second, the CDC is full of shit about the vaccine not causing any cases of myocarditis. Bold statement, but I have the numbers to prove it. Out of the millions of doses admistered in Israel, there were 62 cases of myocarditis so far. 6 cases happened after the first dose.

56 were clustered after the 2nd dose. That's 90% of the myocarditis cases happening after the 2nd jab. And Israel is actually planning on doing something about it!

To prevent more cases of serious side effects like myocarditis in teens, they are most likely just going to give 1 shot of mRNA to the teens.

"Ok, so 3 bad reactions in total. I can absolutely accept the first two.

As for the 3rd - Can you elaborate on that? That's way to vague. How old is your ex-step-father? What kind of vaccine did he recieve, and what does ""failing health"" mean? Was it the first shot or the second he got? When did his health issues arise, how much time has passed since being administered the shot? Has he or anyone close to him tested positive for covid prior to this, is there a suspicion that he was infected? See - I can absolutely see a seisure, a high fever and allergic reactions happening, but not a ""failing health"". The way the vaccine works doesn't lead me to believe that it can cause one's health to suddenly fail, unless there's a previous undiagnosed condition at play. (Feel free to correct me if you have information suggesting the opposite.) It's suspicious if it happened close to getting the vaccine, but know that health complications can happen at any age without warning. I too have a failing health and nobody knows why, despite being 22. To me it sounds like you included this more so because of your personal distrust in doctors and/or bias regarding the vaccine itself. But again, if you have any studies or data that would suggest the opposite, please let me know. 

4th isn't a bad reaction because she didn't get it. Getting advised against it because of the unknowns doesn't mean she'd get a bad reaction. Cancer patients and survivors are a bit of a special case - their immune systems are weakened, we do not know whether getting the vaccine would actually help them. We do not know how they will react to it. And depending on the person (and the type of cancer they had), the risks of getting the vaccine might outweight the benefits. That's why you have to consult with your doctor before getting the vaccine. (Similarly, there are other conditions that exclude you from getting the vaccine. But this is nothing new, this even applies to medicine.) People like your sister are at an even higher risk of dying from COVID because of their current treatment and/or weakened immune system and/or the damages cancer caused. That's why people who do not and did not have cancer should get the vaccine, even if that only lowers the risk of infection by a little bit. It's to protect people like your sister, who are advised not to get it. You don't get the vaccine for yourself only. You get it to better your chances of survival, sure, but you also get it to better the chance of survival for the people like your sister.

I live in a small rural town. 2000 people in total. People in rural towns know each other and love to talk. Working in a local store means becoming a reporter and news anchor. I hear things before they appear in the local news (if they even do) and I distribute the news. I see and talk to the same 40-ish families every day. That's why I have a good idea of the reactions to vaccine. This is a large pool of people, and given how scared everyone is of the vaccine, if someone has a bad reaction, I'll hear about it. That's why I have a hard time believing what you say - unless you (and your relatives) just got incredibly unlucky.",nmmfrr,2021-05-30 12:58:07

The CDC is investigating it, and beyond speculation, we can't prove or disprove the cause.

As someone that is still fighting covid-like side effects from the Moderna vaccine after four weeks today, it is offensive to advocate for individuals to sacrifice their own health out of some misguided ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù argument. It is also unethical not to provide someone asking this question perspective on the real risk of (hidden) side effects. In the medical world, this is formerly called ‚Äúinformed consent ‚Äú.

I‚Äôve seen six doctors over my side effects. Previously I was in perfect health. All the doctors report they are seeing a lot patients young healthy with these side effects.

Please be honest with the general public and tell them what the actual risks are. Also, the individuals who get messed up the vaccine in small, moderate, or big ways, are pretty much stuck with the medical bills themselves and this is a great injustice.

"Lot of assumptions there about who I was talking about. Why does it even matter?

If my wife trusted her GP and first 2 specialist when it came to her struggle with c-diff few years ago, she very well could be dead or permanently fucked up from being on vancomycin for years. They initially didn't even believe that she had c-diff because of how young she was, and then just kept giving her rounds of vancomycin for 6 months and c-diff kept coming back. We seeked an FMT for her through a 3rd specialist who was actually competent and who couldn't believe that the previous doctors wanted to keep her on vanco for that long.

I know that's anecdotal, but if my wife and I didn't trust our intuition about anti-biotics not being a sustainable long term solution and had distrust on how qualified her GP and specialists were in the matter, the story may have ended in tragic circumstances.

Doctors don't know how an individual actually feels and are not some Omnipotent force out there. They are an absolutely critical instrument when it comes getting quality healthcare, but to trust a doctor over your own self is not something that everyone needs to do.

If it works for you, great! But don't insist that's the best way, because as I mentioned, there's a good chance my wife wouldn't even be here in the way that she is if we trusted doctors over our own understanding of the situation.

Oh bonus round, the doctor and nurse at the hospital where our daughter was born initially tried to convince us to give formula to our daughter instead of being provided donor breastmilk when my wife had trouble producing. I had to raise hell to get my daughter milk instead of formula.

So, explain me, why did 90% of the myocarditis cases cluster after the 2nd dose if it's just typical background levels?

"Okay the problem with that would be, let's not blame the victim. If abstaining from alcohol was a thing, that should be stated before vaccination as part of informed consent, but it is not.

In fact I have seen government entities partner with saloons and taverns to drum up business and promote vaccination by advertising a free drink to vaccinated individuals over the age of 21.

No one would be so stupid as to getting purposely over-vaccinated for a free drink, but I really wonder about the larger and cash incentives. How sure are we that they are not getting repeat customers?",nm5u3b,2021-05-28 00:30:41

"> I don't think there's that high of a chance getting Covid will give you long term issues, more than a vaccine could.

That would be incorrect.  Covid causes damage to your body by first infecting your lungs then infecting other parts of your body leaving permanent damage if the infection is severe enough.  Those infected cells will die and healthy cells will die as well due to Covid attacking the body's mechanism to defend against viruses. There are just also some parts of the body that can't be repaired back to 100% so if the infection is severe enough, good bye lung capacity and other issues.  

The contents of the vaccines don't do any of this.  Your body detects the protein as an intruder when injected into your shoulder, creates antibodies and those antibodies provide protection against the virus should it reappear.  Lungs are not infected, the virus itself does not appear.

Statically, Covid will unquestionable cause more harm at a extremely higher chance vs the mRNA vaccine.  

As of Feb. 21, there had been 63 million doses of mRNA vaccines administered in the US. There were 1,099 reports of death logged to VAERS in this time ‚Äì a rate of 0.0015%. The CDC said a review of available information in these cases showed no evidence the vaccine contributed to these deaths.  [Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-mrna-vaccines-idUSKCN2AU2KR)

As of today, 33.2 million covid cases in the US, 593K deaths.  Even if all 1,099 reports of death from above were 100% due to the vaccines, which they are not, I will take my second dose based on those odds alone.

Anything you read that says spike proteins do this or vaccines do that isn't a valid source.  Talk to your doctor or a pharmacy to get real information about the vaccines and stop going to the internet and social media to find information that will confuse and scare you.",nm5u3b,2021-05-28 16:01:44

"By only getting one shot you still run a high risk of contracting a variant of covid. You need both doses for maximum efficacy.

I've searched about this and the whole internet seems to say that's it's okay to consume alcohol. But I wonder if they're just saying this so that people would get the vaccine. I imagine saying that you shouldn't drink like a month before and after, and people might not want to even get the vaccine, let alone the second jab. Or am I stretching too far? It's just that my thoughts are, alcohol causes inflammation anyway, so how can that be good for you after getting the vaccine?

At least I was told not to drink the day after, nor exercise, so I'm glad at least my country has got that somewhat correct. Still dreading the second shot as well..",nm5u3b,2021-05-29 16:21:55

I‚Äôll see if I can find the actual study that I read and link it.

Now I‚Äôm on several medications that I did not previously need, and I‚Äôve gained about 30 lbs from both the meds + inability to workout + depression.

I hate the gaslighting by docs and society, telling us the vaccine can't cause this. Yes it CAN. I got POTS from one of the safest, most benign beta blocker meds out there. ANYTHING can give you POTS, so the gaslighting isn't fucking appreciated. Also ditto on the itching, the rash only shows up if I scratch at it but it's weird how there's no swelling, redness, or anything. Just itching. I assume this is an autoimmune reaction.

I had a fairly extreme immune reaction to the shot, many side effects. So thought its just the immune reaction. After about a week it quit hurting, but I could still feel it enlarged a couple more weeks. By my 2nd shot 1 month later I could hardly feel it. It did not swell again with 2nd shot.

TL;DR: Your immune system and you brain are closely linked from birth. Your immune system causes inflammation to ward off threats, locally (specific body parts) and systemically (body-wide). So it stands to reason that immune response - which a vaccine can cause just as much as an illness - can also affect your brain, because it links so closely with the body-wide immune system",nm9k00,2021-05-28 12:46:09

"She tracks all her calories in an app so I just checked what she ate and its all clean stuff. All home cooked stuff that we've had before. 

The meat meals were the same for both of us (and at the same time), so if it was food poisoning I would have felt something. I had nothing at all. The snacks and junk she ate are all pretty standard things that don't generally have issues (basically cereal and bread) and even then those were only ~300 calories.

I'm thinking its more like what u/Tart_Cherry_Bomb says 

>It is possible that the vaccine caused nausea, which caused vomiting. Then the loss of electrolytes from vomiting and not replenishing them adequately caused dehydration and low blood sodium levels, which caused her blood pressure to drop and induced dizziness, confusion, and, eventually, fainting and a seizure.

On this point, her sodium intake up to the end of Monday were consistently in the ~1800 to 2300 mg range so a bit above the recommended limit. She does drink more water than most people so that probably brings her back to the a reasonable level.

Its just that the last two days, nothing was sticking, the only thing that stuck were some of [these cookies](https://www.darefoods.com/ca_en/product/vinta-original/125) which she ate a lot of. This has a fair amount of sodium.  She had like 15 of these.

Basically seems like whatever caused the vomiting shuts the system down completely.and flushes out the sodium rapidly. She went from 100% sodium to 'dangerously low' levels in 48 hours. 

I agree that we should have known that sodium levels needed to replenished but this is completely new to me. Usually, if I need to throw up, I feel shitty for a bit, throw up, take a nap and perfectly fine a few hours later. There was no calm here at any point.",nm44ke,2021-05-27 16:09:48
"I agree. The vomiting every thirty minutes is a pretty classic stomach virus or food poisoning symptom. In the case of a stomach virus, headaches, chills, and a fever are also really common symptoms. 

I had what I believe were delayed onset side effects from the Pfizer vaccine. One was back pain, the other was a sporadic racing heartbeat. I believe they were genuine side effects; however, it is just as, if not more, likely that the ‚Äúside effects‚Äù I experienced were from a virus unrelated to COVID. We all have a tendency to chalk up anything out of the ordinary we experience to the vaccine, since the vaccine is out of the ordinary, and even its proponents - like me - are a bit uneasy or nervous about getting it. Correlation is not causation, though, and it‚Äôs important to keep reminding ourselves of that. 

I think a seizure or fainting soon after the vaccine - like within 24 hours - is a lot more likely to be a vaccine side effect, though a rare one, as I believe those effects have been attributed to vaccines. 

It is possible that the vaccine caused nausea, which caused vomiting. Then the loss of electrolytes from vomiting and not replenishing them adequately caused dehydration and low blood sodium levels, which caused her blood pressure to drop and induced dizziness, confusion, and, eventually, fainting and a seizure. 

To say that the vaccine caused a seizure in this case seems to be quite a stretch, however. I‚Äôm not casting any blame, as OP couldn‚Äôt be expected to know the dangers of such prolonged vomiting without electrolyte supplementation, but it is likely that the low blood sodium could have been solved by getting some salt into mom earlier. Saltine crackers are often used when people have been vomiting both because they are quickly digested but also because they have a high sodium content. Ditto for broths. Years ago when my daughter was sick with a nasty upper respiratory virus that interfered with her eating and drinking, the pediatrician stressed repeatedly that my daughter needed sodium, and told me to keep pushing salty foods and water above all. 

As soon as my mom, who has blood pressure issues, gets a little weak acting and light headed, I‚Äôm pumping her full of pretzels. Takes less than ten minutes for her to feel better. Sodium is CRUCIAL.",nm44ke,2021-05-27 15:14:06
"> food poisoning
Trigerring a seizure? Really?",nm44ke,2021-05-27 15:05:09
It is well known that dehydration can cause low sodium and a rapid decrease in sodium can cause seizures so the doctors are right it IS the cause of OP's mom's seizure.  However the reason for the dehydration/vomiting was the vaccine which then led to a seizure.  Your friend's seizure may well have been directly caused by the vaccine but that is not the case for OP's mom.,nm44ke,2021-05-27 15:03:01

Somehow they did a good work with the anchoring mechanism after the translation of the mrna into the S-Protein. (as far as we know, there are no effects with the MRNA Vaccination which causes the same symptoms... in fact there are reports on VEARS that show the opposite)  So its was just i coin flip. 50/50   


  


Im not an anti-vaxxer but they should stop J&J and Astra now! because if this is true, the vaccination is a ticking bomb in your body releasing spikes directly into your blood stream which causes thrombosis.   


Here is the paper: [https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1)  


Have fun reading it. im sure it will make an impact because there are a lot of people discussing this since October 2020.",nm7c79,2021-05-27 18:02:10
so far i don't see any explanation for the extremely high percentage of premenopausal women getting the clots.,nm7c79,2021-05-28 02:02:42
This explanation of antibodies against the alternatively spliced spike is not very convincing to me. The key feature of people having blood clots is a decrease in the count of platelets or thrombocytopenia which is not explained by spike protein theory. The manifestation of these blood clots is very similar to the case of Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and so the second theory seems to be more plausible. Negatively charged free DNA from the vector vaccine can interact with the positively charged protein platelet factor 4(PF4) forming a complex. This complex can generate autoantibodies that can cause platelet activation leading to blood clots and a decrease in the platelet count.,nm7c79,2021-05-28 07:32:08
">I got the j and j over a month ago, so I‚Äôm out of the blood clot window. But the parts that I am concerned about are:
>
>1 - it says that the DNA sequence for the spike protein is sent to the nucleus with viral vector vaccines. Is it safe to have this happening inside our nucleus? Isn‚Äôt that where our DNA is?

It's completely safe. The DNA sequence delivered by the modified virus is translated to RNA inside the nucleus, then the RNA exits the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it is processed in exactly the same way as one of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.

>2 - Is it harmful to have these splices inside our our nucleus to close to our DNA?

No. 

I *think* what the article is saying is that some of the DNA delivered by the virus somehow falls apart or is damaged, so it is translated into an RNA string that is not exactly what it is supposed to be. Then the RNA is used to create a spike protein that is not quite how it is supposed to be. 

Proteins are not created inside the nucleus, only in the cytoplasm: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15145360/

>3 - Is there any long term harmful affects of having this splicing happen?

No.

"This is the interesting part:   


""Based on our findings, we strongly suggest that the Spike open reading frames ‚Äì wildtype or codon-optimized - in vector-based vaccines has to be re-optimized to avoid unintended splice reactions and to increase the safety of these pharmaceutical products. Vice versa, all mRNA-based vaccines should represent safe products, because the delivered mRNA will only be translated into surface antigen, without having any possibility to participate in nuclear splice events.""",nm7c79,2021-05-27 18:09:56
"""Im not an anti-vaxxer but they should stop J&J and Astra now! because if this is true, the vaccination is a ticking bomb in your body releasing spikes directly into your blood stream which causes thrombosis.""

Just read the paper. There isn't a reference to how the vaccine is a ""ticking time bomb"" the paper explains how thrombotic events are occurring as that was not explained previously. 

""Based on our splicing data, membrane-anchored and soluble Spike protein variants are produced after the vaccination procedure. When the immune system now starts the production of anti-Spike antibodies (days 4‚Äì16), these antibodies will recognize the membrane-anchored as well as soluble Spike proteins. However, the soluble fraction of Spike protein variants is disseminated throughout the body and concentrates at various sites of those endothelial cells expressing the ACE2 surface protein. These ACE-bound Spike protein variants will become targets of the newly produced antibodies and will cause an ADCC/CDC-mediated inflammatory reaction involving several immune cells. It may also cause the already described NET reaction of neutrophils which has already been shown to induce thromboembolic events (19‚Äì21).""",nm7c79,2021-05-27 18:40:27

"Thank you for your helpful reply! I think the part of the article that had me concerned was it said:

‚ÄúOnce inside the cell nucleus, certain parts of the spike protein splice, or split apart, creating mutant versions, which are unable to bind to the cell membrane where important immunisation takes place. The floating mutant proteins are instead secreted by cells into the body, triggering blood clots in roughly one in 100,000 people, according to Prof Marschalek‚Äôs theory.‚Äù

They *maybe, could be* harmful regarding the risk of a clot or them binding to something important that you don't want an antibody to bind to.

But they don't affect your DNA.

>Do the cells affected by the vaccine die off anyways?

Yes, they get attacked by your immune system.  So even if the DNA of that one cell was modified, it will die shortly.",nm7c79,2021-05-27 21:42:40
"I've done some reading about the adenovirus vector and the spike proteins in general. The assumption on the ""mutant versions"" of the spike protein is that it would be cleared by your body just like the regular spike protein would be. It wouldn't hang around in your system.

"From https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting:

This safety update report is based on detailed analysis of data up to 19 May 2021. At this date, an estimated 12.7 million first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 24.2 million first doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca had been administered, and around 10.5 million and 10.7 million second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca respectively. An approximate 0.3 million first doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna have also now been administered.

So, assuming that all fatalities are actually linked to the vaccine (and that is a big assumption), your rate is (to the nearest whole number):

AZ: 1 in 43,300
Pfizer: 1 in 60,732
Moderna: 1 in 75,000 (not many jabs given of this one so far, so it looks pretty good by that metric)

It's actually 382 for Pfizer https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/989996/COVID-19_mRNA_Pfizer-_BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print.pdf and 806 for AZ https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/989997/COVID-19_vaccine_AstraZeneca_analysis_print.pdf as of the latest reports and numbers, but it's easy to do the math.

Edit - It is hard to get any real proportions based on no demarcations between reactions for first and second doses. So this is a very flat analysis that doesn't take into account reactions appear to be more likely to the first AZ shot and to the second mRNA shots. A report may be filed more than once in the same person (not something causing death, obviously), for more than one symptom, or at least I can't discount the possibility. And ignore my initial figures, as I obviously can't do arithmetic this close to bed.",nm7c79,2021-05-27 23:21:29

Yes it did,nm7qa3,2021-05-29 13:57:15
My doctor told me to delay the 2nd shot to give my body time to heal which makes sense cuz originally I was suppose to get my 2nd shot next weekend but I'm still dealing this pretty heavily. That would just be overkill on an already weakened body. I feel less stress over that as an option and my doctor has worked with me for years so he knows my body and that he's choosing what's best for my particular health.,nm7qa3,2021-05-28 00:13:35

Wow smh covid as well as the covid vaccine can cause high resting heart rate.

Yeah I looked up exercises I can do and I read about turmeric helping a lot of ppl so I bought some so I can make tea and hopefully I can create a good routine. My doctor told me to let him know when I schedule my appointment so he can refill my meds to use after if it starts up again so I feel optimistic about the plan now so I'm not suffering like I did with the first.,nm7qa3,2021-05-28 01:10:45

"In case anyone stumbles upon this post in the future, I figured out how to get an answer! 


Through obsessive googling, I found a blog post from my healthcare system which discusses testing for people in my situation (immunocompromised and curious if the vaccine ""worked""). I wrote to the authors asking them how to interpret the test - not asking for myself (which I assume should generate a ""I'm not your doctor, go ask her"" response), but just asking in general what's known about how the results correlate with actual protection, particularly in immunocompromised people. One of them - the head of the immunology lab for the entire hospital system - wrote back to me *immediately* with a very thorough, clear reply, as if I were a colleague! (My husband thinks the ""PhD"" in my email signature helped, even though it's in a completely unrelated field.)

She basically said that the IgG numbers in the test I was given correlate to a parallel assay of actual neutralizing antibodies in a study they did of 30 people. Anything above 0.7 was associated with a 100% chance of having the antibodies. Furthermore, my score of 1.9 is at the very top of their range, past which ""the linearity of the assay disappears and we cannot quantify the level of antibody without doing titration.""

Regarding negative IgA, she said most people are negative on this after vaccination, and they don't entirely know what it means. Some people test positive and appear to be ""extra protected"" (probably less likely to catch or transmit covid, even asymptomatically), but testing negative does not mean I'm *not* protected.

tl;dr: Although they didn't test my exact antibody level, there's a very good chance that I have enough antibodies to be protected from severe disease - at least, I'm just as protected as the next person who received the vaccine. Words do not express the amount of relief I feel right now. ü•≤",nmkxbk,2021-05-29 01:21:22

"No idea why he would do that unless he doesn't understand immunology or virology in depth.  Especially when the test that he got wasn't even against specifically RBD but rather whole spike.  

His entire argument starting at 3:14 is just bunk.  We already know that SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity from natural infection is a lot less than from the vaccine.  That's been shown in numerous studies of the vaccines.  Other vaccines with greater protective immunity in vaccination than natural disease are HepB, tetanus, diphtheria, HPV, Hib...   Looking like pneumococcal may fall into this category in a few years once it's better studied as well.  

3:35 The current recommendation from the CDC isn't 90 days.  It's 90 days if you've had COVID **and** have been treated with monoclonal antibody therapy/convalescent plasma.  This is to make sure monoclonal antibodies or antibodies from convalescent plasma are cleared from the system because they will attack the spike protein directly rather than allowing the body's immune system to respond to the spike protein to generate its own antibodies.  You'd figure a physician would know how long antibody therapies last in the body.  The recommendation for those that have had COVID without antibody therapy is as soon as the person has recovered, get them vaccinated. 

4:08 Asymptomatic spread.  Bull...shit.  There's plenty of evidence that vaccines prevent asymptomatic spread of illnesses.  From measles to influenza to SARS-CoV-2.  There's evidence of prevention of asymptomatic spread through the generation of IgA antibodies that line the mucosa.  If it didn't, we'd have thousands of cases of diseases like measles in the US yearly in children under 1 year of age (vaccine is given at 12 months) from their older siblings.  Guy needs to understand minimum infectious dose.   

4:35  Hyperimmune response.  No evidence of it for SARS-CoV-2.  It's Th1 driven.  Not Th2 driven like SARS-CoV.  And if there were evidence of it, we'd see hyperimmune responses in people that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well.  He really didn't think that one through.

"This honestly makes sense.

All of the following applies to the under 25 crowd:

>They are the lowest risk demographic for poor COVID case outcome

>They are the highest risk demographic for adverse reactions post vaccine

>Their immune systems are largely more capable than their older counterparts 

Honestly, it seems the science may end up showing that the risk to benefit ratio for a second dose just isn‚Äôt there for the under 25 crowd. The evidence also suggests that myocarditis, one of the adverse effects is 9x more likely to occur after dose 2.

The only reason the regimen is two doses is because that‚Äôs how they were tested. Moderna was the only group that tried to see how effective a single shot was, and they estimated it to be around 80%. The science says that two shots provide a more durable level of protection, but the science has also originally said that masks aren‚Äôt needed. It doesn‚Äôt make the science wrong, science by nature of what it is is continuously growing in knowledge.

Let me be clear, I am pro vaccination but this is a conversation people need to be having with their doctors. And they need to heed the doctor‚Äôs advice. Let me also be clear that ***the majority of people who get vaccinated will not suffer major adverse effects***. But we shouldn‚Äôt be passing judgement on those who are a bit apprehensive at this moment because as with everything else in life, there‚Äôs a risk involved.

>‚ÄúSo in **a situation in which the cases are low** in Israel, the level of protection with one dose is desirable, and we limit the possibility of side effects, at least, until we know more about these pathologies.‚Äù

Saying that it's public health policy to approve vaccines that we don't know the rate of side effects in specific democratics for public use in any other time than pandemic wouldn't be correct.

Right now the public health officials are kind of winging the policies. Official policies relating to protecting demographics that are increasingly vulnerable for adverse side effects from vaccines, and decreasingly vulnerable from adverse effects of Covid should be viewed as individuals, not as just potential collaterative casualties that needs to be taken to protect the greater population as a whole.

Israel is willing to meet in the middle, protect the youth from more serious adverse effects and also protect the herd immunity with the 1 vaccine proposal.

Believe or not, it's not the civic duty of any 12 or 16 year old to get vaccinated for the greater good of everyone else. It's a choice they can make, or their parents can make because it the best thing for them.

"Well, the article suggests that Israel considers the risks that come with both doses of mRNA vaccines too large for teenagers based on whatever kind of resources their public health officials have available to them. That does not answer your question though, but does demonstrate that our closest ally does see very real risks in the adverse effects to their youth population while they may be smaller than the risk that Covid poses to them.

If it wasn't for Covid taking place currently, vaccines with this severe side effects would never be recommend for children without multiple years of further study. I understand that our current circumstances are non-ordinary and non-ordinary measures must be taken place. However, the main consensus in terms of why children should be vaccinated is to protect the ones around them first, and the secondary benefit.is the immunity they gain themselves. 

The study you requested does not exist. It doesn't make making millions of children ""volunteers"" in what's still essentially the clinicial trial phase of the vaccine when it comes to the impact it has on 12-15 year olds, morally acceptable without doing a through risk assessment on the vaccines safety.

As I've said before and you never responded to this, how come do we have science suggesting that JJ and AZ vaccines cause blood clots in 1 in 10,000 individuals and studies suggesting blood clots 1 in 1,200,000 individuals if science when it comes to the impacts that the vaccine has are well understand?

A person asks a health official, ""Is it bad there is no long term data"", in which the official responds, ""Well, the safety is great for the period we have tested it and, we just don't see long term effects that are not noticed initially in vaccines."" The issue is, mRNA vaccines is its own technology and the term vaccine is a broad over-aching term.

It is said there is no reason to believe that any issues should arise and no evidence exists but, a  counter argument to this is the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

Nonetheless, personally, I am not so much worried on the direct impact of vaccines but rather, how it will interact on a global level (in terms of impact on the pandemic). This is as,  some have hypothesized that the narrowly targeting vaccines used in the west will allow for variants to propagate to a greater degree.

Then, if immune escape from the current vaccine mediated antibodies is achieved (in which the antibodies still bind but do not neutralize the virus), then the innate immune system may be outcompeted (already is when you are vaccinated and have the antibodies, its just that the antibodies work in neutralizing the virus). 

How big of an issue is it if this occurs? Well... the main reason most young and/or healthy people are not significantly impacted by the virus is due to this innate immune system. Therefore, if this hypothesis proves true, it would prove very negative on peoples health.

This idea has been proposed by Geert Vanden Bossche and, many people have attempted to debunk his argument. Upon reading both the ""debunkings"" and Geerts counterarguments, I personally remain uncertain if Bossches fears are probable/possible.",nm5qgj,2021-05-27 16:23:20

Do not get the second shot. You have had a reaction to the first one, that is a contraindication to getting the second. Many are developing myocarditis after the second shot. I am a health care provider and the second shot is a booster, it is meant to trigger a harder response so you have more immunity to virus.

BTW, I am a Doctor of Nursing Practice. I am 9 weeks from my first shot and I still have some residual pericarditis. Even if you got the second, you should still be wearing mask and sanitizing. You can still get infected with both shots.

"The immunity after one dose is less than you think and part of the immune response is missing until after  the second dose. That is unless you have had covid previously.

I understand being nervous. My son is due his second Moderna in a few days and I admit Im nervous too. His dad had Pfizer with no issues. 

The people that had this reaction a while ago report it is getting better. IIRC- Its not been reported as a permanent issue. This article about Myocarditis also mentions if caught early it can go away. [LINKY](https://www.texasheart.org/heart-health/heart-information-center/topics/myocarditis/)

If you get Covid. They did a study and found that 73% of people hospitalized with Covid now have longterm side effects and they dont know if or when they will resolve. This was on the CBS nightly news and I didnt catch the source for the info. They are also finding that a large percentage of people that didnt enter the hospital are having issues crop up months later. There has been some talk that its a virus that stays in your body forever like herpesviruses (chickenpox etc) and will flare up. 

My daughter had covid. It went to her lungs. She said there is no way she is taking the chance of getting it again. She had both Moderna doses with mild side effects for 24 hours.",nlhbwe,2021-05-27 21:38:22

"Hopefully you are finding some good information. I can give you some anecdotal information so far as what I have experienced along with my friends and family. I got both shots of the Pfizer vaccine and the only side effect I experienced was a sore arm for a couple of days. Almost all of my close friends and family have now had it too. There was a range of experience among them. Pretty much everyone felt fine except for a sore arm after shot #1. I would say about a third of the people I know were like me and felt basically fine through both shots. Another third had mild symptoms after the 2nd shot like headache and body aches. Another third felt like absolute hell but only for about 24 hours. My mom may have had it the worst. She actually had covid and had suffered long-term effects for about a year afterwards. That 2nd shot hit her like a mack truck and she felt absolutely terrible for 24 hours. The cool thing is that after that, she not only felt better but some of those long-term symptoms like bruised feet, depression, and brain fog have all improved. Everyone I know, by two days after shot #2, felt completely fine. I know anecdotal evidence only counts for so much but we are wired to make decisions based on social reinforcement as humans. It's the kind of evidence we tend to listen to most. Still, keep researching and looking for information. Talk to your doctor. 

If you decide to get it, my best recommendation is to drink lots of water before and after while eating a lot of fruits and veggies. When the arm soreness hits, get it moving! Even a short workout can reduce that soreness a ton. I went surfing the day after my first dose and to the gym the day after the 2nd. That worked great for me. Good luck!",nlu2ci,2021-05-27 00:49:04

"It helped me to remember that what people post on social media, including here, are anecdotes and single data points. While understanding what others experience is interesting no one person's single experience is a scientific study nor can it tell us anything for sure about the vaccines.

I think the studies that have happened say a few things:

* The vaccines are effective in protecting against Covid19 and most of the variants, but none are perfectly effective
* You can expect to probably have some side effects, but anything beyond a day or two of flu like symptoms is incredibly uncommon
* There are some ultra rare side effects that are still being looked into
* The chance of the ultra rare side effects are less likely than having negative effects if you catch Covid

Sooo, it's all up to you. You might have a pre-existing condition that makes the cost-benefit better to skip the vaccine, and if that might be the case you should talk to your doctor. If you do decide to go ahead with the vaccine then be prepared for some side effect. Maybe schedule the vaccination time before you have a day off and pickup some tylenol to have on hand. 

And even if you do have a rare side effect you can still go to the doctor and they will almost certainly be able to help you out. I thought I was going to die from side effects, but it turned out when I went to the hospital I was having panic attacks and I was fine 24 hours later.

But still, there is a 1 in millions and millions chance that you could die from the vaccine. That's still way less than risking the virus, and it's even less likely than the potential risk of doing things like getting in a car and driving down the street.",nlu2ci,2021-05-27 00:34:42

This means phase III trials for the Pfizer mRNA vaccine are still on-going and won‚Äôt conclude until 2023. By definition this means the vaccine is still experimental. You won't find a single official source denying this.

>Pfizer submitted a Pharmacovigilance Plan (PVP) to monitor safety concerns that could be associated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The Sponsor identified vaccine-associated enhanced disease including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease as an important potential risk.

>Available data do not indicate a risk of vaccine-enhanced disease, and conversely suggest effectiveness against severe disease within the available follow-up period. However, risk of vaccine-enhanced disease over time, potentially associated with waning immunity, remains unknown and needs to be evaluated further in ongoing clinical trials and in observational studies that could be conducted following authorization and/or licensure. 

-Page 44, Page 52, FDA emergency authorization for the Pfizer Vaccine. - https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download

Vaccine Enhanced Disease is when a vaccine has the opposite effect, and makes a recipient at more risk if they catch the virus then they otherwise would've if they hadn't been vaccinated.

>For DP, the manufacturing process was changed from a Classical process to an Upscale process involving an increase in batch size (capable of accommodating larger RNA input) to meet commercial need. A comparison of available DP batch release data and an in-depth analytical comparability assessment between six representative Classical process DP batches and one Upscale process DP batch support the use of the Upscale process for DP manufacture under emergency use. A more comprehensive comparability assessment encompassing additional lots from multiple DP manufacturing nodes is ongoing and the results will be provided to the EUA upon completion of the study.

>Stability studies have been designed to support the use of vaccine under the EUA. All available stability data generated using the BNT162b2 DS and DP lots support the emergency deployment of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Page 47, FDA emergency authorization for the Pfizer Vaccine. - https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download

This means the vaccine batches administered to the public are different to the ones used in the clinical trials. This is due to the up-scaling requirements for mass production, which can effect the consistency and stability of the vaccine ingredients. Investigation into the effects or extent of this are still on-going.

 While you're at it, look up articles about the chances of COVID being deadly or severe. It is *much* higher than any adverse reaction from this vaccine.

I decided to get it, in spite of it being suspended due to blood clotting issue because first, it's one and done.

Speaking from experience, the only symptom I got was soreness in the arm right after the shot. I just moved my arm as recommended and it's gone. I felt a headache and I just get up and move around and I felt better.

I actually thought my period was affected but nope. I am using a menstrual cycle app and my period came as it's supposed to sorry if TMI for you.

I guess I got lucky, I didn't have any side effects at all. By the way so is my husband. He also got J&J. I think he also got headaches but he always have headaches coz of his sinus anyway.

I need to say though maybe the fact that I never ever had a flu shot helped. I never get the point of annual flu shot. Why? Honestly I believe they should study that, maybe the (needless) annual flu shot not the covid vaccine, is the reason for all those side effects!!

Plus these vaccines are not really an ""unknown"" or ""new"" They were already working on vaccines for coronaviruses for decades but, never had such concentrated funding and coordinated effort before this novel coronavirus caused so much havoc. These vaccines are saving lives and will help us live normal lives again and prevent this virus from mutating into something we do not yet have a vaccine for, as long as enough people get the vaccine to stop the spread of this virus.",nlu2ci,2021-05-27 02:30:22

There‚Äôs been people with adverse effects to the vaccine but there‚Äôs also been people with horrible effects to covid itself.

 I addressed that in my comment, if you read it. And 99% survival rate with a virus as contagious as this still means a *lot* of people will still die if infected. Lets get hyperbolic and say all 7.8 Billion humans on the planet got infected with COVID, 1% of those would be 78,000,000. By your logic, that woud be an acceptable number? Of course we will never see that scenario in reality thank god, but it still applies to a smaller scale of that calculation. 

 And the 99% figure only takes into account deaths. Like I said in my comment, there are many cases of long-term effects from the virus, including my once-healthy friend who experienced trouble breathing.",nlu2ci,2021-05-27 01:39:28

"I honestly don‚Äôt understand why people keep making this argument, unless they are that close to death or  have lived such a fulfilling life already that they don‚Äôt care to leave behind their loved ones. As a young person who desires to live the rest of my life as a mentally and physically fit being, the reason I don‚Äôt want to contract COVID is because I don‚Äôt want to risk having to live the rest of my life with quality-of-life altering symptoms that prevent me from living a normal, independent life, not just for myself but for my loved ones, too. How much can I enjoy life if I am left with permanent lung damage to where I can‚Äôt make it across the parking lot to my car without feeling like I‚Äôm going to pass out every time? Or if I am unable to taste anything other than metal in most foods that I eat, or smell sewage when there isn‚Äôt anything around? I don‚Äôt want to go to the doctor for brain fog that affects my job performance, only to be told it‚Äôs just my anxiety after having multiple lab tests run that doesn‚Äôt get me any meaningful treatment. I don‚Äôt want to lose my job over taking so many sick days that I couldn‚Äôt help but take because my mind and body just couldn‚Äôt keep up. Why risk having my quality of life and youth taken from me when I have so much to live for and so many loved ones to take care of, when all I had to do was make the simple choice to protect myself? The whole point of getting the vaccine is to increase your chances of not having your quality of life diminished for the rest of your life. 

I highly recommend following the r/covidlonghaulers sub to understand the frustration and pain they are going through. I really feel for those who tried their best to protect themselves and others but ultimately contracted COVID before vaccines were available.

And sadly, most of what we hear in these subs are the negative ‚Äúreviews‚Äù of getting the vaccine. There are so many people who don‚Äôt feel compelled to take the time to write about their positive experiences because they are most likely busy enjoying their lives having increased their risk tolerances, and they should be! Remember that the chances of serious complications from the vaccine are incredibly low when you do the math correctly, and even lower when you compare against the chances of serious complications from actually contracting COVID.",nlu2ci,2021-05-27 03:52:13

As someone who caught something at the age of 25 that shouldn‚Äôt have made me very sick that left me in the hospital with scarred lungs, I would recommend people get vaccinated. Sometimes you get very sick from something with a 99% survival rate for no reason, and you can live with the after effects for the rest of your life. Your chances of getting long-term effects from covid are much greater than your chances of getting complications from the vaccine, and fact is, nobody knows how you will fare with it until you get it.",nlu2ci,2021-05-27 02:23:11

"A vaccine by definition is a weakened or deadened virus. Only 2 manufacturers(Janssen and Astra Zeneca) have the right to call their products a vaccine. The other 2 manufacturers(Moderna and Pfizer) use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid), they theoretically work by injecting viral mRNA into the body, where it replicates inside your cells and encourages your body to recognise, and make antigens for, the ‚Äúspike proteins‚Äù of the virus. They have been the subject of research since the 1990s, but before 2020 no mRNA vaccine has ever been approved. It is a rushed and untested ""vaccine"", made using unprecedented technology, with no legal recourse should it do you harm, to treat a virus 99.8% of people will survive.

I am glad to see you questioning and weighing your options. A lot of the information I found was on Google, the manufacturers website regarding their products and some math using worldometer to determine survival rate.

"> How about they exist because they were harmed or they have seen the harm vaccines can do. 

Of course they can (and often do) cause harm in a very small number of people.  It's a **risk assessment**.  Far, far, far more people are helped than harmed by vaccines.  I mean, want to go back to [this](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e50eda9dc218c47b29aee55b8f61e889d817c54b/0_0_2550_1971/master/2550.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c80ad39d222ca3c9f0d7a376a32c95bf) because you don't want to get vaccinated for polio?

Similarly, you could get into a car wreck where you survive, but are trapped by your seatbelt and die in the fire where you could have escaped otherwise.  But *statistically*, you are far more likely to be saved by a seatbelt than harmed by one.

If your loved one was killed in a car wreck by getting trapped by their seatbelt, would you become an anti-seatbelt advocate, despite seatbelts saving **far** more people than they injure?

I would surely hope that a medication for a condition is less dangerous than the condition itself. Your statement is doing a huge disservice to the research and effort that went to this case study and is incredibly ignorant to claim that's all you need to know.

The anti-vax propaganda is real and a threat to public health. On the other side, we have pro-vaccine propaganda being spread through individuals like yourself with no scientific understanding and zero reading comprehension skills if that's the only thing you pull from the article.

Do you highly dislike science or something to make such a stretch of an inaccurate assessment of the content in this study?

>We believe that given the negative PCR test for COVID-19, as well as the negative viral serologies, myocarditis, in this instance, was due to the vaccine, rather than acute infection, but the latter possibility cannot be totally discounted.

"Oh okay. So help me understand, why did Israel observe out of the 62 myocarditis cases, 6 of them happened after the first dose, and 56 happened after the 2nd dose?

"Wow ! My 16 year old son got second Pfizer vaccine April 19. He only got mild discomfort on vaccine site with both doses. But about 3 weeks after fully vaccinated he also had a rash and I also thought it was ringworm. Took him to his pediatrician and diagnosed him with same thing - pityriasis rosea .
I had never heard of it. 
Pediatrician said it will go away on its own in a few weeks or months. No treatment needed. 
He only had occasional  mild itching on chest for a few days but not anymore . The back is like a Christmas tree pattern rash , dr says it‚Äôs the sign of that rash.

My son is doing on line classes so he doesn‚Äôt go to school or anywhere and has all his vaccines up to date too. He is asthmatic, no other issues.

But yea dr said not contagious. So idk coulda been vaccine or just coincidence he got this after vaccine .
I‚Äôm still super thankful we have all been fully vaccinated in my household.

It was one of the reasons I didn't want to get the vaccine last month but was made to get it anyway, but I learned how to deal with the heart palpitations. From what I've been reading around here, that's normal no matter which vaccine you take. 

My only personal advice is when it happens, use deep breathing to normalize it. Think of nothing, just clear your mind. Or maybe go watch some boring documentary that you don't care about as something you can use to make you feel bored. Slow deep inhale and slow deep exhale through your mouth. That's how I deal with it. 

I got the heart palpitations in Shot #1 right at the start, then on the third week as well before it disappeared. I got Shot #2 last Sunday and just tonight the heart palpitations returned so I'm currently doing deep breathing as I'm typing this.

Now that you know that it's something to be expected, I hope you won't fear it anymore. Just keep doing the deep breathing technique as you feel those heart palpitations and you're gonna be fine, oh and watch boring documentaries or shows while you're at it in order to help relax you (like that one channel that shows a boring aquarium with fish swimming around).",nlx9en,2021-05-27 07:42:19

I rushed back to hospital were they told me was a panick attack. After two days and thinking of this i went to a cardiologist of fearing of myocarditis my ultrasound and cardiographima was good and he told is because of anxiety. After two days again i realised my resting heart beat is alevated(usually 50-55 and now is 70)also when i get up from sofa and walk like twenty metres my heart rate goes up to 100. So again i went to a doctoe fearing about getting myoacrditis i had blood tests about troponini and other stuff of geart and nothing showed up.

"Those are actually super high odds to get hit by lightening. Like way higher than I thought. Tbh though if you are concerned about getting hit by lightening there are things you can do to drastically reduce those odds, like getting in a car or going inside if there is a storm or you know there will be a storm. I feel like people are scared even if the odds are low with these vaccine reactions because once you get the vaccine you can‚Äôt take precautions, and you don‚Äôt know the outcome until it happens. Even with covid there is a possibility of just locking yourself away to avoid it, so there is some element of perceived control. Once you get a vaccine there isn‚Äôt that. I think vaccines are so important and save lives, but I can understand why people are more scared of side effects than lightening. Also personally I never ever hear about people being struck by lightening, but we do hear about these side effects more, so it will feel scarier and more prominent even if statistically it isn‚Äôt.",nlz6jv,2021-05-27 21:03:25

"Hey there, I've had persistent headaches for three months now following my second Pfizer vaccine.  I've also had many episodes of tachycardia, pounding heartbeats, and chest pain (all tests have been normal...)  I've yet to find relief myself, even taking both ibuprofen/acetaminophen in their max safe doses.  Recently I've begun experimenting with other things myself, after the doctor's prescriptions made my migraines worse (gave me sumatriptan, which made my migraine much worse, and cyclobenzapine, saying I was 'tense' LOL).

Having a fairly decent knowledge of dysautonomia, I suspected the vaccine caused an immune response that has led to some autonomic dysregulation.  I first tried a steroid, which immediately took my headache away, though isn't something I could take long term.  I next tried pseudoephedrine, knowing that it acts on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors (also stabilized my blood pressure).  That has brought me an immediate measure of relief, too!  Though it remains to be seen for how long and whether I will develop a tolerance to it.

Sounds like a sinus infection to me.  They can be persistent and don‚Äôt always present with a fever.

I suffered a blown pupil and now experiencing persistent headaches, eye pain, brain fog and am unable to work.  I already had a diagnosis of dysautonomia so what you suggest sounds very logical to me given my medical history.

"This is not true. I utilize a plant based diet for healing my issues and it works. Steak is too fatty to allow the blood to oxygenate adequately, and liver is literally the most concentrated form of toxins you could ingest after a bucket of glyphosate. 
Supplements DO work. They can cause die-off though, which can be uncomfortable. Or you are not choosing the right ones, and the ones you've tried are either counter productive to your health or are loaded with fillers. 
Most people attempting a plant based diet simply do not eat enough. Most people you see online gravitated towards it in an effort to heal an ailment, but they are eating too much fat to allow for healing, or are not eating adequate fruit and greens. 
That being said, there is room for meat in a healing diet. It just needs to be consumed with awareness of the fat content of it.

 AFAIK the clotting is not even an issue for the mRNA vaccines, it seems ro mostly be for JNJ abd AZ. Even then, it seems to be incredibly rare. 

 And yes Myocarditis does seem to be happening rarely after vaccination from the mRNA vaccines, ironically i haven't seen any from JNJ and AZ. But from what I gather such a reaction is seen within the first 4 days, so you should be in the clear :). But of course if you have any concerns or your chest starts getting worse, i would reccomend seeing a doctor.",nlvj3c,2021-05-27 02:11:23

"Based on my personal experience this past Sunday, DEFINITELY take a few days off. I'm just starting to feel better now.

Shot #1 was ok for me, minor to moderate suffering, just the usual fever, injection site pain, headache, hard to breathe but that disappeared, nothing too serious. Shot #2 last Sunday was hell! Everything from Shot #1 was intensified. Fever was definitely horrible I felt like I was burning so I turned on the aircon, but I was also feeling chills so it was definitely a situation where I suffered either way. Surprisingly I also experienced loss of balance, as in it was hard to move. I still have a weird sense of balance right now, but I can move around much better now, but still slowly (hopefully this goes away soon I don't like this at all). The injection site pain this time was much more intensified than the first one for sure, but I still fought it by forcing my arm to move around despite the pain because that's how I made the pain go away the first time around. I also felt very weak and tired and I also had explosive diarrhea so I avoided eating as that would cause my tummy to rumble and I'd be forced to go to the toilet.

If you have some vacation days you can use from work, I honestly suggest you take the entire week off just to be sure, or if you somehow manage to feel better before five days, then just go back to work when you're sure you're feeling better.

Some people seem to make both shots sound like a walk in the park, but there are some people like me and the others who experience the really bad stuff on Shot #2. Hopefully you'll be one of the fortunate ones who will never experience the horrible things. Good luck and keep drinking water and juice to lessen the chances of suffering!",nlxr2q,2021-05-27 07:29:12

The ONLY problem linked to these vaccines is the possibility of bloodclot from j&j. Everything else people are claiming online is a lie (life threatening, not the small stuff like fevers and flu like stuff, obviously that's normal). 

Having said that, you have a tremendously larger chance of getting a clot from birth control or a long flight. Those odds are also low, but getting a clot from j&j is far far lower than that. 

Now some people have an allergy to the shot, and if you did, you would've known within 30 mins of getting it. Some people are immunocompromised. You would know if you are bc your dr would have told you. 

I'm telling you this bc I have severe anxiety and am a hypochondriac, but I still got my j&j bc I know that the crap being spread online is just that - crap. Even in this sjbreddit!

"I‚Äôm glad this was caught my daughter is 15 going to be 16 soon and just got her first shot and I would be lowing if I didn‚Äôt say I was somewhat nervous about the second. 

Im glad this is being addressed and people are being made aware of this so they know when to be concerned. I do want to caution though that for instance in the above post of 19 people in Connecticut being diagnosed isn‚Äôt really that many considering the amount of shots that have been given out and also we don‚Äôt know that the vaccine was the ultimate cause  in every case. Also the op own admission that she had the flu previously and then the vaccine. I wonder if the combination didn‚Äôt have some effect to a degree not a doctor but the fact that after 6 cases of blood clots they stopped shots of j and j immediately leads me to believe that this may not be as severe of an issue perhaps at least I hope for all of our sakes.  

The most important thing is op is ok and will more than likely be fine in the future. Another important thing is people are now aware of symptoms that can lead to a fast diagnoses and hopefully quick intervention before it‚Äôs a problem. 

I know I had read about this same thing in Israel out of something like 6-7 million vaccination they had 34 cases of myocarditis so I still think or hope rather this is very rare occurrence",nkxgx1,2021-05-26 00:34:42

"
>""It's not the spike protein that's causing the problem here.   It's the immune inflammatory response.""

The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional ""receptor"" and then enters into host cells to replicate and damage host cells and organs. ACE2 plays a pivotal role in the inflammation, and it's downregulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including promoting pathological changes in lung injury and involving inflammatory responses.
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10753-020-01337-3

It is how the spike protein interacts with the ACE2 enzyme which causes the inflammatory response by turning on the angiotensin system (which in turn increases intracellular calcium which leads to calcification and accelerated aging). The reason why aspirin reduces risk of death in COVID-19 patients is because it lowers the angiotensin system

Whatever it says on the bottle. A cold shower helped a lot when my fever started kicking in. Right now I‚Äôm feeling a lot better, I definitely believe the worst is over! Good luck!",nlhv42,2021-05-26 21:29:30
"Im proud of you! Think about what you are doing for the rest of humanity. I think the thing to keep in mind about all this that helped with my anxiety was that the majority of people will start to feel ill about 10-12 hours after their second shot. It‚Äôs going to be rough, but imagine the people that got COVID and had to feel this same thing but 10x more intense and for weeks straight. Keep telling yourself that this will all pass in 48 hours or so. The moment you get some shut eye, you will feel loads better when you wake up, so try to sleep as best as you can. Tylenol is your friend, take it when symptoms start. Cold showers help if your body starts to feel not but you aren‚Äôt feeling the chills or sweating. Definitely remember to eat or else taking Tylenol on an empty stomach will start hurting at one point. You may feel waves of discomfort but they subsided a bit for me after two hours each. 

This is all not medical advice and I‚Äôm not a trained physician. Just giving my experience and what I believe helped :)",nlhv42,2021-05-26 21:35:26
I really appreciate you saying that. It's nice to hear that rather than everyone tell me how crazy I am for getting it. I got it because I have autoimmune diseases asthma being one of them and I have kids with asthma who are prone to pneumonia. The thought of getting sick and passing it to them is terrifying. I also miss my great grandparents. I want to make sure I'm alive to raise my kids and weighing the effects of the vaccine against covid was exactly what finalized my choice. Your post definitely helped me calm my nerves. It's been 8 hrs since my second dose and so far I only feel back pain and a pain in rib cage but my back was sore beforehand so I think it just made it worse. I'll finally get to sleep if I can ever get my baby and toddler to sleep and hoping I don't wake up with symptoms. After your post I left the office and went to the store to stock up on Tylenol and ginger ale so I'm prepared for the worst just in case. Thanks so much!,nlhv42,2021-05-27 05:48:11

The trials for the mRNA vaccines were with two doses and so the paperwork and data submitted to the government bodies (FDA) are from that and that‚Äôs what was authorized.

There isnt a good answer to this. I asked people in nih in jan and couldnt get a great response. Unfortunately the trials were designed for 2 shots only so thats whats recommended. The fact that 1 shot worked so well was a secondary finding that hasnt been studied well enough and there arent current plans to study just one shot. Is one shot just as effective against the variants? We dont know. Does one shot last as long? We dont know. So get two shots until you hear different.,nl6uib,2021-05-26 11:46:57

Their first trials were for a single shot, so that's what got approved. Pfizer, Moderna and AZ all trialed 2 shots. Very likely all vaccines will need boosters at some point. I also think Pfizer and Moderna have pretty low efficacy against variants with just one dose.",nl6uib,2021-05-26 13:56:45

"Well Pfizer had two shot clinical trials so they have to continue with that. It surrounds around the basis that the long-term effects of whether it continues its efficacy past a certain time frame hasn't been research much yet, so they're not 100% sure if your immunity will last more than one year with just one shot. 

While Johnson & Johnson didn't do a booster shot in their clinical trials, so there's sufficient evidence for their vaccine at least that you don't need more than one. I'm sure that Pfizer and Moderna is sufficient with just one shot until the pandemic is basically over, but considering their clinical trials included a booster shot, that's what they need to go with until they can prove that one is sufficient enough.

In essence, it's a protocol thing. That's what they recorded, so that's what they go with.",nl6uib,2021-05-26 16:11:00
"Something I don't understand.  I read a lot about vaccines when my kids were little and my pediatrician confirmed this.  The reasoning always given for multiple shots was to cover those who didn't respond to the first shot. For instance, if one shot was given to everyone, 80% of those people develop immunity. A second shot is given to try to cover some of those 20% who didn't respond the first time. Some will never respond. They aren't going to test everyone to see which were in that 80%, so they just give everyone a second shot.  Thats not regarding boosters given years later, just vaccines given in multiple shots initially.

">This is perhaps the biggest difference with mRNA vaccines, since AstraZeneca is detected immediately by the immune system and triggers a response pretty early. I'd say these side effects are justified if I consider that already in 5 days I'll have the first antibodies (it would take 3 weeks with a mRNA jab).

Can you source that?  I'm curious why an adenovirus vectored vaccine would provide antibodies faster than an mRNA vector.",nlocla,2021-05-26 20:48:02

I know for sure that you are not supposed to take ibuprofen or any anti-inflammatories before the shot, but after is fine.

Frankly, any paracetamol that you take before the injection will probably wear off before you get any side effects, they usually don't start for 8 to 12 hours at a minimum after the injection.",nlid4i,2021-05-26 15:31:43

Why the hell is Astrazeneca still out?,nl1phs,2021-05-26 12:10:27
I wonder if this could be prevented by aspirating before injection? This used to be common practice before studies decided there was no benefit. But it would be one way of knowing whether you're sticking into a blood vessel.,nl1phs,2021-05-26 05:49:28

"I posted this as a reply to another thread, but I'll post here too: AstraZeneca is a special kind of garbage. It doesn't even encode the spike protein in the **stabilized** prefusion conformation, which means an increased risk of side effects. This, coupled with the risk that some of the vaccine might get into the blood if no aspiration is used before injecting.

small note from [this study](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.2020106267): *Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells express the Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighboring cells.

If everyone on earth got vaccinated, people would still die and get blood clots as often as they did before, only then we could make a correlation between natural occurrence of disease and illness in the general population to the vaccine.

I'm on Day 16 after my dose now, and every day since Day 10 I've had some sort of numbness and tingling during the day (and I guess at night too, but I'm sleeping, so I don't notice). The tingling doesn't last for super long periods of time (I think about 30 minutes is the usual amount of time), and it moves through different parts of my hands and feet (like my toes, and then that'll return to normal and the tingling will start in my ankle, and then that'll come back and it'll be in the palm of my hand).

Edited to add: On the other hand, I was having a GERD flare prior to the vaccine, and GERD/hiatal hernias can make your low blood sugar reactions a little worse. So it's probably that and not the vaccine.",nl8moo,2021-05-28 13:50:41

"Honestly, almost everyone I know irl has had some kind of side effect, so I‚Äôm not too surprised by the reports on here. Even the ‚Äúmild‚Äù side effects for this vaccine, like 2 days of being ill, are unusual for vaccines in general. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs surprising that some people are also having moderate - severe side effects. My mother is the only one I know that hasn‚Äôt had any side effects. My husband was sick for a week after both, my uncle vomited for a week after 1st, and my mil had flu-like symptoms for a full month and now has (it would seem permanently) worsened diabetes. Everyone I have spoken to has had some kind of side effect, whereas usually with something like a flu shot I never hear of side effects. 

Just as covid is an unusual virus, this seems to be an unusual vaccine. Just my observations, as someone who is not at all an anti-vaxxer but is rather just paying attention. I plan to have my 10 year old vaccinated when available. I‚Äôm not part of any collaborated efforts, and all the side effects I listed here 100% happened...believe them or not, doesn‚Äôt matter to me. And none of these side effects were reported to any kind of system, as they were all seen as fairly commonplace for these shots. My mil had the most extreme of anyone I know and she never reported. Regardless, I‚Äôm thrilled to see so many vaccinated and hope we will continue to see cases decline...I‚Äôm scared of a fall/winter resurgence but we‚Äôll see, and will see if there is a booster to prevent that.",nkze1r,2021-05-25 21:59:40
"Haha yes this subreddit can be informative for people to research and share their adverse reactions, but it is in of itself mostly a case of confirmation bias and paints an inaccurate representation of vaccine side effects as a whole. I just checked the numbers this morning and we are nearing 2 *billion* people worldwide who have received at least 1 dose. Knowing that, it is clear that there will statistically be cases of coincidental illnesses and even death following vaccination. 

 Though this is not to say that there will not be adverse reactions, it is only an unfortunate truth that all medications can cause complications. 

>I honestly wonder if it's a collaborated effort by the anti-vaxx crowd to upvote any and all side-effects of concern. 

 This is definitely the case in several posts. I have seen some antivax subreddits who pride themselves over seeing people in this subreddit reporting bad side rffects, and crosspost their posts onto their subreddit, in effect brigading the trolls over here and causing the post in question to get more traction. Unfortunately there is not much the mods here can do to prevent this. 

 There have also been cases of obvious lying. One comes to mind, where one man posted here claimimg to be experiencing harsh seizures after vaccination. While tragic to hear, one quick look into his profile revealed a post/comment history of antisemitic conspiracy theories, along with antivax propaganda. 

 All of the above factors give into the confirmation bias aspect. The *vast* majority of people experience mild 24 hour side effects or none at all. Any true adverse reactions trending with data is being investigated by experts, such as blood clotting in JNJ and AZ, along with Myocarditis from Pfizer and Moderna.",nkze1r,2021-05-25 22:32:59

 And in response to the whistleblower I would be more inclined to beleive and sympathize with such claims if it were  not for the source being James O'Keefe. Anything related to him or his far right ""Project Veritas"" organization has no credibility as far as Im concerned.

My dr basically has no clue what happened, especially since my echo was so long after the issues started. I am not getting my second dose.

My HR was running faster for a few days but slowly improved with time. The main issue I have now is with exercise but hoping that improves with time as well. If it makes you feel better, my cardiologist said that anything under 100 bpm (even at rest) is ""normal"" and any elevation is probably related to the immune response from the vaccine, so its not uncommon. 

Also, I found that yoga and magnesium supplements (i use one called calm) helped get me thru the first few days of higher HR. heres a video I have found really helpful:

You have legit concerns about the mRNA vaccines, and that's fine--it is new, just like the adenovirus vaccines (J&J and AZ). Even though this vaccine itself is new, it's not unknown technology. We've been working on mRNA vaccine technology for [decades](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/) and this is just the first time one (or two) has gone to market. 

mRNA vaccines are actually really simple, and that's part of the reason why we were able to get these vaccines so quickly. All it does is introduce some of your cells to RNA sequences that code for SARS-COV-2 spike proteins so that your ribosomes make those proteins and display them in the body. The immune system them attacks those proteins, and boom--you have antibodies against the actual virus. This is very similar to already established vaccines that only introduce your body to virus spike proteins, only now your body makes those spike proteins yourself instead of in a lab, which makes the vaccine quicker to manufacture. These mRNA strands stay in the cells' cytoplasm, so it doesn't affect DNA, and they fall apart quickly. 

As far as long-term effects, the same question may be posed for any vaccine--but through centuries of vaccinology and immunology, we don't think these vaccines will do any harm. [Vaccine side effects pop up within a few weeks of inoculation](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/28/health/covid-vaccine-myths-debunked/index.html), and it's been about a year since the clinical trials--and there's been no ""long-term side effects."" 

Regarding the instances of myocarditis, it's very rare. Israel, who has been mass vaccinating with the Pfizer vaccine, first raised this potential concern. For context as to how rare this appears to [be](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/05/24/heart-inflammation-coronavirus-vaccines-young-adults/):

>Some 62 people, mostly young adults, were diagnosed with the heart inflammation after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to the Times of Israel, which cited a leaked report from the Israeli Health Ministry. More than 5 million people in Israel had been vaccinated by that point.

So, 62 instances out of more than 5 million. 

Ultimately, it's your call, and just do what you're most comfortable with, but I do think you're best off going for the Pfizer shot when given the chance.",nkwv86,2021-05-25 22:37:16

Hell, there's even a COVID-19 vaccine in development that's based on the measles vaccine where Spike mRNA is delivered by the measles virus.  https://www.pnas.org/content/118/12/e2026153118  The mRNA vaccines of today use a lipid to shuttle mRNA into the cell where it's expressed, except just a single gene instead of genes coding for an entire virus.  Basically, an lipid nanoparticle with an mRNA payload can be thought of breaking down a virus to its most basic components.

WRONG.  It's injected into the muscle of the arm *precisely because* it's unlikely to end up in the blood stream, and is instead more likely to stay local or end up in the lymphatic system (which is a good thing).

That's why the deltoid has been the preferred injection site for vaccines for forever: it's far from any major blood vessels. 

The did some super sensitive assay to see if any spike protien ends up in the blood, and a bit does, but they had to use the most sensitive tech available to detect it and even then it was on the edge of the detection.  A tiny, tiny, tiny amount makes it into the blood/ends up in the liver.

">The EMA estimated that the rare side effect is being reported in 1 in 100,000 people. The UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, gave a slightly lower figure of one case for every 250,000 vaccinations. Both figures could shift as the data, as well as potential causes, are studied.

Your numbers are quite off too.

More recent study in the matter found 29 more blood clots that happened in 28 days after the vaccination than general population would have had in a sample size of 280,000 people.

That suggests 0.01% chance of having blood clots.

My guess is that ""adults"" below 30 are just as vulnerable (1 in 100 still stands), with men being slightly more vulnerable than women.

Don't dismiss the entire other side of the story because there's a possibility that some bad actors could try to influence the counter narrative in subtle ways.

>""**The rate of this myocarditis that they've seen has not.. It's not been higher**,"" Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said during a Facebook Live Tuesday. ""It's not been linked [to vaccines], but it's been one of the things that, you know, younger people very occasionally can get. And so, you know, we've advised physicians here if they were to see that to make sure that... they're reporting it."" 

>""We've not seen reports of that locally here,"" Arwady said. ""We have asked doctors just to be on the lookout if we were to see it, but this is not like when the [Johnson & Johnson vaccine] was paused. This is sort of, you know, more of just be aware in case we were to see anything, but I don't have any concerns about it based on what we've seen at this point.""

>""Within CDC safety monitoring systems, **rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates**,"" the panel stated. ""However, VaST members felt that information about reports of myocarditis should be communicated to providers.""

>The advisory panel, Arwady and other health experts noted that the **reports of myocarditis have not exceed levels normally seen prior to vaccination**.

>""Because people are getting vaccinated, it may be overlapping,"" said Dr. Richard Novak, chief of infectious diseases with University of Illinois Health. ""Right now, **they‚Äôre not seeing a greater number of myocarditis than would be expected in a young population**.‚Äù

>In fact, ‚ÄúCOVID itself could cause myocarditis in young kids,"" according to Dr. Wayne Franklin, a pediatric cardiologist with Loyola University Medical Center.

>Novak also noted that summer months bring with them a number of viruses that can cause myocarditis.

>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a whole host of viruses that are more common in the summertime - we call them enteroviruses - that are associated with myocarditis,"" he said.",nlkjel,2021-05-26 19:13:14

"I don't deny the amount of misinformation that seems to be being spread by unaware puppets that have been indoctrinated a certain anti-science mindset, or intentionally by state actors who wish to cause as much division in the country as possible.

However, r/Covidvaccinated subreddit really doesn't seem like one of the instruments that the misinformation trolls are using to spread their agenda. Many people have mild and moderate effects that cause them concern from the vaccine and post about it here. 3 people have posted here about myocarditis. Just because people are reporting adverse side effects doesn't mean that people are against public vaccination efforts.

Right now, the official sources are very well equipped to tell realistic risks of getting vaccinated because the results of phase 3 study are still coming in. Study in blood clots in a sample of 280,000 vaccinated individuals with AZ/JJ vaccine showed incident rate of blood clots of 1 in 10,000. Another American study showed incident rate of blood clots of 1 in 1.2 million on the same vaccine. 

What numbers are we supposed to believe in? People should be as aware of the benefits and adverse effects of the vaccine as possible. Right now many governments and agencies are completely dismissing and not taking seriously side effects like changes in women's cycles (clinical trials didn't even report this) and whatever else is going on in order to increase the chances of public getting vaccinated.

"Because we are looking at way too small of a time frame and not have a wholistic understanding of the situation. Has any doctor or medical professional said conclusively that ""there is zero chance of a link existing between the vaccine and myocarditis?"" No. They don't currently see a link, but that view very well may change in the near future. 

In addition, with the global vaccination efforts that are going on, having news about myocarditis being a possible rare side effect, would have somewhat significant impact on whether more people want to get vaccinated. The scientific community has the motive to stretch the truth a little bit about what background levels of myocarditis are expected to be like. 

Do you want to know a hard truth?

Both me and you will only believe whatever you and I want to believe. Even if the connection was 100% real, there would be a ton of confirmed myocarditis cases after the vaccine, but science and media would suggest that it's just a typical background level for whatever reason, you would just listen what the official narrative and 'science' says. To trust the science, doesn't mean that you always have to take what the brightest minds say at a specific moment in time.

We already had this exactly same discussion when the blood clots first came out. Oh, there's no causation, it's just background noise. Ooops, we had a tiny bit more. Oh, just 1 in 1.2 million? That's a tiny chance! Well, turns out it's more like 1 in 10,000 from AZ and JJ vaccine. But do you see how the narrative evolved? It was initially exact same argument.

Then when it came to women's cycles. Oh, it's not caused by vaccine. It's just random, what other changes have you had happen? Well, maybe there are changes, but these changes are to be expected from the increased stress levels. Science doesn't believe that the cycles can change or women in menopause can get their periods.

We know how that went. If science was completely truth worthy from the beginning, it wouldn't be science. It's science, because it's a theory and it admits the very real possibility of having distorted results or bad understanding on the subject when not much evidence exists.

Why should I trust scientists to give me accurate rates on myocarditis, when I can google blood clot rates from JJ and AZ, and I will get results like you gave me earlier of 1 in 1.2 million, and other reputable study found 1 in 10,000? How can science fuck up statistics so badly and insist that's just background levels initially?",nlkjel,2021-05-27 02:25:57
"The presence of troponin number proves that there are serious complications going on, even if its not myocarditis. And troponin isn't just something that randomly goes up. If an individual has never had issues with their troponin levels before, and all the sudden they are vaccinated and end up in ER in less than a week, it's not the craziest conclusion to say that the vaccine caused a reaction that made their troponin levels go absolutely nuts.",nlkjel,2021-05-27 02:27:53
"Those are good observations. However, I highly recommend looking at other kind of outlets than youtube if you are trying to get an accurate idea of anything.

YouTube comments are well known to be one of the most toxic places in all of humanity, and if you look at what news clips about Hillary before election looked like in the comment section, or even what comment section in youtube looks like when a black person gets shot by police, you realize that there's just way too much stupidity to have any intellectual conversation. 

My theory is that a lot of people just are recommended these kinds of videos, and the ones that are zealous and anti-science, always click them, dislike them, find their kind in the comments, and make a dumpster fire.

Youtube comments and biases against science are completely different from Reddit. The biases still exist. For example, go on r/politics and try to find a single news article from Fox News that wasn't downvoted to hell. I'm not saying that because I like Fox, but just showing that the echo chamber mentality is all over different subreddits too.

If you have a place like r/covidvaccinated where you have different belief systems coming together in a non-echochambery way, we shouldn't insist that the side that we don't agree with is fabricating material just to make us completely dismiss what they have to say. You don't see me claiming on my post history that covid symptoms are fake, or that people are posting positive experiences on the sub to make others get vaccinated. I don't believe that.

However, many individuals who are pro-covid vaccine, keep insisting that many of the accounts here are not real or selection bias is to be blamed for why a sizable amount of adverse effects are being presented. Without offering a single drop of proof of their theories.",nlkjel,2021-05-27 02:35:53

[https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728)  


This is a Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals.  
  
The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s); Phase 2/3: an expanded cohort and efficacy part.  
  
The study will evaluate the ***safety***, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3 different SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 and the efficacy of 1 candidate:  
  
As a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule;  
At various different dose levels in Phase 1;  
As a booster;  
In 3 age groups (Phase 1: 18 to 55 years of age, 65 to 85 years of age; Phase 2/3: ‚â•12 years of age \[stratified as 12-15, 16-55 or >55 years of age\]).  
The candidate selected for efficacy evaluation in Phase 2/3 is BNT162b2 at a dose of 30 ¬µg.

Estimated Primary Completion Date  :	October 29, 2021

"Scroll down to the Primary Outcome Measures section of that link.  Look at the ""Time Frame"" for each measure.

There are only two measures with data collected for more than 1 year, both efficacy (and not safety) related:

* Confirmed COVID-19 in Phase 2/3 participants without evidence of infection before vaccination [ Time Frame: From 7 days after the second dose of study intervention to the end of the study, up to 2 years ]
* Confirmed COVID-19 in Phase 2/3 participants with and without evidence of infection before vaccination  [ Time Frame: From 7 days after the second dose of study intervention to the end of the study, up to 2 years ]

There are five with data collection for 6 months after second dose, all of which are safety related, and all of which have expired (Phase 3 started Jul 27, 2020) and the data has already been crunched:

* Percentage of participants in Phase 1 reporting serious adverse events [ Time Frame: From dose 1 through 6 months after the last dose ]  *(phase 1 is long over)*
* In the first 360 participants randomized into Phase 2/3, percentage of participants reporting serious adverse events [ Time Frame: From dose 1 through 6 months after the last dose ]
* Percentage of participants in Phase 2/3 reporting serious adverse events [ Time Frame: From dose 1 through 6 months after the last dose ]
* Percentage of participants 12-15 years of age in Phase 3 reporting adverse events [ Time Frame: From dose 1 through 6 months after the last dose ]
* In participants who receive BNT162b2SA given as 1 or 2 doses, percentage of participants reporting serious adverse events [ Time Frame: From dose 1 through 5 or 6 months after the last dose ]
* In participants who receive a third dose of BNT162b2, percentage of participants reporting serious adverse events [ Time Frame: From the third dose through 6 months after the third dose ]

The last 2 are studying 3 doses, which is irrelevant to the current vaccination protocol the public is following.

It's not like they sit on the data they finished collecting until 2023.  That data was analyzed, the vaccines were determined to be safe, which is why they received EUA.

1. Talk to your physicist. Explain your fears and ask them to give you a realistic view. Maybe get a second or third opinion. Ask what symptoms to look out for after the shot.

"I'm not suggesting that this is the cause but given how the vaccine elicits an immune response, a dietary change might help kickstart your body to right itself. How's your electrolyte intake pre and post vaccine? Brain fog, lack of concentration, immense fatigue can be caused by an electrolyte imbalance which might have been exacerbated by an immune response. You might want to try hydrating more with a balanced mixture of salts other than sodium (make sure whatever electrolyte you're drinking has magnesium and potassium). You'll also want to supplement calcium. Also drink a lot of broth. I would also suggest cutting out heavily processed carbs in favor of complex carbs from veggies. Also supplement with fats like avocado and coconut.",nk2asq,2021-05-25 00:00:40

It was hard not to feel defeated.

I know each individual is different I hope everyone feeling this way can find some peace. I have been very successful with deep breathing and guided meditation healthy eating etc. 

All vaccines have side effects I feel like anxiety and depression prone people may experience more issues than a person that doesn‚Äôt so I‚Äôm always trying to pay close attention to the fact that I could get into a kind of head space thats hard to get out of and prepare myself as much as possible mentally with tools to over come it.

Also no matter how long I try to sleep in and appease my tiredness. I'm still tired after. I dont understand it. It has me pretty stressed out. Because I wonder if its ever going away.

"I am someone with terrible health anxiety (like truly, debilitating) so I feel your concern. I don't want to hide that I am definitely pro-vax, but I will say that several of my family members had swollen lymph nodes and they went down about a month after they got the second vaccine, and they haven't had any other lasting side effects! Having seen friends/family get Covid, I was equally anxious about contracting it and getting the vaccine, but now that I got both doses I don't regret it. 

I actually had some other weird side effects days after getting my second dose with my vision, but it turns out that blurred vision is actually a known side effect of a medication I have been taking, which I'm now tapering off. Swollen lymph nodes aside, if it is other ""horror"" stories that are scaring you, I can now say from personal experience that correlation does not = causation, and that many documented unusual vaccine side effects are likely caused by intersecting (and possibly unrelated!) factors. 

anyway, don't let people bully you either way, but if you are someone who struggles with health anxiety, I would try to talk to additional reputable sources (do you have friends in health care??) before you make a decision either way, rather than relying on highly opinionated reddit posters. =) I hope your anxiety about this improves regardless--I know how difficult it can be.",njzyft,2021-05-24 21:07:40

I plan to revisit possibly getting dose 2 in a couple months once I don't have so much going on. I am still glad that I got the initial dose.

Only if you have a symptomatic infection.  If you are vaccinated and don't have any symptoms, you can't pass it on (or are *astronomically* unlikely to).  Hence the recent ""you can go maskless if you're vaccinated"" guidance.

>You speak with such conviction, as like you know.

I sure do.  Vaccines do not show new side effects more than a month or two after vaccination.  Period.

>In all honesty, the truth is nobody actually knows the long term effects as the clinical trials don't end until 2024.

There are trials ongoing for all kinds of fully-approved drugs, all the time, to try to figure out if dosing or dose spacing differences can increase (or decrease) efficacy.  For example, *I'm in* the J&J trial that goes to 2023.  They wanted to see if 2 doses of J&J, spaced 8 weeks apart, is better than one dose.  The trial is testing if it is or not.  

Do not assume any ongoing trial means that we do not know the safety and efficiacy profile of a drug/vaccine, because we do.  These later trials are to fine-tune our knowledge.

> So not to be biased, there is risk on both sides - long covid AND very undesirable reactions to the vaccine, which there have been quite a few with varying levels of seriousness.

>The answer is absolutely not. The mechanisms of VITT is very idiosyncratic. Just because you have a history of blood clots doesn‚Äôt mean you are going to have VITT. And because you‚Äôve had a blood clot, your risk of getting thrombosis from COVID is higher. Your background risk of getting VITT is 1 in 1.3 million with the vaccine, but your risk of getting a blood clot from COVID is higher. There‚Äôs an imbalance ‚Äì you are at a much higher risk of getting thrombosis from COVID, versus the vaccine.

"The thinking is they‚Äôre really similar. If a study shows one of them is highly effective against x variant, the other one very likely is very similar. 

A difference, though, is that the Pfizer shot is 30 ¬µg while the Moderna is over three times larger at 100 ¬µg. This dosage increase over Pfizer without notable efficacy differences in the clinical trials may mean Pfizer‚Äôs mRNA technology is more streamlined. 

There are also some studies that may show that Pfizer recipients experience less and less severe side effects, although obviously everyone reacts differently and the best you can do is guess.

Since you said both vaccine regiments are 4 weeks apart, I‚Äôm assuming your government is spacing the doses out like that. Otherwise, the Pfizer vaccine doses are 3 weeks apart, like during the clinical trials and here in the U.S. and elsewhere, so you get fully vaccinated a week earlier, but that depends on your government‚Äôs vaccine distribution.

Figure 3 shows the proportion of cases in the vaccinated and placebo groups. The big split appeared after day 10.

"Note that Figure 3 is from the **first shot**.  OP has had the second shot, and so was maybe exposed at day 25 (21 + 4 days).  He's got decent protection, although not as much as it would be at 7 days past the second.  It's hard to tell exactly how much, though.  From the data in that report:

* Between the first shot and the second shot, 82 people in the placebo group had symptomatic covid while 39 in the vaccinated group got it (both groups had over 21,000 people each).  Note that this is counting from day zero, and so the vaccine hasn't had time to even start to kick in.  If you look at the zoomed-in graph, the (symptomatic) infection curves diverge around day 11.  If you subtract a minimum of 2 days for the incubation period, this suggests Pfizer can provide protection starting around day 9 (and maybe earlier for some people).

* Between 2-7 days after the **second** shot, 21 people in the placebo group got symptomatic covid, while only 2 in the vaccinated group did.  Keep in mind that both groups had over 21,000 people each, for a total of well over 42,000.

"The rtPCR technology is not effective for diagnosis, a fact noted by Kary Mullis who won the Nobel Prize for inventing it. Paraphrasing him, if you crank up the sensitivity high enough, you can find virtually anything in anyone.

PCR technology is useful for creating a lot of a biological sample from a very small amount. The testing using PCR tech involves amplifying a tiny sample over and over and trying to detect the target molecule. Each amplification, termed a ""cycle"", doubles the amount of the sample. A certain number of cycles that a sample is put through is called the ""cycle threshold"". After each cycle, the amplified sample is tested for the target. If the target is detected, the test is considered ""positive"" at that cycle threshold.

When the threshold is high, though, the sensitivity is such that the presence in the original sample of a mere viral fragment or intact, yet dead, virion can trigger a positive result. Yet the virus cannot be cultured from the sample. If it cannot be cultured, it is not live and cannot cause disease.

God-King Fauci has stated that samples cannot be cultured when the cycle threshold reaches the mid-30s. A study of the first 100 covid patients in Singapore found that all attempts to culture failed when CT was above 30. Other studies, pre-covid, have suggested that only around 3% of samples are culturable when CT is over 25. Note that, because each amplification cycle approximately doubles the amount of material, a CT of 35 is testing a sample over 1,000 times larger than is a CT of 25.

Across America and, likely other countries, tests were run up to cycle thresholds of 45 and most testing agencies refused to disclose at which particular cycle a specific sample tested positive.

Here‚Äôs an FDA doc that provides some info on the above. I urge you to read it at your leisure. [https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download)

Some highlights:

‚Äî Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.

‚Äî This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.

The above should show that I know what I am talking about when it comes to the flaws inherent in using rtPCR tech as a diagnostic tool. As to the purposeful over-counting of covid deaths, I offer the following.

"You have dismissed actual evidence out of hand and offered little but anecdotes in rebuttal. You are exceedingly disingenuous.

It's interesting that you bring up Russia. I can offer my own anecdotes about taht. My wife was born and raised in Russia and still has family and many friends there. Almost all of them disbelieve the numbers claimed as they have great experience with government propaganda and the claims do not comport with what they are seeing. Quite a few know of people who have a friend or family member who passed away over the last year where they were listed as killed by covid when this was a half-truth, at best.

As for the single point of evidence you provided in your other, equally weak reply, my argument above already deals with their claims. Their website states, ""Both guidelines state that if the practitioner suspects that COVID-19 played a role in an individual‚Äôs death it should be specified on the death certificate. In some cases, COVID-19 may be the¬†underlying¬†cause of death, having led to complications such as pneumonia or ARDS. Even when it‚Äôs the underlying and not the direct cause, COVID-19 should be listed.""

This statement actually lends credence for my assertions about the over-counting of COVID deaths. However, ourworldindata claims that this means that deaths are actually under-counted, with no rationale nor proof of this. In fact, this method of tabulating the cause of death has NEVER been used before and was implemented solely for COVID. The CDC changed, on March 24 of 2020, the methodology for recording the cause of death for, exclusively, COVID. This changed a methodology that had been in place for 17 years, but only with respect to the counting of COVID deaths and not for any other causes. This change was done without public comment or peer review which, likely, makes it illegal, as is described in this linked paper. ([https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864\_411c766e79174b17b8911fcae08722b1.pdf](https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_411c766e79174b17b8911fcae08722b1.pdf)) Lawsuits based on this potentially illegal action are wending their way through the court system.

The linked paper is months old so some of its cited statistics are out of date. It notes that the CDC reported last August that just 6% of all COVID deaths counted at that time had COVID listed as the only cause. For the rest, on average there were 2.6 co-morbidities. The most recent CDC update on this that I have seen has reduced the number of COVID-only deaths to just over 5% and increased the average number of co-morbidities per death to just under 4. Note, too, that the CDCs data counts as a COVID death those with such co-morbidities as ‚Äúvehicular collision‚Äù, ‚Äúgunshot wound‚Äù, and ‚Äúaccidental poisoning‚Äù.

Nope, they stay stuck on the cells that produced them (in your deltoid muscle).

>Now we get to a key difference: when a cell gets the effect of an mRNA nanoparticle or an adenovirus vector, it of course starts to express the Spike protein. But instead of that being assembled into more infectious viral particles, as would happen in a real coronavirus infection, this protein gets moved up to the surface of the cell, where it stays. That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs presented to the immune system, as an abnormal intruding protein on a cell surface. The Spike protein is not released to wander freely through the bloodstream by itself, because it has a transmembrane anchor region that (as the name implies) leaves it stuck. That‚Äôs how it sits in the virus itself, and it does the same in human cells. See the discussion in this paper on the development of the Moderna vaccine, and the same applies to all the mRNA and vector vaccines that produce the Spike. You certainly don‚Äôt have the real-infection situation of Spike-covered viruses washing along everywhere through the circulation. **The Spike protein produced by vaccination is not released in a way that it gets to encounter the ACE2 proteins on the surface of other human cells at all: it‚Äôs sitting on the surface of muscle and lymphatic cells up in your shoulder, not wandering through your lungs causing trouble.**

DNA and RNA are **everywhere** - there's actually a kind of [ecological experiment that can measure biodiversity from water or samples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_DNA).

The reason why mRNA vaccines need to be kept at low temperature is because the nanotechnology needed to get mRNA inside cells is quite fragile. Once the vaccine spoils the mRNA is still mostly present, but it's no longer biologically active.

It's just a source of nutrition for whatever decides to digest and decompose it.

Yeah.  Read the paper.  It's pg/ml.  The detection limit of commercially available antigen testing is 5-25ng/ml for actual infection.  They used a method that's 1000x more sensitive.  For perspective of how low the levels are, for Spike protein at that concentration to cause any severe damage, it would need to be more deadly than basically all but the most deadliest poison known to mankind (Botulinum toxin).  It would be over 2000 to 2 million times (depending on inhalation or oral dosing) more deadly than ricin.  There would be billions of people dead if Spike protein at that concentration caused any effect given that the commercial test detects levels 1000 times higher.

"Hey there!

I also suffer from health anxiety, so I definitely know what you are going through. It's really hard to separate the anxiety symptoms for the ""real"" ones. 

I have a similar story with the vaccine. Around the 10th day after my 1st Pfizer shot I started to feel some kind of weird arm pain (not a muscle related pain and moving my arm did not have much effect on it) and I also had an ulcer like wound just where I got the shot. The pain worsened over time and I developed a buzzing sensation in my arm alongside some weakness and occasionally pins and needles feeling. My arm fell asleep easily every night, first I thought that I slept on it in a weird position like you, but eventually I realized that it goes numb in almost every position. These feelings appeared in my leg too on the same side, my leg has not gone completely numb, but I often has the feeling like it's ""humming"" or buzzing + some discomfort just like as if it went asleep and woke up after going numb.   
I was going crazy from the fear and anxiety, I could see myself being completely disabled. One day my symptoms worsened and my arm and hand had gone numb even from just sitting or lying on my back, it only felt normal during standing. I freaked out, had a hardcore panic attack and went to the ER, but they almost laughed at me and sent me home (Eastern Europe at its best, I love it :D). When I calmed down, my symptoms improved a bit, but my arm had the same shaky/buzzing feeling and my arm went asleep too easily.   
I went to see a neurologist, because I even suspected MS or brain tumor, but she said it was a relatively common reaction to the vaccine. It is neuropathy and it is caused by the overly active immune system and it will slowly go away on its own. It's much like post-covid syndrome.  
At last I could calm down after this visit and tried to ignore my symptoms.  
Don't get me wrong, the neuropathy is pretty much real but even I am surprised how the change in my attitude made the symptoms MUCH less severe. I have barely even noticed them since and I had the courage to get the second shot (my GP and the neurologist said it was safe to get it). I realized that panicking made the symptoms worse, everything that elevates my heart rate and BP or make my muscles tense have made it worse even if I didn't want to believe it first. 

tl;dr: These symptoms can be absolutely real vaccine side effects, but they most likely are harmless and you can easily make them much worse with anxiety.",nk9sx7,2021-05-26 22:26:22

"Mine was very intense. It lasted a long time, and it was constant for six weeks. My skin was tingling, it felt like it was burning, and I had numbness also on my calves and my face. I had this like Charlie horse ache in my arms. Ice pick migraines every day. Twitching. My shot was early March. At the time I couldn‚Äôt find anybody else who had this so I felt scared. I have spent a lot of time reading on this subReddit, and I have now seen numerous people experience this. Some of them went on to get their second shot, and while it persisted after the second shot as well, it did eventually go away with no lasting side effects. I think I‚Äôm going to go ahead and get my second, but I am not quite ready yet.",nk9sx7,2021-05-24 23:30:36

Yes basically that. I put headphones on and cranked the music up, played some games, afterwards i realized that entire time I never noticed my arm tingling. Does it go away for you or is it constant? 


>How strong was the tingling that you were feeling?

 The initial tingling was very strong, but that was just when it was in its ""waking up"" phase. Other than that it was faint. Also something to consider is if your wrist/arm was asleep, you may have been sleeping on it in a bad position and potentially caused carpal tunnel, which can cause arm tingliness but also pain. 


>And do you have any advice / methods of dealing with health anxiety?

 I wish lol, this subreddit was a massive trigger at first but I learned to overcome it by researching and talking with people on here. Learning to filter out the lies and the truth of antivaxxers trying to scare people. But thats just for vaccine related stuff, i still struggle with other portions of health anxiety so i cant give advice on much else. Sorry :/.

Massaging my limbs helped. Working out and walking helped some.  But nothing made it go away except time. Many people went to neurologists and tried lyrica (for nerve pain) and did extensive testing.

"The vaccine drastically reduces your chances of getting COVID. Vaccinated people are unlikely to get COVID. Yes, some people get COVID after being vaccinated.

I am not aware of a significant difference between Moderna and Pifzer. I heard Pfizer has fewer sd ffcts, but l know people who got both, and they all had little to no side effcts.",nkg2oo,2021-05-25 05:01:54
"Pfizer and Moderna are almost identical. They are both roughly 95% effective. Moderna might have a bit more side effects and the wait between shots is 4 weeks while Pfizer is 3 weeks. In the long run though they appear indistinguishable.

Johnson and Johnson is a different type of vaccine, it‚Äôs a technology we have been using for years while the MRNA vaccines are new. The J&J shot has a minute risk of blood clots, mainly in women of childbearing age. The efficacy is closer to 70%, but it‚Äôs not fair to do a direct comparison to the other shots. Some people who have gotten J&J are testing positive (see the Yankees) but are almost entirely asymptomatic. 

In the end J&J you will probably be just as safe as Moderna and Pfizer but I do wonder if in communities with a heavy presence of J&J if the spread won‚Äôt slow as rapidly, even if positive vaccinated people end up feeling fine.",nkg2oo,2021-05-25 05:27:44
"The vaccines have, at most, 95% efficacy. Its never been claimed that they‚Äôre 100% effective at preventing covid. Just like a flu shot, you can still get the virus, it‚Äôs just less likely. It‚Äôs worth getting them because of how much they lower your risk of getting covid. You‚Äôre also significantly less likely to have a severe case of covid if you‚Äôre fully vaccinated. It doesn‚Äôt matter which one you get. Get whatever you‚Äôre offered as soon as possible",nkg2oo,2021-05-25 04:44:33
"The FDA requires a vaccine to have at least 50% efficacy. All of the vaccines have well above that. They were all tested in different settings, on different patient groups, and with different strains circulating, making it almost possible to compare efficacy numbers. If I'm not mistaken, there was a study that found that the Astra Zeneca vaccine (76% reported efficacy) was more effective than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (95% reported efficacy) in a real-life setting. I'm sure there are other studies that show the opposite. The takeaway is that they are all extremely effective, well beyond what anyone would have expected going into this.",nkg2oo,2021-05-25 13:55:01
"I think there is a tiny amount of people who don't build antibodies. It is extremely low about .01%. Many of these have autoimmune diseases or completed a treatment like chemo.

All the shots are good. I had Pfizer, which may cause fewer hang over type sensations post shots and good stats on people not developing even mild symptoms, but when you vaccinate a billion people, you are going to get a good spectrum of reactions.",nkg2oo,2021-05-25 04:50:25

There is a statement in the Pfizer and Moderna safety facts sheets  that claims those who have had COVID may experience more severe side effects. And those 55 and under may experience more side effects. You and your GF fall into both of those categories. Glad you are both doing better.,njg3uh,2021-05-23 21:56:00
"Sounds exactly like what happened to my husband and his second Moderna shot. He had a high fever for a few days that got up to 104, intense chills and shivering, and so much body aches. We knew about the second shot sickness and stocked up on gatorade , water and meds. Our son and I are getting our second Pfizer shot next week and we're both dreading it because all three of us had COVID last year and it was hell. Probably going to take meds right when we get home. Hydrating is supposed to help a great deal with the symptoms from the second shot. 

I'm glad the both of you are ok now, and your bodies did what they were meant to do and in two weeks you guys will be more protected. Hindsight is a bitch, but others can learn. Don't coverup too much when you have a high fever, a sheet is really all you need. Take meds when you start getting up there in body temp, sip on water as much as you can and use cooling rags on your forehead/core (if you can stand it).

Also, reading from 104-106 temp has me worried for you, it sounds like febrile seizure territory,",njg3uh,2021-05-24 01:25:43
"Very well written, I feel like I was experiencing that with you. I wish you had known to take acetaminophen and then ibuprofen far earlier that night, it would've dulled the peak of your symptoms and likely made it less terrible. They can be combined, AFAIK (but check to be safe), and both will reduce fever and those kinds of aches and pains. Maybe even reduce the nausea. You could've also tried a food that was far easier to digest, like applesauce, yogurt, a few crackers, and drinking Pedialyte or Gatorade.

I suspect you both had such intense reactions because you're young and previously had COVID. Both of those things seem correlated with more intense reactions to the second shot (based on anecdotal data, at least), and it makes sense: your bodies thought they saw a sudden and massive infection and treated it like a critical situation. Your immune system probably is congratulating itself on its intense reaction, as it wiped out the ""infection"" extremely quickly (as the spike proteins stopped being generated once the mRNA was all transcribed).",njg3uh,2021-05-23 22:22:28

">Don't coverup too much when you have a high fever, a sheet is really all you need

So true yet such difficult advice to follow! When I get really high fever, anything under my body temperature feels extremely cold. Standing up in my room at 70 degrees felt like I was walking through the arctic, and lying down without a thick sheet made me feel like I was sickly and freezing and the only thing that could comfort me was wrapping myself up in a very thick blanket.

When I did wrap up, my body temp started to climb... that was the issue. So when I was hitting 106, I had to shed blankets and force myself to feel deathly cold... just to get back down to 103 or 102, then repeat the cycle to alleviate the pain of the cold.

Sometimes in the past I would give in to the temptation and take a hot bath, which VERY quickly became unbearable- body temp probably spiked really fast at that point. 

The small window of time after I got out of the bath, I would air dry and cool down and my body would forget it had a fever. I was still hot but cooling down felt good, and for 5 or 10 minutes it provides amazing relief, until your body temp gets low enough to trigger the fever chills and then the cycle continues.

> Also, reading from 104-106 temp has me worried for you, it sounds like febrile seizure territory,

There were some moments from 6 to to 7 AM where I felt like my memory was skipping around but I attributed it to the delirium of the fever. Now, I really hope those weren't micro-seizures due to the very high body temp. It's not like anyone was monitoring me... no frothing at the mouth, though, so that's good!",njg3uh,2021-05-24 02:42:08
">I wish you had known to take acetaminophen and then ibuprofen far earlier that night, it would've dulled the peak of your symptoms and likely made it less terrible.

"This is interesting. Yes, somehow the most comforting thing to me was knowing that all this was just an immune response from the shot, and that once the transcription was over everything would stop as suddenly as it began.

The worst thing was how cocky we got the night before when all we felt was some soreness. I ate a big Mac at 10 before we went to sleep, and the entire night I was cursing myself and tasting it in the back of my throat. I don't think I can eat McDonald's for at least a week or two now, the mere thought of it is still bringing back nausea.

Had we had known, i would have been quicker to draw out the medication and, like you said, I would have eaten extremely light and friendly foods as to minimize nausea.

The only reason I was hesitant to pull out the ibuprofen was due to reports that it can dull the immune response and reduce efficacy of the vaccine.",njg3uh,2021-05-23 22:38:53

I actually would have gone to the ER (have medicaid) but I knew that by forcing myself to move around, being in a cold vehicle, walking into the ER etc would have been REALLY painful in my position AND would have cooled down my temps so I'd have been closer to 103. At that point they'd have given me ibuprofen and sent me home.

Also, with your head RIGHT over the bowl as you stand up, you are breathing in pure pee fumes... I don't get why more guys don't pee sitting down. It's so superior lmao, you get to rest as you pee, you don't make a mess, it's way cleaner, you're not breathing/smelling pee fumes and wiping your tip is 100% easier

For example, I still have antibodies after *14 months* - is it really that urgent for me to get vaccinated when I already have circulating antibodies and learned/protective immunity?

I can only imagine how bad \~60F night air would have felt

Maybe the ibuprofen was what helped, but for me, like clockwork, any time I'm sick at night with a bad fever, daybreak just helps bring it down by a couple of degrees. I read up on it and it appears that  it's due to cykotines being active at night, and less so during the day, but I'm not sure.

I do know that when I had covid in Feb 2020 (if that is what I had), I was running a fever for 5 days straight, and it would spike up at night (not as bad as this), and go down during the day, and I was popping 800MG of ibuprofen every 24 hours on the dot with no change",njg3uh,2021-05-24 02:28:15

I find it odd that doctors are struggling to connect the dots on these things. Any viral infection that triggers a strong inflammatory response can trigger these conditions. Common things like strep or hand-foot-mouth can cause the same response, so it should take no great leap to believe that a vaccine that creates an inflammatory response can do the same.

"Hi, I got the Pfizer shot on April 8th and had a massive delayed inflammatory response that seemed to start around April 23rd. It started to calm down a bit around the middle of May (the 10th more or less). (And by calm down, I mean, it went from 10/10 pain to 6/10 more regularly). 

I didn't realize it was a side effect from the vaccine (I assumed my spine was just getting worse because of my scoliosis) until it started to calm down unfortunately or I would have reached out to my doctor sooner.

Some people have gotten steroids for similar reactions and said a 5 day course seemed to help somewhat. Some people said it returned after. My pain seemed to flare up the other day again with my menstrual cycle (which triggered inflammation again) but has calmed down more since. I have seen a few other posts that said this specific adverse response seems to take around 8 weeks to resolve. 

I speak with my doctor at the beginning of June & would urge you to talk to your doctor as soon as you can before it gets out of control for you. I have suffered a lot by not being able to speak with my doctor. I am still dealing with this (amongst other side effects) on and off but it does seem to be slowly improving. It's been almost 7 weeks since my first shot. My second isn't scheduled until the end of July and I am on the fence about getting it.

I have found eating an anti-inflammatory diet, fish oil capsules, and walking have helped reduce the inflammation a certain amount. I've also been taking anti-inflammatories daily.",njtqln,2021-05-24 15:09:01

Urgent care ran an ekg that was normal and my heart rate went down. They diagnosed me with anxiety even though my anxiety never presented with heart problems before. Since then my heart rate has been normal but I‚Äôve had frequent heart palpitations followed with occasional accompanying pain. I went to my PCP and told her about the palpitations and the really bad brain fog (balloon like feeling) that also was plaguing me and was sent for a thyroid panel.
I was diagnosed with hashimoto‚Äôs hypothyroidism (an autoimmune disease) after that panel. To be clear, I never had any of these problems prior to this.

"Thank you ALL for the replies and comments. Just wanted to post a brief update - hoping that others who might be experiencing prolonged, severe reactions find threads like this and realize they are not alone.

Visited my primary care doctor and a cardiologist last week.

Overall, my heart and blood tests were ""normal enough"", indicating (from the doctor's perspective) I'm not at serious risk of something life-threatening such as heart attack, blood clot etc. So overall, that is great. However, it is frustrating in that the overall attitude of medical professionals is to try and find every reason to tell me that what I'm experiencing is NOT SERIOUS, and NOT FOR SURE caused by the vaccine. When I am 100% POSITIVE that it IS A RESULT of the vaccine. 

My symptoms still remain. 24 days since second Pfizer shot, and still have two main problems: 1) myocardial inflammation around the heart, and 2) inflammation/pressure around the ears leading to prolonged headaches, sensitivity to LED light/ loud noises, and what I would describe as some dizziness/disorientation. 

Their final explanation is that I'm having a hyperactive immune response to the vaccine, causing well-above-average inflammation around the heart (no pre-existing conditions at all), and in the ears/head (have some minor pre-existing conditions and troubles with ears in the past - but have never had bad headaches). No real prescription or treatment besides Advil (1,200 mg per day) and rest. 

I am attempting to get a 24-48 hour monitor. And if the headaches don't become more manageable I will soon request a stronger, prescription medication to try and manage. Because this is now becoming a long-term problem with work. Not sure if anyone has any recommendations or advice related to that.",njpbin,2021-05-31 21:38:45

Ask for a 24hr or 48hr Holter Monitor. It's a device that connects electrodes to your body and then monitors your heart. Basically a portable ECG.

"Your HR issue sounds like what I have...it is called Super Ventricular Tachycardia. Essentially, if you have an electrical pathway in your heart (alot of people do and dont realize it) you can experience these episodes where your heart sort of short circuits and causes a fast HR at rest. These episodes can be triggered by a ton of things such as infection, alcohol, stress or even thyroid issues. I had not had any issues for a while but the shot triggered a few for me. 

If it makes you feel better, SVT is a fairly benign condition even though in the moment it is terrifying. Check out vasovagal maneuvers...I use them to stop the attack and bring my HR down. Hoping you feel better soon.",njpbin,2021-05-26 20:03:34

">I have been hearing that if the coronavirus modifies (or mutates) its spike protein, it wont be able to attach to the respiratory epithelial cells, hence it will lose its pathogenicity. Is this statement true?

No.  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to ACE2 receptor.  The area of the spike protein that binds is called the receptor binding domain (RBD) and within that RBD is the receptor binding motif (RBM) which are the amino acids involved in the actual binding.  Amino acids in the RBD and within the RBM have already mutated in some variants and are still capable of binding to ACE2, some with increased efficiency.  In fact, mutation favors increased binding efficiency toward ACE2.  To get complicated, the free energy of the binding reaction of Spike and ACE2 was high in the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2.  As it has mutated, the free energy of the binding interaction has been decreasing which is the favored state.  Each decrease in free energy has been associated with increased binding efficiency.",njuol6,2021-05-24 15:20:23

">So, this means, the vaccines have a short life and will need to be upgraded from time to time.

Possibly.  Depends on if there's an escape mutant.

>Why a consensus on how much level of antibodies needed for seroprotection hasn't been determined till date?

Because you'd need to detect neutralizing antibodies, not just total antibodies.  We can guess based on IC50 of cell lines vs antibody titers.  But, there's more than that going on.  SARS-CoV-2 has some immune evasion going on so it's often hard to test how much is needed for an infectious dose in an actual human.",njuol6,2021-05-24 21:09:58

Yeah, we should stop touching them (lol), but it‚Äôs a little scary regardless of it being a semi-common side-effect. 

Weirdness...and same with injection discomfort, and not every day, just at odd times a few times per week and exactly where I got the shot (which seemed higher on my shoulder than normal vaccines, like flu). Still would rather have this than Covid.  

Update when yours goes away.  I hear it can take weeks to months to never quite gone.  If mine lasts another month, I‚Äôll probably go get it checked out.  Either way, it was definitely not there before the second shot, and I noticed it about 5-6 days after it.  Good luck!",njqprm,2021-05-24 23:39:02

"This isn‚Äôt going to answer your question, but I have also been struggling with the pins and needles in my hands and feet ever since my second dose of Pfizer. I also have random sensation changes throughout my body, like for instance, I‚Äôll have a zing of ‚Äúcold‚Äù go through my face or my leg. Mine is random and doesn‚Äôt last more than a few minutes at a time now but initially it lasted two weeks after my shot and was absolutely miserable. My immunologist also thinks it is from the vaccine. I have had trouble with inflammation (in my sinuses) for a long time now and he told me my immune system revved up to ‚Äúfight‚Äù off the vaccine and just had a hard time shutting down which increased the inflammation throughout my body causing the pins and needles. I got a steroid shot about a month ago and it helped tremendously. I‚Äôve been increasing my workouts and eating a more anti inflammatory diet and that‚Äôs been helping too. I‚Äôll be doing a two week full anti Inflammation diet here in a week or so and I‚Äôm hoping to see improvements with that. I‚Äôm not a medical doctor, so I certainly can‚Äôt tell you what‚Äôs best for you, but I will say, knowing how my body reacted to the first rounds of the vaccines, I won‚Äôt be getting a booster if there is one. I 100% support vaccination for people who tolerate it well, but when you know your bodies reaction isn‚Äôt favorable, I personally think it‚Äôs best to just skip it and hope more people opt to take it to help protect those that can‚Äôt.",njmhm3,2021-05-24 14:49:04
"Hi, I‚Äôm still dealing with side effects from first dose of moderna. Currently I‚Äôm regretting getting the shot so soon (as soon as I became eligible April 15), my gut feeling told me to wait until there was more research but I felt a lot of pressure from family, coworkers and friends so I did it. I been to 2 doctors, 1 allergist, 1 rheumatologist and now waiting on an appointment with a neurologist, they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, I have arm pain, pins and needles and the injection site gets red and warm still. This time I‚Äôm following my gut feeling and not getting the second dose until I feel ready.

Hoping the best for you! I‚Äôm glad you were able to come to a conclusion that was right for you.

A week after the shot I started to develop the pins and needles in both hands and feet and it was SO bad. I couldn‚Äôt even sleep. I took magnesium supplements and drank Nuun for electrolytes as well as iced and elevated my extremities (all recommended by my PCP) which helped quite a bit. All the pins and needles went away. About a month later I started getting the pins and needles and sensation changes again but not nearly as bad as the first time. That‚Äôs when I saw my immunologist and got the steroid shot.

I saw an allergist/immunologist and had them run allergy testing- which was negative. I‚Äôm currently seeing a GI doc. Trying to find some answer on what to do with the second dose via Dr./Health Dept/CDC has been hard. I‚Äôm in the medical field, not an anti-vaxer ...with that being said I would take second dose- if I had more information or understanding as to what caused my issues. So for now, I‚Äôll just wait. In the meantime- maybe those of us with these symptoms should reach out to this Dr on this case study? Maybe, he has more data or we can help him obtain more.
 I am sorry you are going through this. I hope you continue to improve.

"One answer I cannot find while researching the vaccine is where the mRNA goes after injection and what cells are producing the spike protein. It could very well be that in a small number of people the vaccine is inadvertently injected into a vein or blood vessel and then the cells of the heart, brain, liver, etc. are up taking some of the mRNA and then producing the spike. If the cells of your heart are producing the spike, your immune system is going to attack your cardiac cells and cause damage.",nj5f7v,2021-05-23 17:11:25

No, it's not needed, because the mRNA falls apart/denatures within a couple hours (maybe a day?  Not 100% sure) and then no more spike proteins get made.

Ivermectin is on the WHO‚Äôs list of essential drugs, and is used as an anti-malarial, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic drug and   after years and years of research it is concluded to be 100% safe in humans and many animals. Veterinarians carry it and can you can find information on how to dose it properly. 

The reason why you aren‚Äôt supposed to believe that there are cheap and effective alternatives to the covid jab is because it would seriously ruin profits for the manufacturers and their investors, who have cornered a global monopoly so large that the expectation is that the whole world should buy their product 2, 3, or 4 times over. All this based on fear flamed by that immensely misleading covid death count, which the CDC quietly admitted that when they broadcast that 600,000 people have died, that 6% of those people died due to covid, while the rest died of terminal cancer, diabetes complications, suicide, heart disease, but had covid in their system.

Of those 6% an overwhelming majority of ppl had comorbidities, like obesity, diabetes, were over the age of 75...in other words they were not anyone‚Äôs definition of healthy.

So 6% of 600,000 is 36,000. About 30,000-50,000 ppl die of the flu every year. The number of documented Flu cases in 2020 dropped so significantly over 2019, 2018, 2017...any year you take...that covid precautions seemed to positively decimate the spread of one virus while having no attributable direct influence on another.

4. we dont know how long the mrna instructions will stay remembered in our body, or if they will work for mutated versions of the virus. therefore a booster may be necessary if the body begins to ""forget"" after the 2nd shot, or if theres a mutation

2. Temperature up about 0.5 degrees C
3. Headache
4. Muscle aches
5. Joint pain
6. Extreme lethargy. 

Very unpleasant, far worse than my annual flu shot.

I'm glad that you're feeling well now. Thank you for the detailed response and for the good wishes too.",njjn3p,2021-05-24 06:14:56
"Day 2 for me, it was about the size of a quarter and was brown. Now it's still the same colour but faded. And yeah bruises can take weeks sometimes so don't worry lol.

Yes I will be receiving my second dose and no problem.",njjn3p,2021-05-24 06:18:31
"Interesting. Mine's the size of a quarter as well and it's still the size of a quarter right now. I can't tell if it's faded. It's actually a darker color now than it was on Day 2.

We're having such a similar bruising experience! With the unexplained bruise on the knee, quarter size, and discovery on Day 2.

"Hey, just checking in. Is your bruise still visible today? Mine's still there. I heard it's about 3 weeks average for a bruise to go away completely. It'd be nice if the bruise was completely gone when I get my 2nd Pfizer dose.

You got your bruise a day before I got mine, so we're sort of on the same timeline. So I just wanted to check in.",njjn3p,2021-05-29 06:06:18

"Oh my, I really hope that the pain on your chest resolves. Yes, please keep me updated.

Nice to hear that your knee bruise is gone though.

My period arrived like clockwork as it always does.

"I think you are misinterpreting the first tweet, if you go to this doctor's main twitter page you can better contextualize his statements. He is not claiming that 15 cases of VITT happened without thrombocytopenia, rather he is sceptical whether VITT does in fact occur after 2nd dose at all. Remember VITT means vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, i.e. in order for a thrombotic event to be classified as an instance of VITT  it needs to be concurrent with thrombocytopenia. So what he is saying is that there is not data that shows that those cases after 2nd shot had thrombocytopenia and hence he is sceptical whether those really are instances of VITT. He is alluding to the possibility that perhaps VITT does not occur after 2nd dose at all. In one of his tweets he writes that if our prevalence estimates for VITT are correct we should already have many times more cases of VITT after the 2nd shot than we actually have. This together with the fact that in his opinion there has not been a convincing case of VITT makes him question whether VITT occurs after 2nd shot at all.

Tl;dr: the doctor is sceptical whether VITT occurs after 2nd shot.",njkp9g,2021-05-30 15:26:55

"So the common theory on why tinnitus happens after the shot is nerve inflammation. There have been several posts on here claiming their doctors have said such things can take upwards of 12 weeks to recover, perhaps more or less depending on the person. My dad had increased tinnitus after the second dose but it subsided within hours, so it's truly random how long it lasts. 

 I would say it is most likely not permanent, and only last until the nerve inflammation has gone down. I have seen some people have success after steroid treatment from their doctor, you may want to look into that.

I just wanted to get other opinions, and i'm going to see another ENT tuesday to get a second opinion. The first one clearly ruled out nerve dmg because my hearing was good, but who knows.
I have to say mine has gotten a bit better in the 2 weeks i've had it, it's at night it's the worst and i kinda miss hearing silence. It still spikes now and then during the day, but it's at night time when i hear it fully and it's kind of killing me slowly :) .",nj700o,2021-05-23 16:44:48

A 10 is often described as a pain so intense that you lose consciousness from the pain itself, and something most people will never experience and live to tell about.

It targets a protein called CD20 that some B cells carry. I think it kills them right away and then slowly over 6 months you build them back..And then at the 6 month mark you get another infusion to kill the new ones off. 
It‚Äôs confusing, I‚Äôm only partially sure I fully understand it. Every time I think I understand it I find new info. 

I don‚Äôt mind, the med is called ocrevus.",njn1g2,2021-05-24 03:18:19
"I'm very familiar with it.  It's antibody-based.  So, with antibody-based therapeutics, they hang around in the body for around a month.  To have an optimal B cell response, technically, you'd need to wait even longer than 12 weeks.  ~6 months from infusion would probably be more optimal and even then, based on data from rituximab (which also eliminates CD20+ B cells...same method...antibody-based, elimination by macrophages, etc), you'd still be 50/50 as to whether or not you seroconvert.  Rituximab is generally given in higher doses than ocrevus (as it's used to eliminate B cell lymphoma and all CD20+ B cells basically need to be eliminated to kill off the cancer) so you'll still probably have CD20+ B cells around which is why they probably recommend 12 weeks for it.  

Your neurologist may be thinking along the lines of T cell immunity as kind of a replacement for B cells in fighting off severe disease.  Without checking for T cells against spike protein, you don't know if you have them (and CD8 T cells go quite rapidly).  So, you may be in for several series of shots here.  One for T cells now, one for B cells later, but that 6 month infusion is going to kind of screw things up for them.",njn1g2,2021-05-24 03:41:28
"Thank you! 
I don‚Äôt know the reason that anyone‚Äôs recommending 12 weeks, it‚Äôs just what I‚Äôm seeing people say on ocrevus Facebook groups.

The CDC said the cases typically occurred within four days after receiving mRNA vaccines. It did not specify which vaccines. The US has given emergency authorisation to two mRNA vaccines, from Moderna Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech.

Israel‚Äôs health ministry in April said it was examining a small number of cases of heart inflammation in people who had received Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine, though it had not yet drawn any conclusions. Most of the cases in Israel were reported among people up to age 30.

Pfizer at the time said it had not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be the case in the general population and that a causal link to the vaccine had not been established.

The general public deserves better than vaccines that are still in phase 4 trials, and in a couple of years, there will be much of effective cures to Covid than these first wave of rushed vaccines.

>Also, you seem to be grossly misinformed about the whole situation. All of these vaccines were approved in non-conventional ways because we're kinda dealing with a global pandemic. Unreported side effects appearing when the number of patients go from dozens of thousands to hundreds of millions is absolutely expected.

I'm very much aware of what the purpose of the EUA was and how it's important to get large quantities of data on the vaccine rather sooner than later to study it's impacts and viability of large scale use. However, the early clinical trials included tens of thousands of individuals, and if the administrators of the clinical trial are too incompetent to realize that it impacts the cycles of double digit % of women, the entire clinical trial must have missed way less obvious symptoms. How difficult is it for a trial to keep track of the cycles of women and report it accurately? It's very objective and easily accessible data. Individuals who give their consent to a vaccine post clinical trial phase, should be informed about impacts this big. If you can find out that these kinds of side effects happen in clinical trials, someone should seriously get fired.

I'm actually quite well informed when it comes to how all the pieces come together. I have a Bachelors in Engineering, understand the method of how mRNA vaccines trick the cells into creating the spike proteins, understand the benefits of herd immunity, and all the other usual information that a well informed individual like yourself is aware of. However, just because the conclusions that I come to when it comes to applying my understanding of the situation are different from your conclusions, doesn't mean that I'm grossly misinformed. 

In the past, the fastest approval process for a vaccine was for ebola and it took 5 years to approve it. Generally speaking, vaccines take over a decade to approve. I understand the sense of urgency when it comes to vaccinations in middle of a pandemic, but right now, we are giving highly experimental vaccines in terms of how long it usually takes to approve them, to children! Children who have 99.997%  or higher chance of making it IF they get Covid. Right now in USA, there are less than 300 deaths in the 0-17 age group. Want a source for this?

And we are doing a mass vaccination campaign on that age group with a vaccine that is well suited for older at high risk population. It seems like insanity to me. Especially with children likely experiencing more severe reactions to the vaccine. I doubt you are able to see the both sides of this very not black and white issue. I can, and I'm not pretending that I know all the answers. These are my observations, my opinions, and I don't present these as facts. We need a dialogue and more careful examination of the side effects of the vaccine. I know people like you just like to pretend that the risks are virtually zero, but if you scroll through this sub, people's quality of life has been impacted way more by the vaccine, than it would have been if they didn't get it. And yes, this is not the experience of a majority of people who get the vaccine, but you shouldn't just pretend that its perfectly safe, or the choice is stupid simple when ""Covid symptoms are worse than the vaccine.""

In these leaflets, the side effects found in testing and after the drug being released are listed. There are very few drugs that don't list ""death"" in their side effects.    
Ibuprofen (Advil) lists heart attacks and strokes as rare side effects.     
Paracetamol (Tylenol) is extremely toxic. It's safe to use in prescription doses, but going above it kills your liver really, really fast. The maximum dosage for an adult is 4g/day, taking this for two weeks already damages the liver; a single dose of 10g is enough to cause liver failure.

They went gangbusters right of the gate.  They progressed to phase 3 very quickly, while earlier phases had showed interim data but weren't done yet.  Heck, human and animal testing started at the same time.  As I said, they parallelized everything.

Recently saw a neurologist, who blamed it on migraines (which I've never had before getting the shot). He put me on nortriptyline, which helps some with pain, but I can still feel the pressure. Having really bad spasms too, and having to take Clonazepam just to sleep. Honestly, I don't think it's migraines, but no one seems to know what's going on. Can't work, can't drive, this continues to be a nightmare for me.

"I dealt with stomach and intestinal ‚Äúchanges‚Äù for about 7 weeks after my 2nd Pfizer dose. My stomach seems more ‚Äútouchy‚Äù with certain foods and my bowel movements changed dramatically - more frequent, very crampy with nausea, aand intense and with a big change with gas  being passed too. I started to take pro-biotics, which helped immensely. I hope you all feel better and please keep posting to provide updates on how you are doing.

My own theory after trying to become educated on the vaccine:  the vaccine stimulates certain receptors that are found in large numbers in both our respiratory tract and gut. Could the side effects we are experiencing be linked to the gut receptors being overtly stimulated and throwing us off balance? I would love to see more research done on how the vaccine actually works within our body, and why there is such a wide range of side effects.

I just went to the grocery store and I got some chicken and tuna fish.  I tried making some fish the other night and it was not appealing like it usually is.

One thing to keep in mind is that, at some point, there will be more vaccines to choose from as there are tons of COVID vaccines being created.

By early May my creatinine more than doubled and filtration rate went down, to stage 3 kidney failure. Blood pressure had been 125/x went to 165/x also in May. CRP (reactive protein) doubled, sedimentation rate suggests blood thickening (read clotting). So the vaccine caused inflammation, hypertension,  possible clotting and kidney failure. This along with the other side effects noted by others here.  There's not much for therapy other than a hypertension drug and hope that inflammation declines so the kidneys can recover.

I feel very lucky since with the first vax I got an immune system ‚Äúreset‚Äù that resolved an issue that had doctors stumped for 8 years. Super beneficial for me personally.

I would follow your doctor‚Äôs guidance and if you can stay isolated read the research papers that are coming out each week on long-hauler response to each type of vaccination.

They might. I think you can leave the phone number blank though. More likely they'll get a copy of your medical records.

> Will I potentially get accused of lying? 

There's a legal warning about fraud, but that's if someone were creating false reports using invented or stolen identities. Stuff like that.

The purpose of the CDC and FDA is to protect people from infectious diseases and from drug mistakes. It's okay to talk about your symptoms.

VAERS doesn't care about that, it just collects symptoms. You're a patient, it's not your responsibility to figure out *why* you're experiencing your symptoms.

Several countries in Europe already accept Sputnik V (e.g. Cyprus) and some don't require anything at all (e.g. Greece).

If EMA ruling on Sputnik is positive, then there would be no need for another vaccine.

If it's negative, it's likely it would be safer to get another vaccine by that time and more data on mixing vaccines.

I'll get teary and/or filled with rage at the drop of a hat, and then a few hours later will be totally fine.

"Yes, and it seemed to trigger what I can only explain as a Laryngospasm episode. It was scary, couldn't breathe for like 7 seconds.

Both of our arms hurt for 2 days and for me it was hard to lift my arm above my shoulder. We also felt super tired, my BF said like he did not feel like doing anything, while my tiredness just felt like a period tiredness. But literally after two days it was back to normal.

Apparently we're supposed to swing our arm slowly after the jab, which we clearly did not do lol

"I've got my first Pfizer jab last week and it was a very positive experience. Only sore arm and being really tired for 2 days.

I hope you'll be fine, pay attention to your own condition and contact doctors immediately if you are suspicious about something.

My experience (as also has been mentioned in this sub several times) is the jab caused a temporary low blood pressure. That said in my case I always have this low blood pressure, I had fainted so many times due to low blood pressure and humidity. Eating/drinking sweet stuffs slowly while getting some airs after the jab definitely helped, in my case.

I can't say much about PMDD because I'm on the pill anyway, but as someone who always has a crazy PMDD due to stress, as long as it is temporary (as it is for this COVID vaccine case), then it is usually not a big issue (I talked to different gynecologists in different countries and have been told the same thing).",nirxzo,2021-05-22 23:36:45

"Just have gatorade or something with electrolytes available to make sure you stay hydrated.

You can take ibuprofen after the shot, but generally recommend not taking ibuprofen before the shot.

Most people have mild symptoms, so I would read the CDC information on what to expect for the range of common side effects.

Just a note for the mass vax sites, on the two occasions I went they had ambulances and medics on stand by while people did their 15 or 30 minute wait, so you could flag them to come over easily if you thought you were having a reaction.",nirxzo,2021-05-23 03:08:15
"Yes, Im a hypochondriac and if I could go back in time and tell myself to not read this forum before getting the shots I would lol. The anxiety beforehand was way worse than the side effects themselves. A good rule of thumb on Reddit is to remember doom posts make the front pages, good experiences get stuck in New and hardly get traction. This is also in part because there are antivax subreddits that crosspost very rare adverse effects from here to there, causing troll brigades and much more upvotes to the bad side effects.",nirxzo,2021-05-22 22:17:30

I am about to start my 2nd period since the first dose & it's looking like it's going to be rough too. That said, from my understanding, it's only bad for a few months. Still worth getting the vaccine. COVID is much worse than the period side effects imo.",niw8z7,2021-05-23 02:01:18

"Hi my lovey, I suffer from the exact same thing. I have major hormonal imbalances that have effected my quality of life, and I'm choosing to wait out this vaccine. Do not let anybody force you, or guilt you into getting this. A lot of women have suffered hormonal side effects and I don't want to risk that for myself, and the longer we wait, the more data will come out. This vaccine isn't approved and they are experimenting on our bodies. There are so many government official websites that prove this, and this vaccine could alter our bodies forever. I'd say, wait it out... see what more data they collect on women, and our bodies, and how this jab effects us.... if you've spent so much time waiting for your hormones to go back to normal, I wouldn't risk it.",niw8z7,2021-05-24 00:20:04
"Here is something I had heard before but I wish I had been reminded of before I was vaccinated: it wasn‚Äôt tested on us.  

It was tested on men.  It was tested on women unable to conceive either due to age, medical history, or on certain forms of birth control.  

The medical community were surprised by the period effects.  They don‚Äôt know why it is happening only that it is.  At first doctors denied it was even happening. The same people in these threads saying it‚Äôs fine everyone says it will come back and everything is normal were telling women a month ago that their period symptoms were unrelated to the vaccine.  

I don‚Äôt have an answer for you.  I have to travel for my work and enter hospitals regularly so I felt I needed to.  But if I‚Äôd known that I‚Äôd be three months without a period and a doctor flippantly telling me on a telehealth visit that it ‚Äúsounds like menopause‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt believe it could be vaccine related when I know it is, then I probably would have waited.",niw8z7,2021-05-24 15:57:33

These vaccines are still in the trial period.  They have not been fully approved by FDA as safe they just are allowing emergency use.",niw8z7,2021-05-24 18:09:48
"I am so, so sad that I got the vaccine without waiting it out for more research. I got the AstraZeneca vaccine back in March.

Now I‚Äôm dealing with extreme cycle related moodswings, anxiety, extreme heavy bleeding, and a ton of other unexplained issues that actually look a lot like long haul COVID symptoms since getting the vaccine. I am still struggling three months later, even though it seems to be getting better slowly. The last few months were honestly the worst of my life.. My doctor has been incredibly dismissive about my problems and claims it had nothing to do with the vaccine. Just know that when you do get ‚Äústrange‚Äù side effects,  you are on your own because they don‚Äôt take it seriously at all.",niw8z7,2021-05-27 19:06:06
"Late, early, or missed periods are super common. Good news is they go back to normal within a month or two. I haven‚Äôt heard of the vaccine impacting any other hormonal cycles except maybe a few people here have said they had insomnia for up to a week after. Idk if that would be hormonal though.

>1. I've already gotten COVID. It was awful for like 2-3 days but I'm better, and haven't gotten sick since. What would the vaccine do for me that natural immunity doesn't?

The strength of natural immunity seems to depend on how severe your infection was.

Covid kicked my butt back and forth for over a week, I'm still going through with vaccination.

>2. In theory, wouldn't I be getting continually exposed, and if so, why would my immunity diminish?

Honestly, it's all guesswork at this time. But it seems likely that Covid will settle into a pattern of waves or seasonal illness, like other coronaviruses.

So you're actually not being continuously exposed. That's especially true because new variants are mutating and emerging.

>3. Why are there no traditional ""dead virus"" vaccines like Polio or Hep A? Alternatively, if there are, what are they, and are they available in the US?

There are. They're not available in the US though.

Inactivated vaccines contain the actual virus particles but the genetic material inside them has been destroyed. 

This means they expose the immune system to much less of the spike protein and other antigens. That's not effective enough, so there are other irritating ingredients to jump-start the immune response.

This technology is known for being less effective - one of the reasons why there hasn't been a cold vaccine before is that existing technologies don't work very well against coronaviruses.

Nobody has started the FDA approval process, thus there are no vaccines of this type in the US.",nikt1y,2021-05-22 20:37:13

"Fwiw, the mRNA is completely eliminated by your body within a few days, so the odds of directly related side effects showing up years from now are pretty low, if any at all. Most of the side effects we have seen are the vaccine triggering your immune system and causing inflammation or enhancing existing inflammation (and almost always within first days or up to 6 weeks from injection- and the majority resolving within a few days.) In my case, I received Moderna and shot #2 caused a tender arm and 3 days later painful stomach cramping and GI tract inflammation... and the works LOL. Not the most fun, but covid probably would‚Äôve been much worse for me. I already have existing GI tract inflammation so the vax just sent my immune system on a witch hunt down there üòÇ

The menstrual system is especially sensitive to any changes or stressors on your body, so minor disruptions aren‚Äôt exactly surprising, especially coupled with the amounts of anxiety and stress people have experienced related to the vaccines/covid/pandemic. They‚Äôve found with the flu vaccines in past studies that women have more robust reactions than men with smaller doses. (Unfortunately)the initial studies for most of the covid vaccines were most focused on efficiency and efficacy rather than looking at how the effects differ on biological lines... which is probably why there wasn‚Äôt large reporting of menstrual disruptions in the trials. IMO that lack of data is more of a reflection on the overall historical bias of clinical trials not paying attention to the health of women paired with a need for extreme speed due to the pandemic rather than some conspiracy to screw people over. I am glad to hear that there are more focused vaccine studies on menstrual reactions, breast feeding, pregnancy, and conceiving post-Vax now! And if you did experience menstrual disruptions, I encourage you to contribute to one of those studies (I know there was one pinned to this subreddit not too long ago!) 

I do think as risk of covid community spread collectively drops and these more focused studies release their findings, we may begin to see vaccine recommendations shift and become more personalized to the individual based on sex/health history/age/etc rather than ‚Äútake what‚Äôs first available‚Äù. ACIP actually almost considered recommending that women under 40/50 consider receiving an mRNA Vax over J&J but decided that actually carried a MUCH higher risk of damaging the public trust of an otherwise effective public health tool to end the pandemic. Their risk assessment is a pretty good read to get insight to how they come to these decisions!

Masks aren't 100%.  But, they are still very good at filtering out viruses.  You'd need continuous exposure to a minimal infectious dose.  It's unlikely that you're going to get that as more and more of the population becomes vaccinated.

>How then, are ""standard"" vaccines different from the ones offered by Pfizer and Moderna?

They aren't that much different.  Instead of using a live virus to deliver RNA, they use a lipid.  The live viruses themselves also have a lipid that contains the RNA.  The live viruses replicate within the body.  The modern mRNA vaccines don't.  The live viruses contain numerous coding mRNAs.  The modern mRNA vaccines contain an mRNA coding for a single protein.",nikt1y,2021-05-22 17:28:43
"Try to understand what is being said.  Measles, mumps, nasal influenza, and oral polio vaccines are all live RNA virus vaccines.  They deliver RNA into the cells where the cell produces those proteins coded for by the mRNA.  They all contain a lipid layer.  

That is not much different from what's happening with the mRNA vaccines being used right now.  It's a lipid with mRNA inside of it, that fuses with the cell, mRNA is then translated into a protein, and a subsequent immune response occurs.  The vaccines do the exact same thing...",nikt1y,2021-05-22 17:38:32

"> So Dr. Fauci himself has stated publicly to the world that we do not know what any long term effects may arise from these vaccines, yet you know? 

That's not what he said at all.  You should actually read his comments rather than the anti-vaxxer propaganda.  He specifically stated:

""The second thing is that people say, 'But what about long-term effects?'  If you look at the history of vaccinology, and you find out when the so-called 'long-term' which means one that isn't just 24 to 72 hours following the vaccination, the overwhelming majority, more than 90%, occur between 30 and 45 days following the dose, and that is the reason why baked into the approval process of an EUA that the FDA does not grant an EUA until 60 days have gone by from the time that one half of the people in the trial have gotten their last dose so before you even get to an EUA you have to go well beyond where almost all of the so-called long-term effects occur.  So, although in biology, and I don't need to tell this audience that, you can never 100% say something is safe, **but it would be extraordinarily unusual if you see any unanticipated long-term effects.**""

https://youtu.be/LnXi8xD4Z9Q?t=1864

>Any Google search from 10s of different sources will state we do not know what long term effects may arise but it is better than getting covid (simplified speech)

Again, vaccines aren't voodoo.  

>So why has there been almost 4000 deaths reported after the Covid vaccines in a 4 month span as opposed to 219 in 2019 from the flu vaccine?

Have you actually looked at all of those deaths?  Because we've been monitoring them for months now and can safely separate anti-vaxxers posting random deaths to VAERS by tracking vaccine lot numbers and place and time the vaccine was given (among other methods that I won't get into).  It's a heck of a lot less than 4000.  

>There is a reason these vaccines have only been approved for emergency use.

"Fear sells what?

What incentive might people have for voicing concerns and reporting their own anecdotal experiences from taking the vaccine? Or doctors and scientists who have their own hasitency towards these vaccines, but are being silenced because apparently mainstream science is non-refutable. 

Fear does sell, but mostly vaccines due to the media hyping up covid and making people fear even the thought of going outside regardless of age or pre-existing conditions.",nidq4k,2021-05-22 15:32:27
"I had no after effects after vaccination. While my sister, similar to your manager did have flu like symptoms for 2 days. My personal experience can be like 50% of developing effects after vaccination. But science has strength in numbers. We do testing in 1000s of people to figure out how likely you can have an effect in the whole population. Again the question comes down to - how do you believe what you hear or see. Remain with evidence of your personal experience or use logic.",nidq4k,2021-05-22 12:22:41

Say your office has 4000 or 40000 people. Do you expect to see all not having covid? In case some so get covid in your larger office, how do you explain that? You measure the number of people who got covid and divide by number of them who didn't get. That's your prevalence rate. And that is statistic, part of science. You can teach anyone to follow logic and come under same conclusion. That's how science works my dear.",nidq4k,2021-05-22 12:02:46

My partner and his siblings,plus our friends/coworkers all got Pfizer. 1 of my friends got moderna, and a few older relatives got moderna. Here are our experiences:

1. My grandmom: 86/F, second moderna on 5/12, had chills the next day. Is fine now 
2. My aunt: 57/F moderna, unknown when but had flu like side effects from second dose, fine now.
3. Friend 1: 31/F Pfizer, had second shot around a month ago, tired and sore arm for a day
4. Friend 2: 30/M Moderna: second shot 5/14 and had flu side effects (fever, body aches, chills, but no GI upset) for about 18 hours post shot. Side effects kicked in around 24 hrs later. He's fine now
5. Partner's sisters 26/F and 35/F, both Pfizer. Got their second doses last week. Just had arm soreness.
6. My partner had his second dose of Pfizer 4/24. He's 32/M. No side effects first dose, and slight arm pain and some brain fog for a day with the second.
7. Myself: 31/F Pfizer...second dose 5/15. I have emetophobia and health anxiety so I was very scared for both. I had 1 hour of slight upset stomach the morning after dose #1 but I think it was nerves and gatorade that caused it. My IBS is worse though. 
Second dose I was very nervous. I don't like feeling sick or nauseous. I got tylenol, gatorade, soups, plus anti nausea meds from my doctor. I had to use none of them. The only side effect I noticed with my second was a slightly sore arm and my workouts cause more pain. No fever, no nausea, no chills. I cleaned the house and ran errands

Overall myself and my relatives/friends all had decent experiences with the worst just being flu like symptoms for 1 day (not even) and most having no side effects other than typical arm soreness.

"This is a good point in regards to the second dose. Most around me that have had the 2nd shot, stated making sure one is hydrated well and often really did make a difference in side effects, if any afterwards. Even the pharmacist who did my first injection told me to make sure to stay super hydrated. I have MS, so of course I have been told that side effects are really unknown, and have not really been tested for those of us with MS, but I have been thru hell and back with it, so I think I should be able to tolerate some side effects from a second dose if thats what is in the cards for me.",nhwr99,2021-05-22 01:28:38

I am also the only person on my team that has not been vaccinated and it's an uncomfortable feeling, especially when people ask about it. I have somewhat personal/controversial reasons for not getting it (trying to conceive) but I obviously don't want to share that or invite a discussion about it with my teammates. I'm not at the point where I'm comfortable getting this vaccine (also not anti-vax) and I'm not sure I ever will be. Do not get this vaccine unless you would 100% get it no matter what other people are doing.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 02:50:06
To thine own self be true. Maybe your sixth sense is trying to tell you something. I'm not taking it because I don't want to and I almost died from the MMR when I was a kid.

"Yes, absolutely! Just when it was announced that vaccines were available - there wasn't any shaming yet of people who haven't had it, I had a very strong intuitive sense that these vaccines were not for me.  I've had reactions to many medical interventions that other people were fine with, one resulting in a severe lung infection that led to monthly visits to the emergency room because I wouldn't breathe, so I am extremely cautious about taking anything that could cause any type of side effect.  So, I was totally fine with my decision, figured I'd just have to keep wearing masks and being careful.  Then slowly in the media people who haven't been vaccinated are being called ""selfish"" and people who have been vaxed are being told to avoid non-vaxxers.  Friends of mine, without knowing that I hadn't been vaccinated, started really bad mouthing non-vaxxers.  It never, ever occured to me that anyone would want to have a say about what I do with my body!  I know people will say that I could infect others.  Well, the reality is that I work from home, wear a mask every single time I go out, and I've only been out to shop and to have socially distanced lunches with friends at parks.  I am being very, very, very careful.  It has made me really sad to be painted as being selfish and stupid.  To me, the propoganda about the vaccines, the fact that no negative news about it can be reported, are the main things that make me suspicious of it!  The fact that no one is acknowledging that it is impossible that one new medical intervention is going to be safe for 100% of the people on the planet, is what is so scary to me.  It's all smoke and mirrors. All that said, everyone I know who has had the vaccine has been 100% fine.  No one in my world has had a bad reaction.  So, you'd think I'd feel safe getting it, but I don't.  I have to listen to my instincts.  My instincts have saved my life in the past so I trust them. I support anyone else 100% in getting the vaccine if that is what their instincts tell them to do.  When I had the lung infection which resulted from a ""new"" drug that I took, I had to drive myself to the emergency room several times in the middle of the night because I couldn't breathe.  It was terrifying.  It is the memory of that that is why I listen to my instincts.

Will happily continue to wear my mask. I'd rather ""start the clock"" on the protection you get from the vaccine when I feel like I don't still have natural immunity in play. But I feel like some just refuse to accept anyone not getting it ASAP. I just think there is more individuality that comes in to play than a blanket request for everyone to get the shot ASAP and I don't think people should be judged or pressured if they're taking a second to evaluate their own circumstances.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 00:44:27

My gut is screaming no about the vaccine.. let me see what happens over the next 6 months - a year and *maybe* I'll consider it.

I mean, they can't say something like if you had COVID, you may be fine waiting because I'm sure immune responses vary among individuals and if they did something like had an antibody test or similar as first step, there are logistics and massive costs that come along with that. I get it's easiest to just say everyone do X even if it may not make the most sense for everyone to do X.

"It's easy to search how ""good"" the vaccine is with all the media focusing that everyone should get it. 

The problem lies in how the research or the trials went through to claim such efficacies on the vaccine. 

If I were to search for a reason not to get the vaccine, I would've made up my mind and not post such statement as stated above. I would've shrugged off the feeling and just decided not to get the vaccine and continue to claim that vaccine is not safe.

But the fact that I am concerned and I want to know the truth to be able to protect my parents from such virus is already proof that I'm not an anti-vaxxer.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 11:52:08

"There are classical vaccine type (non-mRNA) options. Depending on your country, Astra Zeneca and Janssen might be good options for you, and the latter is a one-dose.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 13:18:49
"I wanted to chime in on some things you said here

1. There is no interaction with your DNA.
2. The protein created is similar to a protein found in COVID, so your statement that ‚Äúunlike classic vaccines‚Ä¶ your body doesn‚Äôt gain any recognition of COVID‚Äù is misleading. It‚Äôs true that the immune system doesn‚Äôt get the whole blueprint of the virus, but having partial informations seems sufficient.
3. You mention variants emerging in the replication. However this is not a single event that only happens upon infection. Without immunity the virus will replicate millions or even billions of time in your body. Mutations happen frequently but most of them are not viable. The more time you allow the virus to replicate in your body though, the higher the chance is that a viable mutation will appear. If you are vaccinated, your immune system will shut down the virus quickly so that fewer replications will happen, decreasing the probability that you will be the host of a new variant.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 13:48:39
"I think everyone should research so they are comfortable as possible, but to add:

We've been injecting people with mRNA vaccines for over a decade. I realize not on this scale, but there's been several clinical human trials with them. They were aware of the theoretical possibility of autoimmune conditions developing in some people, which is why the mRNA COVID vaccines are modified (modified mRNA has been used for 5+years now).

I know how variants are formed lol. There is increasing evidence (several studies tbh) that the vaccine curbs transmission.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 16:26:35
"Your data is outdated. The COVID vaccines also reduce transmissibility, no matter what study you look at. Just like wearing a mask, it is your moral duty to do everything in your power to make sure you do not transmit a deadly virus to another individual. Not a legal responsibility!!

"Sorry to hear about all of the issues you experienced, that must be frustrating beyond belief because you never really knew what you signed up for and now you are the one who needs to cope with your symptoms that have a significant impact on your life.

Do you think that you having covid and taking vanco which happens to be one of the strongest antibiotics available played any kind of factor? Reason why I ask is because my wife was on vanco for almost 6 months when she had c-diff and while FMT cured it years ago, would ones immune system being nuked by vanco play any kind of factor?",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 17:58:21
"No one is saying doctors are useless‚Äîthey clearly do amazing things. But, in regards to the vaccine, they do not have some hidden information that is not widely available to the public.

Like I said, all the info health care providers will give you trickles down from the CDC.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 16:30:45
"How is people having discernment and looking out for their own health an ‚Äúagenda‚Äù compared to the actual marketing & propaganda that‚Äôs promoting a Big Pharma injection? There is media suppression of ideas that counter the dominant narrative, so of course people are looking for anecdotal advice from people online who are likely more trustworthy than a media outlet that gets its funding from
Big Pharma.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 14:55:50
"I don't have much faith in JJ as a company, and while the method that it works is more traditional and proven, in this specific vaccine we still lack the long term safety data. As a healthy male in my late 20s, I fail to see how Covid is a serious concern for my health.

I get the herd immunity part, after all, I'm fully vaccinated with everything else and even got the HPV vaccine a year ago because o didn't receive it as a teenager. However, I don't feel like I have a moral obligation to help with the herd immunity on still experimental vaccines when there could be mild to severe side effects that we aren't aware because lack of long term data.

Thanks for the response and I'm glad that you made the right choice for you by being vaccinated. I just ordered a 150 pack of KN95 masks to wear at work instead of traditional cloth masks to do my part of being as safe as possible while following my intuition about the vaccine.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 17:17:42
"We have not been injecting people with mRNA vaccines for over a decade, that is completely false. The first human trial of an mRNA was done 2013 to 2016 and the results were questionable at best. The main finding in that human trial was that needle injections of the drug were 100% uneffective versus skin/topical/needle-free applications which did see some positive titers and antibody success. But don't take my word for it, read the study for yourself. [First human mRNA vax trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28754494/)

""Interpretation: This first-ever demonstration in human beings shows that a prophylactic mRNA-based candidate vaccine can induce boostable functional antibodies against a viral antigen when administered with a needle-free device, although not when injected by a needle-syringe. The vaccine was generally safe with a reasonable tolerability profile.""",ni4wpt,2021-05-24 00:22:58

Granted, there are studies going on right now that are more focused on the transmitting aspect such as the one covered in [this article](https://www.livescience.com/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-college-trial-transmission.html). I think more data will continue to come out here that I'm super interested to see. Nothing that is shown so far puts the vaccine on any different level than natural immunity in the transmission area (meaning it just speaks more to a reduced likelihood of being infected/re-infected, and thus less likely to spread.)",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 13:00:50
"Fair enough. I don't think I've ever heard of a vaccine side effect that emerged after more than two weeks, though - and there have been a lot of vaccines on the more classical platform.

The other issue, as I understand it, is that every side effect found for a Covid vaccine (except for the sore arm side effect) is far more common in people who catch the disease than in people who get the vaccine. At this point the benefit to society at large for you to get vaccinated is somewhere between secondary and dubious. The primary benefit, at present, is obviously to the person who gets the vaccine.

KN95 masks are a good choice. I've had those and KF94s. Either should keep you safe, so long as you're careful about not sharing air with others for long periods. Best wishes.",ni4wpt,2021-05-22 23:19:43

25m from Berlin. I was in the same situation and decided to take it 10 days ago. I was freaked out too about the blood clots issue but I wanted to get immunity as soon as possible so that I can protect myself and people around me. I watched lots and lots of videos to understand the risks and decided that it's better for me. The most valuable source for me that I can share was this [document from EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-benefits-risks-context). If you are still not convinced and don't feel safe, you might consider waiting for an mRNA vaccine, it seems like they will be available quite soon in Germany especially if you speak German and have a hausartz.
It will take around 12 weeks to get fully vaccinated with AZ. It's likely that you'll be able to get both mRNA shots in around 12 weeks in Germany.

"Two weeks to the day after my first Pfizer shot I woke up with extreme vertigo, loss of balance etc. I was out camping and it was terrifying. Packed up camp and my boyfriend drove me to the ER. They thought I might have had a stroke because Meclizine didn‚Äôt work. MRI/MRA ruled that out and they thought it was BPPV but Eppley maneuvers didn‚Äôt help. The next day I wake up with a sore throat and start getting sick. It turns into a bad head cold and then chest cold, and after about a week the vertigo subsided, but I was sick for about two weeks. I think it was the infection affecting my inner ear first, rather than with the other symptoms. I don‚Äôt think it was related to my vaccine, so I went ahead and got my second one. There are a lot of things that can cause issues with your balance, and a LOT of them have to do with inner ear stuff. It is probably unrelated to the vaccine and will likely get better with time. Mine was horrible for many days before slowly improving. Best of luck, please keep seeing a doctor about it if it doesn‚Äôt get better.

EDIT: I looked at some of your post history. With my vertigo I was only nauseous with a lot of movement. I could watch TV and do schoolwork on my computer just fine.

It takes a few hours for the Tylenol to work, which makes no sense since it‚Äôs half life is so short.

She had more severe symptoms like you, mine was bad but not as bad.

First shot I broke out in a sweat and felt light headed right after but that went away within 20 minutes. Next two days arm was really sore and I felt really fatigued achy and just off. One week after the shot had really bad chills for about 30 minutes. Didn‚Äôt feel normal until about 10 days after. Never had covid knowingly,ni7ggq,2021-05-22 03:29:37

Calm down. Let people come to their own conclusions.,nhdvln,2021-05-21 12:41:10
"That‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs frustrating. We don‚Äôt know the long term effects of Covid or the vaccine. What we do know from studies is that people who had Covid are likely to develop some type of mental illness (1 in 3) with 6 months (I think it‚Äôs 6 months) of diagnosis. This type of vaccine was developed 8 years with a SARS outbreak but I understand your point in that it feels new.

It will take a generation or two to truly understand the impact of both. I‚Äôm really hoping there‚Äôs nothing similar like what happens when you get Chicken Pox and later can develop Shingles concerning Covid.

Personally I got the vaccine to protect my community and avoid the chance of dying a terrible death.",nhdvln,2021-05-21 22:32:47
"I have no idea why this is  being downvoted. This is pretty common knowledge, as I was even told this by my own OBGYN during my first ultrasound. It's also easily verifiable, so here's one of the many sources I plucked from a cursory google search:
  
>The incidence of a miscarriage in the first six weeks is as high as 31%.
The risk of a miscarriage decreases by 10% after the pregnancy crosses six weeks. Once the fetal heart activity is established after six weeks, there is a decreased chance of failed pregnancy.  
   
https://www.medicinenet.com/what_week_is_the_highest_risk_of_a_miscarriage/article.htm  
  
10% is hardly negligible, obviously, but it's still a significant decrease in risk.",nhdvln,2021-05-23 23:23:55

"First off if you trust Reddit more than your doctor then you will fare badly in diagnosing and understanding whatever condition you have. If one believes they have been misdiagnosed or feels misunderstood then that is why we have the options to search out several doctors for second or third opinions.

Yeah me too. It looks like it‚Äôs a vaccine that needs doctor guidance from start to finish. Also I read that if you have iron deficiency it hits you harder too.,nhutqn,2021-05-22 05:36:36

That's from a smallpox or BCG (TB) vaccine, that happens to virtually everyone who gets one of those. Virtually no one born in the US gets either of those vaccines, which is why (if you live here) you only see them on immigrants (literally).

This argument has been made for a variety of vaccines, since at least the 60s or 70s.

It resolved itself though? My worry is more because I have to fly out of country tomorrow and I‚Äôm not sure what my access to medical care is going to be. Wondering if I should see a doctor to make it less than 3 weeks lol,nhq5hb,2021-05-21 18:59:27
"Yes, it totally resolved on its own. I did see my dr, and she said she had seen it in other patients. Shooting pains in the breasts also, not sure if you‚Äôre female but I also had that but not for too long. I think the lymph nodes are one of the primary sites of your immune response so it is normal. I would see the dr if you are concerned, of course, but I bet it will go away on its own soon.",nhq5hb,2021-05-21 20:10:34
And also I don‚Äôt know anyone else who reacted so strongly to this vaccine as I did. Everyone else I know had either no side effects or a few days of side effects so I would bet yours will not last 3 weeks.

When you get it, rotate your arm the entire 15 minutes you are there and then drink a ton of electrolytes. My daughter is 19 and had it the same time I did and no reactions either. My son (23) had it before us and no reactions either. Go for it and don't let people scare you! People who post on here are usually the ones who have side effects but there are millions and millions that had zero reactions. Get it on a Friday and then binge on netflix to distract yourself.

It's normal to be nervous about any shot, but just remember that it's a safe, well-tested vaccine that can help prevent you from getting reinfected by one of these nasty variants going around.  I got an mRNA one, but I know a ton of women under 50 who got the J&J and were totally fine with hardly any side effects.

You're also helping protect others around you and getting us back to normalcy.  As a parent of kids who aren't yet eligible to get the vaccine, every person who gets a vaccine puts my mind at ease a little more since my kids will be benefitting from the herd immunity around them.

There's another effect at work too. For product experiences, it's been observed that people are multiples more likely to report a bad experience than a good one. I do not remember the amount, but it's quite significant. You hear much more about the bad experiences, which creates an impression that they are more common than they are.

The amount something is reported, is not a direct measure of how much it happens. To get a better statistical picture, you can make a random sampling, but social media is nearly the opposite of doing that.

"The soreness you felt is from the vaccine being in your muscle. That wouldn‚Äôt have happened if you had just been poked with the needle without any vaccine entering your body. 
The pressure required to get the vaccine liquid out of the syringe and into your body actually happens between the syringe plunger (the end that gets pushed on) and the barrel flange (the rim on the barrel that the injector holds in the crook of their index and middle finger, typically.) No pressure or pushing into your flesh is required to move the plunger down the barrel of the syringe, thanks to the flanges bearing all the force required to make the plunger plunge. 

Here‚Äôs a link showing the anatomy of a typical syringe in case a visual helps anyone understand what I said.

"I'm no doctor, but I can try to answer your questions. Bear in mind though, that side effects vary widely across different individuals. I'm just speaking from my experience.

The day after I got my first dose, I mentioned body aches and nausea. I also had severe fatigue (just slept the entire day, it was quite peaceful, actually). Your symptoms sound similar to mine, so I wouldn't worry about it. Though I do advise you keep an eye on your symptoms, if they start to get worse you'll want to get that checked out.

As for the severity of symptoms related to a past COVID case, I'm not sure. I had COVID back in November, which is obviously way prior to my first shot, so I can't compare the severity of the vaccine when it comes to having COVID in the past versus not.

It's completely okay to be anxious about your second shot. I myself have a thing with needles that causes me to have a panic attack after the shot, but it goes away within fifteen minutes. The way our minds work is that if you keep reading about having nausea and that becomes your expectation, you're more likely to experience that since your mind is expecting it. In my case, all I could think about was the needle up until I got the shot. Because of that, I had nausea immediately after both my shots (due to panic attacks, NOT the vaccine itself). After my first dose I experienced nausea the next day for maybe an hour but felt better after I ate. One thing I do advise, is to let the caregiver know beforehand that you might get nauseous. There's no shame in it, and they're there to make you as comfortable as you can be.

I have ADHD as well, and personally I've never read anything that correlates the vaccine to ADHD. I feel exactly the same now as I did before I was vaccinated. 

While it's good to have those extra electrolytes, get some rest! Your body will thank you for letting it rest while it gets used to the vaccine. 

Hope this helped a bit!",nhf7j3,2021-05-25 22:38:21

Personally, I didn't eat before I got my vaccine because I know myself enough to expect to get nauseous, and I'd rather dry heave than vomit. As for after your vaccine, like I stated in the first response, I recommend you take the day to rest. I didn't eat anything in particular, just when I was hungry.

Honestly I was kind of in the same boat. I was always really skiddish about the vaccines and then back in April one day I finally decided I wanted the J&J if I was gonna get one(the idea of scheduling 2 vaccines didn't excite me) and originally i had scheduled a J&J appointment the same morning it was suspended. That threw a wrench in things. Then for the next month I was working 2 jobs and never had any time. Well long story short my fully vaccinated (two doses) parents are visiting in a little over 2 weeks and that pushed me back to J&J again(I still didn't want 2 doses) but when I looked into it had the second dose the 3rd week when they are here so that cleared up some things) and I just decided yesterday to do it(the pharmacy at the store I work at said they were running low) so it just felt like something I had to do and get it over with it was a rough night but I am encouraged by the fact that I won't have to go back for another one,nhdh9m,2021-05-21 06:15:25
"The risk of getting the clotting disorder from the J&j vaccine is much less than the risk of dying in a car wreck this year.  The risk of a severe reaction to a vaccine is at least 1000 times less than dying from covid, and that doesn't include all of the long term effects from covid.  (Just try going to pubmed.gov and search for covid fertility or long term covid, etc for primary research sources.)  There have been no credible sources for vaccine effects on hormones, just people spreading fear.",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 22:15:28
"Because I'm a caregiver I got my vaccine pretty early on, first in early January and second in early February. I was pretty nervous especially because it was early but it wasn't too bad. My first period after was a little weird, I don't typically have much in terms of cramps but I got some mild ones came, also it came slightly later than usual but all the ones since have been normal for me.

But I absolutely cannot tell you how relieved I feel after. I feel much safer in public, I was able to hug my parents again for the first time in over a year without being afraid of bringing something in because they worked from home and I was out working with the public every day. I've even been going to a few small gatherings with other vaccinated people. I had pretty bad anxiety over the past year and getting vaccinated did help me feel much less trapped.

It was the right choice for me but I can understand if it's not the right choice for you. I just wanted to share my experience with it. :)",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 23:10:28
"Well full disclosure I‚Äôm one of the gung ho vaccine people.

For work I‚Äôm in charge of our COVID safety program at our essential manufacturing company, so I‚Äôve helped sign up 90 employees with shots going back to January.  I‚Äôd say about a third to half of employees reported side effects that lasted until usually 48 hours after a shot. I have had no reports of long term side effects. 

It‚Äôs pretty established medical science going back to the 60s that if you are going to see a side effect from the vaccine (any vaccine not just COVID vaccines), it‚Äôs going to be within the first two months.  https://www.muhealth.org/our-stories/how-do-we-know-covid-19-vaccine-wont-have-long-term-side-effects

I have however talked to everyone at our company who has contracted COVID, as we follow up throughout their course of their illness.  A good amount of our employees had it pretty rough, including one on a ventilator and was near death.  

One thing I don‚Äôt understand though, as this is a common thing I hear from people, who worry about long term consequences.  We don‚Äôt have any long term consequences documented from the COVID vaccine (and as I mentioned above that‚Äôs not really a thing with vaccines).  We do many cases reported of long term consequences from catching COVID though. I have employees and friends that are still dealing with consequences from COVID a year later.  Isn‚Äôt the vaccine worth protecting from those long term COVID side effects?

Edit: Also I had my first Moderna shot in January, second one in late February.  After my second dose I had a super mild fever that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have noticed had I not been a nerd about this stuff (100.3).  I got pretty tired for a couple of hours.  But it was all cleared up after the second day.",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 13:00:53
"The first thing I would suggest is following Jessica Malaty Rivera on IG. She is an epidemiologist and science communicator. She has an episode or two on one of my fave podcast, Ologies. She focuses a lot on debunking myths and misinformation about the vaccines and is big on a no judgment approach when it comes to vaccine hesitation. There‚Äôs another podcast called This Podcast Will Kill You hosted by two epidemiologist about infectious diseases and they have several episodes on covid, the covid vaccine and a pre-covid episode about vaccines in general. 
 
As far as your worries about long term effects, I got my second dose of moderna in mid February and I feel great. I know there‚Äôs a lot of chatter about menstrual changes, and for me if anything my period was lighter after my first dose. I have endometriosis, so that was VERY welcome. I‚Äôd take that shot every month if I could. My hormones are already pretty fucked up because of the endo and I tend to have pretty big inflammatory reactions to things since things are already inflamed as it is. I experienced a bit of an endo flare in an area that is very easily irritated because of internal scar tissue and some other endometriosis related stuff. It resolved within a few days, as is normal when I get a flare. I had the same exact thing when I had to get an MRI with contrast dye, in fact the dye was worse. So, you know, only you can make this choice for yourself and I know there are a lot of scary anecdotes out there but much like restaurant reviews the bad stories are the ones you remember most. Well over a billion vaccines have been administered world wide and most people like me who were fine after aren‚Äôt going to jump in to share their experience. And my hormones are already haywire, plus I deal with chronic inflammation. You‚Äôre likely in a much better situation that I was going into the process.",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 01:06:34
"I was on the fence about getting the vaccine as well (I have people that I'm close to who refuse to get vaccinated). I got the first shot of Moderna a few days ago and haven't experienced any side effects aside from a sore arm and mood swings.

I'm more concerned about how the vaccine interacts with variants than the vaccine side effects themselves though.

Whichever you choose, I hope you are at peace with your decision.",nhdh9m,2021-05-20 23:48:11
"I never get the flu shot but I got the vaccine and had a good experience. I got Moderna. One of my biggest reasons for getting it was to get back to normal. I have gone to several parties recently that required proof of vaccination and it feels amazing to be back to normal, no masks, having a good time. All of these have been private occasions except one college graduation. I imagine in the future you are going to run into concerts/events that will require vaccines as a corporate policy.

If your partner is very antivax, then getting the vaccine could also protect him since if one of you gets covid it‚Äôs almost inevitable you both would. Sure, you are low risk but not no risk. Imagine losing your sense of smell for like 6 months :(",nhdh9m,2021-05-20 23:50:53
"It‚Äôs your decision, but I‚Äôll add my own experience: I‚Äôm a germaphobe, and that was even before covid. I followed all of the guidelines and I still caught this virus. It attacked my lungs, thyroid, and heart, all of which are still effected by the damage caused. It probably impacted other organs as well, but I just haven‚Äôt had them checked. Without giving too much detail, I am not someone who people would ‚Äúexpect‚Äù to have a bad experience with covid. I developed presumed pneumonia and was put on medications, but I was never hospitalized - and that‚Äôs considered a ‚Äúmild‚Äù case for covid. My oxygen dropped to the 80s at one point, which is considered a medical emergency. Meanwhile, my family members were around me without masks on while I was symptomatic (fever and chills, but didn‚Äôt know that it was covid yet). They were all vaccinated (not J&J), and they did not get sick at all. Not even a stuffy nose or scratchy throat. From then on, I trusted that the vaccines work.",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 22:53:53
Go get that J&j! Glad you are picking the right vaccine for you.,nhdh9m,2021-05-20 23:45:13
"I took the J&J back on 3/12 - I had no fever, no chills, a very sore arm for a couple days and felt like I had been run over by a truck.  It did kind of freak me out when they pulled it for investigation, but I am glad it's over with.  My daughter 28 also took it - she had fever, chills and tired for a couple days.    -",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 14:36:44
"I got Moderna and just had body aches and chills for a few days after the 2nd shot, and then back to normal. I work in health care, all my co workers got vaccinated right when the vaccine became available and I haven't heard of anyone having long term effects. I don't think there are any documented long term effects from the covid vaccine. However, if you get a COVID virus infection, you can definitely have long term effects. I have seen young patients end up in the hospital with covid and have to stay on oxygen for months after going home. These are life saving vaccines, it is your decision but you really shouldn't fear the vaccine.",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 15:59:10
"You are not alone! I also was very anxious about getting the vaccine and almost chickened out while I was waiting for my first Moderna dose. Although I‚Äôve never had a reaction to other vaccines I‚Äôm very sensitive to drugs. I work with a foreign company that made the vaccine available to its employees in a country where only the 0.1% of people have been vaccinated and there are only 1,370 beds available for COVID public hospitalization nationwide. To me being a caretaker of my elderly dad, a smoker and having chronic venous insufficiency outweighed my fear to get the vaccine. If I passed the opportunity of being vaccinated that would‚Äôve meant to wait 3 to 4 years to get the vaccine through the Public health system. I have lost friends to COVID and I also didn‚Äôt want to put the financial load on my family if I contracted COVID and needed private hospitalization (Private hospitals are requiring a $22,000 deposit upon COVID hospitalization). I had the worst side effects to both doses but they didn‚Äôt last more than a week. Would I do it again? Yes! I‚Äôd rather suffer for a week than having to suffer for the rest of my life or worse, lose my life. But that‚Äôs me and my decision. Read all the information available, fact-check that information and take a decision you are comfortable with. If you decide to get the vaccine, keep hydrated!",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 16:08:34
"31F, just got my 2nd Pfizer dose yesterday, I was very anxious about side effects as I‚Äôd done a lot of doomscrolling and also had several coworkers who had to take off work a day or 2 after their shots. I have severe health anxiety and had done a lot of research into negative side effects. I didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night, and was totally primed to be in the ER by midnight. Eventually I did fall asleep when my mind just got so exhausted I couldn‚Äôt stop it.

It‚Äôs been 20 hours and...I‚Äôm fine. Today I have a minor headache, some nausea and general malaise but nothing worse than I‚Äôve had with a cold or a really bad period. I will fully admit that I am still nervous - can‚Äôt ever fully turn off the monkey in my brain - but at the end of the day for me it was a no brainer. The benefits outweighed the risks, and I‚Äôve got too many experiences I haven‚Äôt been able to do because of COVID. I missed a whole year of life because of lockdown. I value my job, my family, my elderly neighbors and my own health to risk the chance of catching it. 

Just my opinion, obviously - I hope you feel better OP üòä",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 18:28:00
"I know exactly how you feel. My husband and I were hesitant. But we are 48 and 47 even though we are in good health , thin , and no underlying conditions, we felt the risk of Covid isn‚Äôt worth it. I am still skeptical of the messenger RNA vaccines and felt more confident with the JNJ. We both got the J&J 2 days ago . The anxiety about it was worse than the side effects  of the vaccine. The only thing we had is being really tired that‚Äôs about it. Everyone is different though . We are just happy to be one and done.  I am not sure how much you weigh, but please be aware that even young people are getting ill , especially if  overweight or obese,  even if you have no underlying conditions. Good luck !!!",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 20:29:41
"Yea so I think that‚Äôs a big problem with vaccine conversations- they‚Äôre either 1,000% for it or against it. And I would argue that most people are in the middle on it so people need to be talking about being where you are!

I‚Äôm vaccine injured and haven‚Äôt had any vaccines since that last one in 2013. 
But 
As much as I didn‚Äôt want this one, I knew it was the right thing to do. I had to take a Xanax and slow cried in the waiting room, it was a lot‚Ä¶ 
To make the choice, I weighed the pros and cons and decided to get it. It‚Äôs normal to be put off by it when there‚Äôs such strong polarizing views all around you. 

And ‚Ä¶I mean if your dude won‚Äôt get it, you can rest easier knowing that when you‚Äôre vaccinated you will be much less likely to pass it to him.

"Some facts, if it helps:

* If you get infected with the virus, it will go all over your body and stay there for at least a week and be much more likely to cause you long-term problems than the vaccine.
* If you get the vaccine, it will prime your immune system, but then the vaccine is gone. It will not be with you anymore.
* More than 95% of the doctors who have been offered this vaccine have gotten it as soon as they can.
* The more we vaccinate, the faster we can get back to growing our economy and getting jobs.
* If people get vaccinated, we're going to save at least 100,000 lives of Americans who would otherwise be killed by COVID.

I am even more anxious about that, since I've heard most people react more strongly to the second one. Also I was worried about clots and how it would impact my period.

"I have some of the same concerns. I have had all the standard vaccines one should normally get but never seen the range and variety of experiences one can have from covid vaccines. My work involved being in isolation / covid positive areas or wings for a few minutes each day.  Also eventually 2 family members who worked in public also tested positive yet I was negative. We all quarantined 2 weeks , I did not isolate from my family. Retested at  14 days and I was still negative. But it looks like even though the federal government can't require vac because it is only emergency FDA approval it seems States can ( for work ).

Wrong. The mRNA technology has been developed/studied for years and the first versions of these vaccines can be traced back to SARS.,nhdh9m,2021-05-21 21:57:59
"The fact of the matter is that if you were going to see side effects with the COVID vaccine, you'd actually see them **sooner** than with other vaccines.   It's one of the reasons that they used the mRNA platform, it'd be much quicker to gauge the safety/efficacy than with other vaccines where the side effects might show up a month later.

The mRNA is out of your system after 24 hours, and the spike protein peaks at 48 hours and if out of your system after 72.

>we don‚Äôt have long term studies on the jab because it just came out and COVID has been out there for over a year

The COVID vaccines aren't something that were just developed.  They started early-stage trials at the end of last April (2020).  They have been testing it since then.  

Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA for decades.  mRNA vaccines (for  flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus) have also been studied in the past as well.",nhdh9m,2021-05-21 21:11:35

Sore arm and my inflamed joints were a little more inflamed for 24 hours. Im 55. I was worried about hormonal effects since I was brought out of menopause and increased a bra size from a very small amount of CBD/CBG oil over 3 weeks. haha It was the CBG oil, haven't found any reports on anyone else having the issue. All back to normal now. The body can be very strange sometimes.

Hormone issues is also a side effect of the flu shot and other shots as well. The flu shot is the most common shot that women have so it is the most reported. There have been studies, search for flu shot affecting hormones. I have found multiple comments from physicians and the effect on hormones. They all report that it clears at the longest 3 months.

What did happen to me emotionally is I conquered a project that I have been putting off for months. Too bad it wore off, I would literally pay big bucks for a shot that cures procrastination. hahaha

As far as the mRNA tech. Novavax is an alternative if it ever gets submitted for EUA. They need to resolve some supply issues before the FDA will even consider it. It already contains the spike protein, your body makes none of it. J&J works similar to Moderna and Pfizer it just uses a virus to enter the cell and produce the spike protein. 

Novavax was the one I wanted but it was just taking too long to submit for approval. I have a bone marrow disorder that causes high platelet counts (ET) so getting Covid is not an option. I want my life back. I miss my kids.",nhdh9m,2021-05-22 02:13:20

On the other hand, **[covid is known to cause blood clots](https://khn.org/news/clots-strokes-and-rashes-is-covid-a-disease-of-the-blood-vessels/)**, and the chances of that are **much** higher: around **1 in 100**.

"I have a theory! It's just a theory, I haven't found evidence in the form of studies for all parts of it yet, but it might help.

In general, women have more side effects after receiving vaccines. This is because of our hormone balance. The way men's hormones are and women's hormones are deal with vaccines differently. The vaccine triggers the immune response, which is then enhanced by female sex hormones.

This is where it gets to speculation. I'm thinking that some of the hormones are used up with the immune response leading to a hormone imbalance. This could mean you have less hormones and it triggers the start of a cycle or something else. This is where my Google research started failing me. But it's a theory. Female hormones are used in the immune response triggered by vaccines. If anyone can expand on this or show proof I'm completely off base, please respond.",ngyu30,2021-05-20 20:46:35

"Yeah. That link tells you when to see a doctor or when to be worried about it, so that's helpful.

How many women have literally never missed a period? How many have irregular periods? Just in general. It's not abnormal.

If you miss 3 in a row, see a doctor. If you have abdominal pain, trouble eating, extreme fatigue, see a doctor. This is in your link. Among other ""when to see a doctor"" tips.

It's not abnormal to miss one period. For a period to be a bit early.

I do believe the vaccine impacts this. It's not causing infertility or anything else. It's a normal, hormonal reaction. It happens with medications and vaccines frequently. 

Yes, I would like to know why this is happening. So many things can impact a period. Food. Not enough food. Dietary changes, stress, birth control, etc. It's usually nothing horrible. I hope we do figure this out. As well as why so many other things do.",ngyu30,2021-05-20 23:29:24

1030am vaccinated it barely even hurt (honestly I kept waiting for more and then it was over) the nurse was chatty said everyone there had gotten this vaccine in my age range and there was nothing to worry about went home after the 15 minutes felt fine then started on the 2 jobs I have right now(doordash lunch and then my full time job in the evenings) everything was pretty good besides the slightly sore arm until about 7pm at my full time job after I ate dinner I got chills and my teeth were chattering. After going to the restroom a couple times it seemed to pass and honestly I wasn't doing too bad once I got home. 

The real fun started when I went to sleep around 1am. It seemed like I initially started good and then somewhere in the 3-4am timeframe I woke up in a daze like I'm not kidding it didn't even feel like my bed and I was burning up to the point I felt sick. It felt like I was in a dream honestly. This went on and off for over 2 hours I got up a few times had bad coughing tried to cool my head with a cold towel eventually threw up a couple times. Turned the A/C down in the apartment. In between this I kept trying to get back in bed and it just wasn't happening. I didn't feel it. Like I said above it felt like I somewhere else I didn't recognize. Nothing was comfortable or like wanting to sleep. I guess somewhere around sunrise I feel asleep for about 3 hours with just the sheet on top of me

Woke up this morning other than a sore throat from the coughing I haven't felt much today. The arm doesn't even  hurt. Not even a real lack of sleep which I was expecting (in the past if I don't get at least 5-6 hours I usually am miserable all day) Did both my jobs eating didn't trigger anything.

"I read that it has to do with gene composition or something to that effect. There's no way to account for everyone's unique immune system ""code"", so vaccines are developed to harm the least amount of people possible. Of course you're going to get that .0001% or so that develops severe problems, but the thing with these people is, if a vaccine didn't do that to them then a certain virus most likely would have.

People occasionally develop issues like long-term paralysis and POTS from viruses such as the flu, and in fact, with more frequency than with vaccines. For example I developed chronic rhinitis from a flu I had all the way back in 2013-ish. I developed long-term POTS from a very common, safe medication that's considered one of the safest, most benign meds on the market. It has more to do with the behavior of the person's immune system than the vaccine or illness.

TL;DR: don't stress out about vaccinating your kids. The benefits outweigh the risks almost every time. If a vaccine gave your child something like POTS, etc., chances are that they would have also got it from measles or mumps or the flu because their immune system had a weird fault to begin with. It doesn't necessarily mean the vaccine is dangerous unless huge amounts of people are getting messed up from it in a consistent way, then obviously the vaccine is the problem.",nh2pcd,2021-05-21 04:23:49

"I repeat--they are not vaccines.  A vaccine is an attenuated or deactivated version of a virus that is injected into the body and immunity is built from that 'dead' virus.  These C-19 ""vaccines"" is a rna message telling your ribosomes to produce spike proteins from a coronavirus.  That's not a vaccine by definition.  It literally teaches your dna to do something it was not originally intended to do.  I.E -- GENE THERAPY.  That's not to say gene therapy doesn't have its uses.  It was originally intended to be customized to the patient.  For instance, a patient may have recurrent prostate cancer.  A gene therapy can send an rna message to one's dna and tell it to never grow cancer sells--that's a very abbreviated version of it.  But that's the idea.   However, giving it to EVERYONE is bad news because everyone's different and what's more with a coronavirus (a virus that mutates so often), a gene therapy is not effective, appropriate or even safe.  That's why vaccinated people are still wearing masks--they don't even believe that it's going to keep them safe.  Sure people have survived the jab as well as dropped dead after getting it.  But long term we really don't know how it will affect us.  I'd rather just wait and see instead of be a guinea pig and give my body to science free of charge to Big Pharma and the gov't.   So yea...

Minors can make their own decisions to go on birth control or to be treated for STDs without their parents consent. And they can make their own decisions about abortion (b/c in that case, they'd be pregnant, thus emancipated)

Having a child doesn't make you emancipated. Weirdly, if you give birth to a child at age 17, you can then make decisions about the baby's shots, but you still need YOUR parents' permission to get yourself vaccinated, until after your 18th birthday.

This is false.  a)  Not all monkeys were euthanized.  Most monkeys in most trials weren't euthanized.  AZ was the only study that euthanized all monkeys which occurred 7 days POST CHALLENGE.  Not post vaccine administration.  A total time of 9 weeks after first injection. 

> The ones I'm referencing were performed with ferrets and cats.

>Also what are the long term effects of this? Right no studies on that either.

No drug or vaccine on the planet or that can ever be created is ""totally"" safe.  They are highly effective against COVID-19, though.
To think that they aren't is drinking the anti-vaxx kool-aid.

>Any idea why 40%+ at NIH refuse to get vaccinated? 

The NIH has 22,000+ working there with only 6000 scientists.  If you want to know who isn't getting the vaccine, it isn't the scientists.  It's the support staff who have been sitting comfortably at home for months while the scientists risk getting COVID every day when they go to work for 60-100 hours a week.

But, and I must stress this, she was very ill with multiple complex health problems before she caught the virus. The vaccination isn't a magic bullet; the idea is you'll be far less likely to get very ill and of course die.

But not being sure it was actually watermelon, I tried eating it again a couple of months later. Yep, definitely watermelon. So ""natural"" things can cause hives just like the unnatural.

Hives are just one of those weird autoimmune reactions that can happen to anyone at anytime for nearly any reason (and sometimes for reasons that can't be determined.) So, to defend the person who said getting hives is a normal reaction, it's kind of true, at least in our modern world.

In case you don't read it here are some parts I copied and pasted.

""Human gene therapy seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use¬†1.

Gene therapy is a technique that modifies a person‚Äôs genes to treat or cure disease. Gene therapies can work by several mechanisms:

Replacing a disease-causing gene with a healthy copy of the gene

Inactivating a disease-causing gene that is not functioning properly

Introducing a new or modified gene into the body to help treat a disease

Gene therapy products are being studied to treat diseases including cancer, genetic diseases, and infectious diseases.

....

""Viral vectors:¬†Viruses have a natural ability to deliver genetic material into cells, and therefore some gene therapy products are derived from viruses. Once viruses have been modified to remove their ability to cause infectious disease, these modified viruses can be used as vectors (vehicles) to carry therapeutic genes into human cells.""

From Moderna's website:

""Using mRNA as a drug opens up a breadth of opportunities to treat and prevent disease.¬†mRNA medicines can go inside cells to direct protein production, something not possible with other drug approaches.¬†We have the potential to treat or prevent diseases that today are not addressable ‚Äì potentially improving human health and impacting lives around the world.""

They state they are using antigens from a virus and using mRNA to put it in our DNA.  To show our bodies how to create proteins to fight the virus.

In conclusion, just because they are labeling it as a vaccine, doesn't mean it's not gene therapy.",nghiok,2021-05-20 05:50:20

"oh no.... im a frequent sufferer of backpain, headaches and tension, so this is how i manage and, and just my sepculation on side effects. got both moderna shots and both times i was super dehydrated for a couple of days, which caused similar issues of neck tension and mild headaches. hydration plays a huge role in  preventing these. dehydration tenses up the muscles, which can cause tension headaches if it is around the neck/upperback/shoulder area. chills, muscle aches, and profuse sweating also dont help since it further dehydrates you which tenses up your muscles even more. while i dont think neck kinks are a side effect of the vaccine, likely the side effect of a vaccine contributes to this condition.

"I began having heart palpitations 7 days after my first dose of Pfizer on 3/25 which was followed by a tachycardia episode of a heart rate of 150 bpm sitting still. Urgent care ran an ekg that was normal and my heart rate went down. They diagnosed me with anxiety even though my anxiety never presented with heart problems before. Since then my heart rate has been normal but I‚Äôve had frequent heart palpitations followed with occasional accompanying pain. I went to my PCP and told her about the palpitations and the brain fog that also was plaguing me and was sent for a thyroid panel.
I was diagnosed with hashimoto‚Äôs hypothyroidism after that panel and they also found a nodule on my thyroid. To be clear, I never had any of these problems prior to this. I just had an echocardiogram that was normal and I‚Äôm currently on a heart monitor that is showing intermittent sinus tachycardia. My second dose was 4/15 for reference.",ngs03s,2021-05-23 21:33:22

It will take a few months for things to balance out again since you need to go through a few cycles. My ovulation in the cycle after the second vaccine was a whole week early, and I'm waiting on my period (although from resting heart rate data it looks like I should have already had it). 

I can't imagine the pain and acne issues you're going through, but all I can say is trust the process, and I hope to fking god that doctors and researchers start taking women's hormones more seriously.

"Pfizer here. Didn't notice anything with first shot, which was taken right around when I usually start. I think I remember it being a fairly short and easy cycle, which isn't typically the case for me but has been becoming more the norm now that I'm in my early 30s.  


The second shot I received on the 4th of May however made me about two weeks late, started my cycle about 4 days ago on the 16th vs 1st-4th of the month. It's not really been 100% normal ie. darker, more viscous maybe? as well as being less even in amount (will be normal flow for two hours then be very light flow for the rest of the day, or until I pee sometimes and it's just like heyooo).   


The second dose was so close to when I was supposed to start and I got my period so close to the two week period of when the vaccine reaches max efficiency I highly doubt that the two aren't unrelated. I pretty much assumed when I started that meant I must have reached the max efficiency point and that my body was able to spare some energy to give me my cycle back.

FWIW I've only ever been this late in about 19 years three times, one time was because I wasn't eating and was under very acute stress, second time was like the first plus I had taken two z packs for pneumonia and was on some kind of steroid, and the other was because my body (and I suppose myself) were under very acute stress both medically and mentally and I could have pretty easily died. I only say this because in my mind with these facts about how certain situations affect my cycle and how rarely it happens, I can't help but assume 100% it had to do with the vaccine.

That said, I'm not too worried about it. I'm sorry yours seems to be so much rougher, it hasn't really bothered me much at all other than resulting in me taking a pregnancy test and being annoyed when I finally started the day I was slated to go to the zoo.

My second cycle was late and very light. I have just recently stop having spotting consistently throughout my cycle. It‚Äôs taken three cycles from the first shot, but I think at least the bleeding part is getting back on track.

When I expressed concern to friends my gf said she has had sore breasts and hasnt had more than tiny spotting in 4 months! No actual period since her second dose in Feb.

However, as a person at risk of clots, I am constantly told I cannot take any hormonal birth control, especially not something that will increase my estrogen, because the risk of clotting is much higher. So, with the countless women who have experience these hormonal changes, how on earth can they say positively that it is safe for those of us with FVL to get the vaccine? 

Not to mention, I know there are MANY people who suffer from this gene mutation who are hesitant to get the vaccine, and thus have not gotten it yet. So to compare the rates at which people are getting blood clots with covid (mind you, those who are getting clots are the bad cases, which are elderly and/or overweight), seems extremely disingenuous and actually dangerous.

tret is pretty powerful so it‚Äôs important to ease into it and not use too much. i use differin (similar to tret, still strong but available over-the-counter) and i eased into it by applying it **over** moisturizer every other day, never more than like 1/2 pea size amount for my entire face. i just dot it all over my face so i get it evenly spread. now i use it every other day under moisturizer (same 1/2 pea size amount) without any issues, and it does amazing things for my skin texture and fading hyperpigmentation.

anyway i know your skin may not be your #1 concern, but tret (and differin) can make a huge difference for a lot of people so i wanted to chime in just in case a bad experience put you off trying it again! r/tretinoin might also be worth looking into for other people‚Äôs experience/advice. skin issues suck, so i definitely sympathize and i hope your symptoms ease up soon.",ng5vku,2021-05-20 07:08:04

"You seem incredibly uninformed. Your first statement is a lie. Long term side effects can occur years (5...10...sometimes more) after the injection was taken. That is precisely why they are called LONG TERM effects. 

Your second statement is wrong, also. These injections have, in fact, been rushed. The covid vaccines are the only vaccines that have taken only MONTHS to create and test, whereas every other vaccine has taken YEARS to develop (~10 years, sometimes more). Every other vaccine besides these covid vaccines have also had strict, rigorous testing standards that these covid vaccines have failed to meet. For example, they essentially skipped animal testing and began testing on humans right away. 

The only thing the trials tested was whether the vaccines reduced the risk of mild covid symptoms.

First shot: didn't have any side effects other than a bit of pain where the shot went in, but nothing crazy.

Lots of things also cause this, including stress, diet changes, activity and exercise level changes, and illness. The probable reason for menstrual changes is the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is part of the immune system. When you have an immune response, that part is impacted, which impacts your period.

We'll never really know the stats though, because since May 1, the CDC stops counting vaccinated people who test positive for covid unless they're hospitalized or die:

""As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause. This shift will help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance.""

Are you aware that they can result in a side effect that basically results in the skin dying and detaching from the body? Just about pharmaceutical has severe adverse effects associated with them, but it's the frequency of those effects that you should be concerned with. The risk of COVID is a much greater and more immediate risk than an extremely rare adverse reaction from the vaccine.

Otherwise, it really doesn't sound like the kind of thing to worry about. First, people *aren't* suddenly dropping dead or critically sick after vaccination - not any more than they would have otherwise.

Post-Covid myocarditis isn't completely understood yet. It could be caused by the virus infecting cardiac muscle itself or by an overenthusiastic immune response. The vaccines can't cause the former, but it looks like they sometimes cause the latter. Not as much as a Covid infection itself, though.

So can you get myocarditis for the first time following a shot? It's plausible, but not common enough to be confirmed yet. Can it cause a relapse if you had post-Covid myocarditis? That seems more plausible.

A better reason to skip a day-after workout is that there's a good chance that you'll be flu-like sick that day. Not sure if that's what you're asking about though.

"Why do I see you lying in every single post on this subreddit?

>More than 95% of the doctors who have been offered this vaccine have gotten it as soon as they can.

**You posted this figure, when it comes from a Facebook Group poll. This is data that comes from asking people in a Facebook Group.**

From the article:

>To confirm her suspicion that it was not physicians who were declining the vaccine, Taylor posted a poll on two large physician-only Facebook pages. Out of nearly 3,000 physician respondents, 95% said that they had either already received or planned to receive their COVID-19 vaccine.

In what world do we take scientific advice or data, from Facebook Polls?

(Here is the link you shared previously: [https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/physicians-highly-accepting-of-covid-19-vaccine](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/physicians-highly-accepting-of-covid-19-vaccine))

(Also, you say  that 95% of doctors ""have gotten it"" when clearly in that source, that is not supported at all there as well...)

Facebook polls are not data that you should share to back up your points with regards to science.

Also,

>The more we vaccinate, the faster we can get back to growing our economy and getting jobs.

This is just not empirically supported whatsoever. Any economy does benchmark their growth or job creation on vaccination rates. Vaccines are not required to hire, or to work, or to innovate.

"> lol, and how many people have died with the normal flu in the past few years? 

2017/2018 flu season had around 61,000 deaths caused by flu in the US.  So roughly 1 in 5,410 people.

>How many people actually felt something while having Covid? 

Unqualitifable, because people get asymptomatic infections and don't realize they had COVID, or get COVID symptoms and assume it's some other disease and don't get tested.

>With the vaccine you still be a carrier 

If you are not having COVID-like symptoms and are vaccinated, it is virtually impossible for you to spread the virus.

>and people still died with covid after having their vaccine. 

With it, not *of* it.

>What a coincidence that a vaccine came out after 6 months of Covid? 

I don't even know what the means.  We've been working on mRNA vaccines for decades now, and mRNA vaccines for SARS, MERS, and Zika existed before the COVID outbreak in late 2019.  It was ""plug and play"" to create a vaccine for COVID-19, which is why mRNA technology kicks so much ass.

Also, the J&J shot you were going to get is *not* an mRNA vaccine, but an adenovirus-vectored vaccine, which have been around even longer.

>How did the vaccines release all after each other? 

Because that's how long safety trials took, and they all started around the same time because that's when we were able to genetically sequence the virus to figure out how to make a vaccine against it.

>Why are all the verified and accepted vaccines from the US?

They're not.  Pfizer was less involved in the creation of the vaccine than N-Biotech, a German company.",ngvqdt,2021-05-20 20:01:25

Yeah, we really do.  This is science and vaccines aren't voodoo.

>And we also totally know what were doing to our bodies with a new type of vaccine. MRNA vaccines are not traditional

We've been using mRNA vaccines for over 50 years now.  You just don't seem to realize it.  The measles vaccine, mumps vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and nasal influenza vaccine are all ""mRNA"" vaccines.  They just use the virus to deliver the vaccine the cells (which is also composed of a lipid) rather than just a non-live lipid in the case of Pfizer and Moderna.  Once those live virus vaccines enter the cells, they do the exact same thing that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines do, except even more than that because they also replicate in vivo.  Pfizer and Moderna don't.

>Isnt it terrifying on its own that every news outlet and mainstream scientist is preaching that the vaccine has no effect on women‚Äôs menstrual cycles yet most of the comments here are about women saying its effecting their menstruation? 

The mainstream scientist opinion is more data needs to be collected.  It's fairly common to see menstrual cycle irregularities with vaccination in adults (as well as natural infection).  This isn't anything new here and nothing to be concerned about.  People were trying to make the same claims about the HPV vaccine while us scientists just kind of sat back and rolled our eyes.

>Honestly your hostile tone in your last message tells me all i need to know about you.

"I had some fatigue after second Pfizer. The real party started after a week. Throat, coughing, tired, flu-like etc. Every day aroung 1 p.m. better in the evening, gone in the morning, then starting again. Lasted for two weeks (no covid had test), then slowly better. Six weeks after second shot now, still fighting fatigue and brain fog. I have several autoimmune diseases plus heart trouble  plus am post chemo and twice radiation. So I think real covid would have killed me fast.",ng8pl2,2021-05-20 13:12:13
"I live alone so unfortunately when the response from the 2nd dose hit me overnight, I started shivering and I thought my bedroom was cold at first so I curled up in my duvet blanket. I noticed my mouth, ears nose, lips, and sorry a little TMI urine were hot. I took my temperature and bam it was 102.5 F and I was like WTF... why am I shivering cold and hot in the face with fever at the same time? I guess I wasn‚Äôt treating my fever the way I was supposed to either haha . Anyway, The fever was a little too high for my comfort so I took Advil and eventually, it went down and I fell asleep. 24 hours after getting the 2nd shot, I was back to normal with no fever or aches and just a sore arm from the shot. It was the weirdest sickness I experienced because of how fast it came and went.",ng9kai,2021-05-19 19:50:21

It's like the second I fade off to sleep my brain jolts me awake, and then I see every single hour on the clock until 8am. I have been having sleep issues since before the vaccine, but definitely not this intense. Usually I'm up once or twice a night, not once an hour all through the night.",ng12b0,2021-05-25 15:03:00
"Yup, that's been my experience. Day 0 started with a bunch of the less-common side effects (headache, shivering, fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, lymph node swelling, etc). I did not expect the insomnia. It reminds me of the bad old days of college!

I'm on Day 5 after my 2nd jab. I suspect that the sleep deprivation caused minor psychedelic visual effects like long tracers after moving objects, auras around objects, and bright vivid colors. No shadow people yet at least.  :0

The first few nights the insomnia took several forms: I couldn't get to sleep (like I'd start yawning and then suddenly snap into wakefulness), when I was asleep I'd only sleep for about 3 hours at most, and when I'd wake up I couldn't get back to sleep for several hours. My asshole cats knocked things off of the kitchen counter on two different nights, which is how I learned that if something woke me up I wasn't getting back to sleep. Even if I only got 2hrs of sleep, it took about 5hrs for me to collapse into bed again.

At day 5, I'm feeling ""better"" but didn't get more than 5-6 hours of sleep last night. I know I woke up somewhere between 1-3 times, but I was able to fall back asleep after the interruptions. Still have a hard time going to sleep despite being tired. 

I've had to take almost a week off of work because of this, but I ain't driving a damn vehicle this tired. I wouldn't drive drunk and I'm not going to drive sleep-deprived drunk. I sliced my thumb with the wickedly sharp knife last night because I was tired, and I haven't done that in years.",ng12b0,2021-05-25 19:01:39

"I won't beat around the bush here.  Because you previously had COVID, you're most likely going to feel this one pretty hard.  It's going to be like getting the second vaccine dose which tends to be more severe for a lot of people.  But, because you were very sick with COVID only in February, you might still have decent antibody levels already against the spike protein.  If that's the case, then you may feel nothing at all.  You're kind of at the cut off line for that (~3 months) reaction though.  

You should still absolutely get the vaccine as antibodies from natural infection tend to be a lot lower than with vaccination.  But, just be prepared for quite a bit of uneasiness.  Ibuprofen is your friend (even though they will recommend Tylenol...I'd go with ibuprofen after 6-8 hours if you need it).",ng3cbp,2021-05-19 16:45:43

So the next year I was afraid of the seasonal flu shot and had it done in an allergist's office, where they put it under my skin first, waited, then more under skin but deeper , waited, then after no reactions gave it in my arm.   I was FINE!

Now I teake the quadravalent every year and have never again had any kind of reaction.

For me its a little tension from my neck to back of my head. I can live with it but the lightheadedness is preventing me from doing anything productive for a week now.,ng2b01,2021-05-22 17:39:27

"Most people had lasting issues related to the first dose mainly, the second dose not neccesarily inflicting any extra side effects. I also had dome shitty side effects after dose 1(mainly in regards to my menstrual cycle) but i said fuck it, lets go all the way. The 2nd dose went far better for me and I don't regret it. Plus, most countries will want you to have a full vaccination to be immunized against covid so I think if you have the chance to take it, you should!",ng0ite,2021-05-19 13:00:59
"If you had really intense symptoms for 1st dose you may feel fine for 2nd dose! I think the extra protection from 2nd dose is worth it, especially with all the variants, but I‚Äôm sorry you had a rough first go around!",ng0ite,2021-05-19 13:12:08

"I have friends who are worried about side effects and are choosing to get a more conventional vaccine then the mRNA vaccines. These friends all do basic research in biochem or microbiology and are very far from antivax or vac hesitant. They‚Äôre in the minority of my friend group, and also like you able to stay safe and away from people. 

Most of the people I know (also bio backgrounds, grad school does that too you) were pretty excited to get an mRNA vaccine. But it is an more experimental technology. 

And far as sides affects, I wanted to avoid J&J, but that‚Äôs really out of an abundance of caution and because I‚Äôm been on hormonal birth control for a long time so I‚Äôm already at a higher risk of blood clots. I got Moderna and after the second dose I had a pretty high fever for the first time since I was a kid, but nothing lasting. 

The other thing that I would keep in mind is that people posting on this thread aren‚Äôt an unbiased representation of the side effects. I planned on posting my experience, but it was fairly mild and I actually forgot. If I were having more severe or lasting side effects I would have been nervously reading this thread and probably would have posted.",nftyno,2021-05-19 05:27:06
"I, my husband and most of my friends are vaccinated. (Moderna and Pfizer) and no one has had any issues! The worst was flu symptoms that my husband had. I too was skeptical about the vaccines and sometimes I do get worried again but I gotta say I am so relieved to be vaccinated! I want my life back and living in fear of the virus has been very awful to say the least. I live in Florida and the cases here are so extreme. Knowing my hubby and I are protected brings peace of mind. 

If you are worried definitely speak to a doctor! They can give you a professional opinion and give you more information about how the vaccines are.",nftyno,2021-05-19 12:41:30
I‚Äôm 28 I got moderna if you want to know about the experience after for both shots feel free to ask I don‚Äôt want to just ramble if it‚Äôs not wanted lol. My final verdict. Your choice ! I‚Äôm not here to guide or advise you do anything with your health as I am not a health professional. However I can say myself that even tho I‚Äôm healthy low risk male I‚Äôm 6 feet 170 I‚Äôm a runner I workout etc and I got it and the best feeling about it is knowing Im at the gym and don‚Äôt have to worry as much I‚Äôm grocery shopping around a crowd in public transit I‚Äôm not having little bouts of anxiety. Ontop of it my whole house hold is vaxxed so Knowing our home is basicly like a little safety bubble to covid lol is kinda nice I don‚Äôt have to worry about anyone contracting it and everyone else life in the house get effected I don‚Äôt have to worry about someone catching it and getting long covid with symptoms that persist for months etc.,nftyno,2021-05-19 08:37:27

"It is ultimately up to you, but remember that most people seek out this subreddit to issue their complaints/side effects. 

There have been 1.38 billion doses given so far. 
Even if you take into account complaints on VAERS (vaccine adverse reactions) that‚Äôs only 900,000 approx side effects (varying from incredibly mild to quite severe) 

So you probably have a large amount of people who don‚Äôt get side effects or get mild side effects who don‚Äôt post them. From what I‚Äôve heard the majority of people don‚Äôt have many side effects. 

There‚Äôs a lot of posts in this subreddit too of good experiences.",nftyno,2021-05-19 04:05:56
"I am a post-menopausal woman in my late 50s & got the J&J/Janssen shot. Reaction started at appx 24 hours w mild fatigue. Muscle soreness at 36 hours, and more fatigue. Around the 60 hours mark, I was back on my feet, but slightly moody. The moody thing was what caught me off guard. By 72 hours, I was back to normal. I have zero health conditions and take no medicines. I was antibody positive prior to vaccination but have never (8 swabs across many months) tested positive. 

We hear about all the horror stories because ""I got infected but never knew"" or ""I had minimal side effects that ended in less than 3 days"" are not gory media events that drive advertising dollars. For every CV19 diagnosis, perhaps 4, 5, even 6 people are asymptomatic and utterly unaware they have been exposed and are mounting an immune response. For millions on millions of vaccinations, some will have a rough time and some a small reaction - and some, none whatsoever. 

Personally, I don't ""vax-shame"" any young healthy person who is willing to take other sensible precautions. Just don't make strangers or your own grandparents huff your breath. 

But also, don't let a vocal minority drive your decision. The math tilts toward vaccination being safer than infection.",nftyno,2021-05-19 14:40:14
"From someone who found this post via all, I‚Äôd say get it. Myself and all my family and friends have already gotten both doses and I‚Äôve not heard or experienced anything outside the usual. Your arm is going to hurt, you might feel shitty the day after you get it. The second dose will likely have slightly worse side effects than the first. All-in-all, it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal, and they only lasted a day. 

The CDC has a program you can enroll in after you get the shot called vsafe. They will text you daily and ask a few short questions about how you‚Äôre doing. If you report anything they find concerning, they‚Äôll give you a call. I felt better knowing they were seeing what I was reporting and that I was helping with safety data collection in aggregate. 

Good luck with your decision.",nftyno,2021-05-19 04:04:01
"Ask your DOCTOR or follow your local health authority's suggestions- not Reddit's.

"I'm going to wait if i even do decide to get it. But i know a lot of people that have had it, a few got really sick but most were just a little fatigued, lethargic for a day or two. The ones that got really sick had contracted covid around a month before receiving. I don't think a healthy 27 year old would have any bad side effects. My 67 year old dad had no negative reaction other than a little soreness at the spot of the injection which is normal for almost any shot.

Not wanting to encourage or discourage, just want to share what my friends, family and coworkers have experienced. I'm just not comfortable yet but am happy for people that are and receive it especially when they have little to no side effects. Cheers!!",nftyno,2021-05-19 22:02:10
"Do as much research as you can about all of the types of vaccines available to you, Pfizer, moderna, J&J, AstraZeneca. Research the side effects and benefits. Knowledge is very powerful and with that only you can make the best decision for yourself.",nftyno,2021-05-19 04:31:03

"Same here, however I got mine, yea they haven't figured out really what side effect for everyone, but I figured, its 2020-21, technology is way way better than back in the day. I mean just look around you, even your phone, bet your phone knows what you're about to type before you finish huh lol.  What used to take months take hours now, I know its scary but some protection is better than no protection at all",nftyno,2021-05-19 05:15:53
"I was in your shoes a few weeks ago. I thought it would be fine getting the shot as I am reasonably healthy (also 27) and wanted to do the right thing. I did feel sick on the 3rd day after the first shot and it scared me enough that I didn't know if I wanted to get the second. I talked with my doctor though and decided to get it. I personally knew I would feel too guilty if I didn't have a good reason to skip on it. I did get sick again for 2 days and then I was fine. 

Somethings to keep in mind with this is 1. There are way more people posting on here about bad experiences than good. People tend to not say anything when they have a good experience. 2. There are millions of people getting the shot. Only a tiny percent of those people are posting on here and they are mainly here to complain and condemn. 3. Some of these side effects might be unrelated to the shot. My ear started hurting 3-4 weeks ago (which was a few days before my second shot). My mind immediately jumped to ""oh god it's from the shot"". But, reasoning through it, I figured it might just be bad allergies and not get too paranoid. Went to the doctor today and he verified that my tubes were plugged up probably from allergies. Just because someone randomly feels weird or something happens to them doesn't necessarily mean it's because of the shot. 4. Everyone's body is unique and different. It seems like the younger people get sicker from the shot because their immune systems are strong and active. I read that earlier and have personally know many people who have gotten it. Bizarrely, no one I know over 50 has had any side effects. 

You need to make the choice for yourself. There are risks one way or another.",nftyno,2021-05-20 04:23:10
"Indeed. I have a very positive first jab experience but haven't posted anything yet (I wanted to wait until the second jab before sharing).

I'm not discrediting people who genuinely want to share their experience, be it positive or negative because both are very valuable for the sake of transparency (I carefully read both), but people are more likely to engage in discussing the negative experience. Also, I've seen some users in this sub who commented on many posts with negative experience, but never on the posts with positive experience. This may contribute to the highlights on the negative experience only.",nftyno,2021-05-19 09:41:52
"Awesome you did vsafe! I did, too! It‚Äôs also how we‚Äôll get decent data about the side effects, so the more that do it the better.
