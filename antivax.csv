My dad got vaxxed and now my siblings and mom are freaking out,77,nphuna,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/nphuna/my_dad_got_vaxxed_and_now_my_siblings_and_mom_are/,44,"So my antivqx siblings and mom are freaking out right now cause my dad decided to go get his vaccine. They're in the camp of thinking that the actual vaccine harms people (like of course some have side effects) but what really shocked me is that they were acting as if he were gunna die saying g he's lived a good life and 50s good enough, like I'm sorry what the actual fuck is going though your mind to say something like that. 

I'm getting mine in about 2 weeks time (I'm excited but Holy fuck are they gunna be hounding me once I get it 😂). They're also of the belief that vaccine shedding is a real thing. I'm really trying to understand how people go through that process of suddenly not trusting the scientific evidence in their face, where do these baseless ideascome from? Is there any way to combat it to make them understand that although there are side effects (to virtually any medication) or are they to far gone to help?

I don't think I should have to justify my position on wanting to be vaccinated and I see not point in judging them if they choose not to. 

I personally think they're just fearful of it mainly thrust on them from all these YouTube videos from fake professionals and stuff. 

But if anyone has any suggestions or ways to discuss their claims from a civil standpoint it'd be must appreciated !!",1622537561.0,2021-06-01 01:52:41

How I overcame my vaccine hesitancy,4,npnaol,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/npnaol/how_i_overcame_my_vaccine_hesitancy/,31,"A year ago, I was very disinclined to take a covid-19 vaccine should one become available. Now, I've had my first dose and I'm planning to get my second.

In this post, I describe how my thinking shifted over the past year. I write this in the hope that it may be useful to other hesitant people, and maybe even to policymakers and communicators.


## About Me

I'm a young person living in Ontario, Canada, though I think the points in this post are broadly applicable, especially to young people.


## Part 1: The Hesitancy

I hold one group of people responsible for my hesitancy, and another for helping me overcome it.

I'll call the first group the ""establishment"". I'm including in it the political establishment (political leaders of most jurisdictions, including mine), the public health establishment (public health authorities of most jurisdictions, including mine), and the media establishment (the majority, though by no means all, of the commentators and experts who appear in mainstream media sources).

In other words, the people who determine the policy responses to the pandemic, and to a large extent the narratives and messaging around it in public discourse.

I've found the prevailing messaging about the pandemic to be very one-sided: all about the risks and dangers of covid-19, and fairly little about the risks and effects of the interventions taken against it.

As a young person, my risk of serious illness or death from covid-19 is very low. Yet, I've been asked to deprive myself of almost all in-person social contact, for (most of) what is now a period of 14 months and counting. Many young people have had their educations interrupted, or replaced with inferior online options. Many others lost their jobs and faced evictions and economic precarity.

And compounding all this was the moralizing attitude that pervaded the establishment narratives. Not only were we asked to cut out in-person social contact, we were asked as if that were _no big deal_. When we failed to completely suppress our fundamental human need for being with other people, we were called ""grandma killers"", or ""the people responsible for dragging this on"".

In some circles, if you didn't signal your virtue by emphasizing that every interaction you've had with another person has been virtual, and that you don't even go to the grocery store but get your groceries delivered (never mind that it's a _person_ who has to deliver it to you, doing the rounds in two hundred condo building corridors over the course of her day), you were considered part of the problem.

""Two weeks to flatten the curve"", they told us. But the message didn't change from the first two weeks, to the twentieth two weeks.

I didn't feel like what the establishment was asking of me was reasonable and proportionate, and I didn't feel like it was in my best interests.

I _resented_ being asked to make these sacrifices for the benefit of society, and as a result felt resentment and mistrust towards the establishment.

(Perhaps you, the reader, judge me for that. Perhaps you think I'm selfish and should instead meet society's needs with humility and grace rather than resentment. Maybe you're right. But that doesn't change the reality that there are people who think and feel as I do -- perhaps more than you might think -- and getting through to such people requires a change in approach, a change in messaging.)

What does this have to do with vaccine hesitancy? Simply that it was the same establishment -- that I distrusted and resented -- that was now asking me to get vaccinated.

If I felt that _one thing_ the establishment was asking of me (subjecting myself to strict lockdown measures) was not in my best interests, why would I trust that _another thing_ they were asking of me (getting vaccinated) was?


## Part 2: The Overcoming

Being so disillusioned with mainstream narratives, and feeling like the establishment was not a place for me to look to for sympathy or understanding, I started to look elsewhere.

I found the sympathy and understanding I was looking for from a group of people I started to follow on Twitter. Some of them were doctors (some even epidemiologists), others were lay commentators.

This group of people had a somewhat different perspective on the pandemic. They recognized that the pandemic and the responses to it created a _variety_ of challenges for people: the risk of illness and death from covid-19, but also social isolation, economic hardship, and many others. They showed _empathy_ to people facing any of these challenges.

To borrow a memorable turn of phrase employed by one member of this group, they did not subscribe to the [monomania](https://twitter.com/bergerbell/status/1362527692571119618) that afflicted the establishment, whereby all aspects of how we organize our society revolve around one consideration -- the risk of covid-19 -- to the exclusion of all others.

I want to be very clear: these people were **not** covid denialists or conspiracy theorists of any sort. The doctors among them were respected experts at major universities. They did not dispute the scientific consensus about questions like how covid-19 is transmitted or what its fatality rate is or whether PCR tests work. They just held a minority view about the **policy** aspects of our pandemic response, such as whether extended strict lockdowns were a proportionate intervention, or whether the benefits of school closures outweighed their harms to children.

These folks advocated for a _harm reduction_ approach to covid safety, rather than an _abstinence-only_ approach. They recognized that human beings have needs, and over a period of multiple months, some people _are_ going to meet up from time to time. They never once passed judgment or engaged in moralizing. They gave us the best scientific information available about the risks of various activities -- explaining, for example, how much safer the outdoors was than the indoors, and why -- and left it to us to use that information to make reasoned decisions about our behaviour. They treated us like the human beings possessing agency and autonomy that we are.

In these people, I found something I lacked when listening only to establishment voices. I found a perspective that didn't make me want to tear my hair out. I found values that I could identify with. I found guidance that I felt I could trust.

And now, we come to the crucial part: **this group, too, was enthusiastically pro-vaccine**.

The same message -- ""get vaccinated"" -- that meant next to nothing coming from the group I resented (the establishment), became trustworthy and valuable advice coming from this group of people I've come to trust.

Rather than sternly warning us that even after vaccination, we'd have to continue to socially distance until some nebulous unspecified time in the future -- which was the main message we heard from the establishment -- this group reassured us that vaccination is our way out of this pandemic, and that it was safe for vaccinated groups of people to do pretty much anything they could do pre-pandemic.

(They also advocated for recognition of this fact by establishment institutions, and were in some cases successful. When, on May 13 2021, the U.S. CDC finally announced that vaccinated people did not, in fact, have to socially distance from each other, that was in part thanks to the efforts of some members of this group to raise awareness about the accumulating evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines at stopping transmission.)

When we had concerns about vaccine side effects, people in this group were generous in taking the time to share their expertise, point us to the latest available accurate information, and help allay our concerns. When reports of rare but serious side effects emerged, such as about the AstraZeneca vaccine causing rare blood clots (""VITT""), they didn't lecture us about how the risk of covid was surely higher. Rather, they recognized that VITT was indeed a scary outcome, and that if we felt more comfortable waiting a few weeks for an mRNA vaccine, that was a perfectly understandable personal choice. (Establishment guidance caught up here too, with AstraZeneca being discontinued for first doses just a few weeks later.)

This group of people helped me get over the fence, from being wholly uncertain that getting a covid-19 vaccine would be in my best interests, to being quite convinced that it was.

I won't list everyone I consider to be in this group, but I'll call out one person who stands out: [Dr. Monica Gandhi](https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9), an infectious diseases doctor at UCSF. I have nothing but admiration and deep gratitude for her. If you want to be part of an online community engaging in empathetic, optimistic, and empowering pandemic discourse, start by following her.


## Part 3: The Takeaways

Here's my theory for how most people who get entrenched in vaccine hesitancy come to hold their beliefs:

  1. Like me (and maybe for similar reasons), they feel disillusioned by the establishment.
  2. Like me, they search for other communities and sources of guidance and advice.
  3. Rather than encountering the group of people that I did, they encounter a different group -- people who are not only skeptical of the policy responses to the pandemic, but who also question the scientific consensus, and allege conspiracies and cover-ups at various institutional levels.
  4. They come to trust this group, because the narratives they offer are more comforting than the ones on offer from the establishment.
  5. This group advises them to be skeptical of and reject vaccines (I guess because that fits well with their conspiracy theorizing).

Most current efforts to combat vaccine hesitancy seem to focus on intervening at step (3) of this process -- banning the misinformation purveyors from social media, that sort of thing. We can debate how effective that is likely to be. (I'm personally skeptical that ramping up on censorship would foster trust in the establishment, but that's a topic for another time.)

But what if we intervened at step (1) instead? What if our establishment institutions engaged in the sort of messaging that fosters trust, so people didn't _feel the need_ to look elsehwere in the first place?

I'm not suggesting that authorities simply tell people what they want to hear. (I recognize the dangers of that, as e.g. when some scientists mistakenly claimed early in the pandemic that we were already close to herd immunity. We may have really wanted to believe that, but it wasn't the case.) Accurate, evidence-based information is key.

But there _is_ room to craft guidance and frame discourse in a more balanced, less one-sided way. To replace the shaming and the moralizing with universal compassion and empathy, towards the effects of disease _and_ the effects of interventions. To recognize that after 14 months of isolation, there is a limit to what you can reasonably expect from people, and what tradeoffs people are willing to make for public health. To acknowledge that people desperately need an endgame to this pandemic, to message such an endgame, and to make clear the vital role vaccines play in it.

A few subtle but important changes to our approach could go a long way towards putting a dent in vaccine hesitancy.",1622556911.0,2021-06-01 07:15:11
Question About Anti-Vaxxers Claims About CDC Data and MMR/Autism Relationship?,1,npjojv,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/npjojv/question_about_antivaxxers_claims_about_cdc_data/,9,"A  few people I know have watched the documentary ""Vaxxed."" Normally when  discussing vaccine conspiracy theories, I cite data to counter the BS.  For example, how no studies (aside from Wakefield's ""study"") have found a  correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism.

The  documentary makes the claim that all studies on the MMR/Autism  correlation rely upon CDC data (I think a specific data set from 2004)  and that the CDC omitted or erased data suggesting correlations—which  was later ostensibly ""revealed"" by Brian Hooker and an insider Dr. William Thompson.

It's  impossible to argue with an anti-vaxxer about whether or not the CDC  covered up data or not. What I want to know is if it is true that all  the heretofore studies on this topic have relied on CDC data. I find  this hard to believe? What about abroad? Have other studies relied on  other data sets or collected their own? Knowing this provides a good  counterpoint to this claim so I'd like to know (plus I'm interested in  learning more in general).",1622543659.0,2021-06-01 03:34:19

1.Proper vaccines take years of work And the vaccine has only been tested for 1 almost 2 years now. 

2.I take medicine because medicine dates back a really long time and I feel safer with that.

No hate please or downvotes as I would like to understand your viewpoint too.

My parents' psychological terrorism is making me sleepless,3,ni4220,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/ni4220/my_parents_psychological_terrorism_is_making_me/,5,"It all started because I revealed to my mom I will take the Covid vaccine once available. They keep sending me random PubMed articles about magnetogenetics (which is a whole other thing but there's a conspiracy going around that vaccines are magnetic so this is they closest they can get to scientifically justifying it I guess), and every single time something happens to someone who had the vaccine, they'll make sure I know. Relative with stroke three days after the vaccine, I have to know. Friend with a very swollen arm after the vaccine (lymphnodes affected they say), I have to know. Any death after the vaccine they read about online, I have to know.  


They tell me the vaccine hub won't accept any side effect report and I won't get help if things go wrong, and tell me stories from friends about it. They also make sure I know that ""if you take the vaccine you will be alone, we wouldn't be able to help you if something very bad happened because of it, and none of your friends would either"". My mom knows I'm doing it because I want to keep my community safe in university. She also said ""if you think vaccines work to protect others, you're very wrong"". If I didn't know better I'd think I'm taking this decision only to permanently harm myself. There's a person in my family who developed epilepsy after the HPV vaccine, so even though I won't change my mind on this, I'm very very scared and know that I can't be able to count on anyone from my family, and can only hope they're wrong about my friends not helping if something happens. It is really hard to override whatever they're trying to do here and it's making a number on me.  


The only other person I've talked about this with told me I should send them to jail, and even got angry once I told them that's way too far and thinking about my parents in jail would not help emotionally in any way. I'm not showing it in my social life but it's affecting me to the point where it is hard to sleep. I feel isolated and am afraid this is exactly what they want, even if not consciously so. I've already contacted my psychologist, but will see her once a week. What can I do in the meanwhile to alleviate all of this?",1621663325.0,2021-05-21 23:02:05

Is asking a person if they are vaccinated considered personal information when this pandemic affects the entire planet?,1,ngukho,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/ngukho/is_asking_a_person_if_they_are_vaccinated/,6,"Okay, so I am in a bit of a tough situation. I've been seeing this one therapist for about 5 months now and also have a case worker who comes to my apartment about every three weeks. However, something both of them recently said kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

First, I told my case worker I got set up for my first Covid vaccine. Then I asked her if she had gotten her vaccine yet. She told me that she doesn't plan on getting it because ""it's still new and I don't think that's something I need right now"". She even told me she knows it's 95% effective, yet she is still refusing to take it. She travels around the community and goes in and out of her clients' homes all day every weekday... So she is basically a potential vessel for Covid to spread. Because of this, she should get the vaccine immediately, but she refuses, which is a big concern.

Now onto the main reason I made this post. I asked my therapist the same question. And she told me ""that's personal information that I do not wish to disclose to anyone"". Which leads me to believe she has also chosen to not get vaccinated. There is another big problem with her statement though... This pandemic affects everyone on the planet, so how could that possibly be personal information? If she were to be asymptomatic with Covid, come into work, spread it to her clients and staff members, and one of those people died from Covid because she gave them Covid, now that wouldn't be so personal anymore, don't you think? I can understand a question like ""What is your husband's name?"" or ""What do you like to do for fun?"" being considered personal questions. But when this deadly virus is spreading across the globe and could potentially be given to me or someone else from coming in contact with you, why would that be something you would want to withhold from me? Also, if I can't trust these people to get vaccinated, which they are refusing to get vaccinated/refusing to tell me if they did or not, then why the hell should I trust them with handling my mental health? This is an honest question. Am I crazy or are my concerns reasonable?",1621527779.0,2021-05-20 09:22:59

I recently saw a compilation of 15+ people showing strong magnets sticking to their arms shortly after they got COVID vaccines. I trust the authenticity of these videos, and don't believe them to be staged. If you can trust me on that, I'll ask my question. 

The videos were completely removed from instagram minutes after they were posted, and the only explanation I can find online is shitty articles from Snopes and USA Today that use a straw man argument: they all answer the question ""Are The Vaccines Microchips?"". But I don't think microchips are being injected into our arms -- that's absurd for so many reasons. But I am quite troubled by the magnetism. Does anyone have an explanation as to why this is happening? And does it not bother any of you that the tech giants -- social media platforms and Google -- are censoring the living fuck out of any anti-vax messaging? If you even search ""anti vaccine"" on instagram, you won't get a single hashtag or account. I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but I am deeply troubled by this breach of free speech.

For starters, my mother has become the most anti-vax person i’ve ever met in person. I realized it when she was talking about how scary it is that we don’t know what they put in it and how there hasn’t been any research done and people have been dying left and right from it? I just shut up because I know she has some weird thoughts and I thought it would pass, but I realize I should’ve said something. 

She has become against all vaccines in general now saying that we can’t trust anything “they” want to put in our body’s. And now she has my step dad on her band wagon too, and that terrifies me because he just had a kid that is going to need vaccinations. 

My grandma recently got vaccinated and I told her that I needed her to take me to get mine because my mom was very against it and wouldn’t take me. Of course my grandma texted my mom to make sure it was okay that she took me and my mom went off. 

When my mom got off the phone, she and my dad both told me that if I was to get the vaccine they wouldn’t want to be around me and would force me to stay in my room for at least 2 weeks to basically quarantine and “make sure you don’t die”. I just wanted to cry. I’m 16 like really guys? You don’t want to be around your kid because he got vaccinated for a virus?

They went on and on about how “there’s gross stuff in the vaccine like aborted baby cells” and “we don’t know the long term affects” and “people are already dying of it.” 

Like okay I don’t know what’s in it, but shit obviously they are in it for a reason. I trust in science, I know science can be weird and gross and I won’t even pretend to not be grossed out by a lot of shit they could be using but to really be so ignorant to ignore the fact that some things just have to be made with certain proteins and cells because science- it’s just so surprising to me. 

And omg with the whole “people are dying from it.” She’s always trying to show me a story on the news and the headline is always along the lines of “Woman dies of -blank- after getting covid vaccination.” I just wanna look at her and tell her- people are dying every second, so many people die everyday from so many different things. You don’t think that maybe, just maybe they were probably gonna pass anyway and they just so happen to get the covid shot recently, because there’s so many people getting the shot right now. And the news companies just wanna push shit out and make money so they aren’t concerned about telling the truth or not.

It just kills me because I know they know that they’re wrong. They aren’t dumb people, they just got fed a lot of lies and can’t unlearn it.",1620751475.0,2021-05-11 09:44:35

I got vaccinated in January as part of an allied health clinical program. On the 5th I found out my program is requiring me to prove I have been vaccinated by uploading a photo of my card. I only have until the 11th and they claim anyone who doesn't submit proof in time will not be allowed to to precipitate in clinicals. This would be a set back of a full year. I didn't go in to try to get a duplicate card on Friday because I had to work. Now, I have to get a new card and submit it by the end of the day on Monday. I am going to go in and try to get a new one, but if they cant give it to me on the spot, I am considering  getting vaccinated a second time. is there any evidence that this might be unsafe?

Need help with vaccine how-to,21,n5qeok,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/n5qeok/need_help_with_vaccine_howto/,35,"Hi eveyone,

Dealing with an antivaxx mom has its ups and downs.

I am trying to break down the vaccine process as much as possible to explain it to her like she'd be five.

Here is what I understood so far:

Covid19 virus is composed by different  proteins whose the Spike protein, which is known for being the protein  which allows the virus to spread to healthy cells.

The purpose of the MRNA vaccine is to give “the recipe” of this spike  protein to our body to create some, so that when our body will recognize  this protein and notices that it has nothing to do here, it would  trigger the alert, and our immune system would fight against this protein to get rid of it.

The goal  here is that if our bodies comes across the covid virus, it would  recognize the spike protein and fight it, in order to get rid of it and avoid its spread to our whole body.

To  summarize, the vaccine is like a recipe of a part of the COVID in order  to introduce it to our immune system and fight it when we’ll be facing  “the real one”.

In order to prevent the future question, would someone be able to correct me if I am wrong in what I have written above?

Also, I am curious about the production of Spike proteins by our body. How many (If that's quantifiable) are created and for how long after one's getting the covid vaccine? 

I also found this article pointing out the danger of the Spike protein by itself:

[https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/](https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/)

I found these two quotations in it:

a) "" Scientists have known for a while that SARS-CoV-2’s distinctive “spike”  proteins help the virus infect its host by latching on to healthy cells.  Now, a major new study shows that the virus spike proteins (which  behave very differently than those safely encoded by vaccines) also play  a key role in the disease itself.""

b) ""In the new study, the researchers created a “pseudovirus” that was  surrounded by SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins, but did not  contain any actual virus. Exposure to this pseudovirus resulted in  damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model—proving that the  spike protein alone was enough to cause disease. Tissue samples showed  inflammation in endothelial cells lining the pulmonary artery walls.""

My question with the A quote is: How is the spike protein ""safely encoded""?

With the B quote: Is there a difference between the covid virus Spike protein and the one we are teaching to our immune system?

Again, sorry for the long post and for my non-existing background in biology, really trying to make a point with some loved ones who don't realize the risks they are taking,

\-We have been given immunity for a reason. And the old / sick people should stay home, eat healthy and build antibodies and not just take a shot, thinking everything is going away.

So. Basically. We may have a brief period where these lunatics briefly mask up and help us get to herd immunity...but, after we actually GET herd immunity and there's no virus threat, we may actually have the people who refused to mask and stay home quite literally hiding in their houses and walking around in masks and near hazmat suits because they're terrified vaccinated people are going to infect them.

I live in a country where the only available COVID vaccine (currently) is the AstraZeneca vaccine. Unfortunately, because of all the sensationalism surrounding the potential link between this vaccine and the occurrence of blood clots, I'm the only person in my department that is willing to receive the vaccine when it becomes available to people below 60.

From what I can tell, the chances of these blood clots occuring (at least in the UK) is somewhere between 1-4 in 1 million, though I could not find any definitive studies that rule out or otherwise account for the usual occurrence of blood clots in the population, so that's what I'm working with.

That said, do you all have any advice for convincing people that it's in their and other people's interests to get vaccinated. Keep in mind that these are mostly office co-workers, so I can't afford to be too pushy or be seen as stirring up trouble.

The sheer volume and intensity of the screaming & the panic in her eyes at being hurt made me understand for the first time why a parent wouldn't want to vaccinate their child. Those three needle pricks comprise the worst pain she has felt in her life. The rest of the day, she cried and screamed until she was given pain relievers. I understand how you could look into your child’s eyes and not want to put them through immediate pain to stave off some seemingly far away disease. 

That's where logic takes over, and I know that my child must be vaccinated, and that she won't remember this pain, and that she knows that she is loved abundantly. It is easy to empathize with those parents who maybe don't hold science in such high esteem.

My professional background assists me in this endeavor as I have a pretty solid understanding of the scientific method and statistical analysis, I now want to see if I can take those skills and apply them to any opposing studies the antivax community uses to push their agenda.

The challenge I am facing is that it seems to be pretty hard to find such information. I am aware of the Andrew Wakefield paper and have read it, but I am interested in finding some more modern day sources on the matter. A cursory web search regarding antivax literature mostly turns up articles that refute the claims of the antivax stance. This is great and all as bold antivax claims that hold little merit should not be more visible than factual information, but it is challenging to find even a small tidbit of pro antivax information. I am personally not very knowledgeable with online antivax communities so I don't know of any forums or blogs I could scour for sources.

They are willing to risk deadly yet avoidable diseases as opposed to ""risking"" a mental disorder that has been proven time and time again, scientifically, to not be linked to vaccines in any meaningful way. In their heads, Autism is a curse worse than the Plagues of Egypt.

What's wrong with this reasoning?,10,mb7921,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/mb7921/whats_wrong_with_this_reasoning/,9,"Someone posted this recently can someone articulate what's wrong with what they're saying (I know its bull already)

&nbsp;

""I've seen a lot of posts indicating that people believe the mRNA shot makes it 95% less likely that you'll get covid. I realize people have all sorts of reasons for wanting to get the shot, but they should take this one out of the equation, because it's completely untrue.

&nbsp;
Here's an explanation of how Pfizer claimed that Lipitor reduced heart attacks by 36%, when it was really just a 1% decrease compared to the placebo group:
The ad reads: In patients with multiple risk factors for heart disease, LIPITOR REDUCES RISK OF HEART ATTACK BY 36%.* The noteworthy part of this ad is the asterisk and this explanation of the 36 percent statistic: “That means, in a large clinical study, 3% of patients taking a sugar pill or placebo had a heart attack compared to 2% of patients taking Lipitor.”

&nbsp;

http://haydeninstitute.com/.../pfizer-ads-come-clean...
https://www.lewrockwell.com/assets/2016/07/122.png
So Lipitor only reduced heart attacks among study participants by 1%. And Pfizer made billions upon billions for that slight improvement (IF they were honest about the rest of the study and there actually WAS improvement in the medicated group).
The funny thing is, the day before I saw that Lipitor explanation in a video (not at all related to covid), I had looked at the covid mRNA injection study and found they had done this exact thing.
162/20,244 in the placebo group got covid during study period
8/20,033 in the vaccinated group got covid during study period
So in the placebo group, 99.19% did NOT get covid
And in the vaccinated group, 99.96% did NOT get covid
There was a difference of less than 1% in the infection rate between the two groups (p. 24).
https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download
It's absolutely crazy that they are allowed to completely ignore the denominator. (In other words, if 162 out of a billion placebos had gotten covid, and 8 out of a billion vaccinated had gotten covid, they could still claim a 95% efficacy rate with this kind of ""math."")""",1616504994.0,2021-03-23 06:09:54

Not even on Reddit. I'm  wondering, does anyone know,  has anyone published any research on this  possibility and what the results actually were?

I need advice on how to deal with a real antivax mother in law and my fiancee because I'm clueless.,11,m7oldw,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/m7oldw/i_need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_a_real_antivax/,3,"First let me give a little background.
My fiancee and I have been together for 7 years now, we don't live together yet but my girlfriend has her own place. We were planning to get married but it has been delayed a bit. We are both 24 years old. My mother in law has always been against vaccines but during the last year she also got into all kinds of conspiracy theories and is completely ""enlightened"" now. 

It's been a year since she talks non stop about all of her theories and arguing with her is, as you all may have guessed, impossible. Every fact is countered with nonsense and it's like arguing with an apple. So I gave up on that and just say ""oh that's crazy! Interesting."" 

The real problem started when she one day said to me that I'm not going to vaccine my children. I told her yes I am because I think it's the best thing to do. She bombarded me with facts about why it's bad and well I was not prepared to argue with her and have some useful information about why vaccines are good, even though 80% of her facts were once again nonsense. So I said that I didn't do much research about the ups and downs and once I get kids I will make sure to do that. 

I talked to my fiancee afterwards and told her that I actually want to vaccine my future kids and she told me she wasn't sure... and it took me by surprise. I knew my mother in law was like that but I had no clue my fiancee had doubts about it. We both agreed to do proper research before we get kids on this topic to come to an agreement. 

But since my mother in law is talking about all kinds of stuff all the time my fiancee is having doubts about certain things that in my opinion are bullshit. I'm afraid that she will slowly start believing more nonsense. She tells me it's her mother and it's hard for her to see everything as nonsense and that she thinks certain things make sense. 

The most anmoying thing is when I tell her certain things that are proven and true and she responds with ""hmm idk"" and that drives me nuts. She believes facts her mom picks from facebook but not things I show her with proof. 

I'm so clueless and I don't know what to do or who to talk to so I was just hoping you guys could give me some reassurance or some advice or anything. 

Other than this my fiancee and mother in law are both great persons and I love them and we get along so good.",1616095047.0,2021-03-18 12:17:27

Not sure if this is the right place so please point me in the right direction if it isn't. 

Backstory: my daughter has a tongue tie that could potentially give her a lisp but wouldn't change anything else. She's 3 in a couple months and her speech is coming along great.

So I was in a bar/restaurant with my toddler and fiance, and I saw a woman on another table who started asking me questions about my daughter. 
She asked if my daughter could talk, and I said she could a little but her tongue tie could potentially make things a little more difficult for her, as it can restrict the tongue.

She asked me why I hadn't cut it out and that I should definitely get it done because my daughter might be bullied for having a lisp. I said I found it difficult to sit through my daughter's vaccinations with how they make her cry, I don't want to do anything that isn't 100% necessary. (I know I'm a wimp but I get everything necessary done).

You know, theres families that has been affected by some of these vaccines. People have died.. They all deserve to  to warn others of the potential side effects. Just because it hasent happened to you, doesnt mean that your opinion is valid. Learn how to be more open minded and hear others out. You're not always right in life, as much as you think you are lol. 
Can someone answer this.. what would be the main objective if everyone knowingly was spreading the misinformation? What would be the purpose to that? What is the ""anti-vaxxers"" motive? 
Question for the ""pro-vaxxers"". Why do most of you guys think vaccines are our only hope? Why doesnt anyone mention natural remedies or just any methods to non pharmaceutical medicines? Shouldnt we be doing everything we can to be healthy. I have friends who are up to date on all of their shots, and they are sick quite more often than I am. Just interesting. Because logic tells me that their immune system should better protect them from sicknessess right? 
Also, stop assuming peoples intelligence based from what they believe. That is foolishness in itself. Hopefully this post will atleast make you consider what I'm saying. If not, atleast i got a rise out of yous.

This document is ***215*** pages long (sorry about that)  with pages #1 - 10 dedicated to 50+ studies showing no link between vaccines and autism. The rest (pages #10 - 215) are dedicated to showing vaccines are safe, effective and immunogenic. Some of the studies in this section include [randomized control trials on a vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673617318214) and studies showing vaccines did not cause a particular adverse effect [such as SIDS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06008978) to name a few.

It should be noted that the list does not contain any studies pertaining to the Covid-19 vaccines. I do plan on adding those sometime in the future.

Vaccine choice,1,llzi6u,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/llzi6u/vaccine_choice/,20,"I have received both doses of Pfizer's COVID 19.

Back in 2009, I was offered the Anthrax vaccine before going to Iraq. I declined. I judged that there was virtual no chance that I would be exposed to Anthrax in circumstances where the vaccine would be beneficial. I was glad that I had the choice. My colleagues that worked for the Department of Defense didn’t have a choice.

All vaccines are not perfect. And this COVID19 (Pfizer) has had much less testing than any other vaccine I have received. But still, my judgment is the risk is worth it. There should be an individual risk/benefit analysis for all people for all medical treatments. People should not be shamed or ridiculed for asking questions and making their own decisions. Vaccines are like a reverse lottery, there are millions and millions of winners and only a handful of losers. But no one should be forced to take the chance, regardless of the odds.

Vaccine absolutists like to bring up ‘herd immunity’. But there doesn’t seem to be any scientific consensus as to what rate is need for heard immunity. And some of the policy and statements by public health officials do not seem to be based on epidemiological science. 

As we start to consider vaccine ‘requirements’ as we go forward we should remember the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights- “Any preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic medical intervention is only to be carried out with the prior, free and informed consent of the person concerned.” We don’t force people to give blood or bone marrow. We can’t force people into a medical intervention with the justification that it will benefit someone else, like chasing herd immunity.

One small silver-lining of the COVID pandemic is that vaccination records will likely be required for entry into the United States in the future. This will almost completely eliminate the threat of measles in the USA. It always made more sense to take this step rather than trying to bully 100 million school children into getting measles vaccine. Particularly considering that much of the walking around adult population likely does not have effective immunity to measles.",1613611093.0,2021-02-17 17:18:13

A crossroad.,4,lgfmr6,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/lgfmr6/a_crossroad/,7,"This might get personal.

I am pro vaccine, I believe people should be immunized to protect the greater population from harmful diseases as well as themselves.

My mother is an odd case being she believes in the necessity of vaccines as I do, but with her It gets a bit trickier having a kid, (my brother) with autism.

Now the story for this is a bit tricky in my mind because it isn't as typical as one would expect.

Basically her story is my brother was a normal baby, easy pregnancy, responsive, audible ect. (fun fact: in comparison, being the first born, I almost died lol)

This went on for a few months, then a loose quote from her is ""he recieved around 5 shots in the span of 1 week and his behavior did a complete 180.""

""Communication"" was non existent, he was less responsive and a few weeks later he was diagnosed with Low functioning autism. 

Now i'd like to say i'm fairly educated when it comes to this subject. I've seen the countless articles and fact checks, but I couldn't give her an answer as to why this happened, and i'm still grappling with it now.

(Don't crucify me) The conversation ended when I said it was plausible that somehow the vaccines altered my brother's brain chemistry enough to cause something like this. This begs the question though, was it my brother's brain chemistry to begin with, just the vaccines or a combination of both. It's impossible to find out.

Ultimately it comes down to this, is it foolish to think vaccines could alter brain chemistry in ways like this (not just autism but a fundamental chemical change)
Or is this just a simple case of correlation is not causation.

Anti-covid-vaccine rebuttal found on Facebook - Translation help please!,0,l0bmlo,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/l0bmlo/anticovidvaccine_rebuttal_found_on_facebook/,2,"Could someone help me get a proper English version of the rebuttal I found on a coworker's facebook to a common anti-covid-vaccine message that's being spread?  Google translate probably won't convince the covidiots I have on my timeline...  I've seen this antivax message in several languages already (English, Dutch, German), but this is the first time I've seen a reply point by point. It includes Dutch/Belgian data, so any info on American/Australian/British/French data to replace it with would be appreciated.  


The (facebook translated) original text:

> Just read. ""If you still have doubts about whether you want to take that injection. Take a look at this. Questions to the government we should all be asking .... If I get vaccinated: 1. Can I stop wearing the mask? - No. 2. Can they reopen restaurants etc. and is everyone working normally? - No. 3. Am I resistant to covid? - Probably, but we're not sure, it may not prevent you from getting it 4. Am I at least no longer contagious to others? - No, you can still pass it on, maybe, nobody knows. 5. If we vaccinate all children, will the school function normally again? - No. 6. If I have been vaccinated, can I stop social distancing? - No. 7. If I have been vaccinated, can I stop disinfecting my hands? - No. 8. If I vaccinate myself and my family, can we hug each other? - No. 9. Will cinemas, theaters and stadiums reopen thanks to vaccines? - No. 10. Will the vaccinees be able to gather or congregate in large groups? - No. 11. What is the real benefit of vaccination? - The virus won't kill you. 12. Are you sure it won't kill me? - No. 13. If the virus statistically didn't kill me anyway ... Why should I get vaccinated? - To protect others. 14. So if I get vaccinated, are the others 100% sure I won't get them? - No. The vaccine does not provide immunity. Does not eliminate the virus. It does not prevent death. Doesn't guarantee you won't get it. It will not prevent you from getting it. It doesn't stop you from passing it on ... This does not eliminate the need for a travel ban. Does not obviate the need for masking. So ... why did we have to get vaccinated again? "" I rest my case 

The rebuttal a friend-of-a-friend posted: 

> So: still the same counter-arguments as against 1 of the first vaccines (smallpox)? 1 - masks will remain mandatory as long as this virus infects so many people (regardless of whether you are vaccinated or not - so probably LONGER if more people refuse the vaccine) 2 - see 1. As long as there is no group immunity (at least 70 vaccinated, ideally even at least 85%), restaurants remain closed. 3 - No scientist worthy of his title will answer ""yes"" to this. Viruses mutate. Most vaccines do not protect for life. ""Probably"" to a scientist = 99% sure. 4 - True for most vaccines. You most likely will not get sick yourself, but you may be a carrier of a virus (until your prepared immune system completely destroys it - which will be much faster than in an unvaccinated person) 5 - This vaccine is NOT administered to children, because it has not been tested on children, so the question is meaningless anyway. Better to just keep the schools open so the virus can run uninhibited, right? / s 6 - without vaccine: certainly not. 7 - without vaccine: no. 8 - without vaccine: no. 9 - without vaccine: no. If this lasts long enough, most might go out of business. 10 - no vaccine either. 11 - better resistance to this virus. It becomes less likely that the virus will not kill you and less likely that you will become seriously ill from this virus. 12 - No. Viruses mutate. Even with a vaccine, there is a chance that you will encounter a form against which you do not have sufficient resistance. However, that chance is many times greater if you have not been vaccinated. 13 - So you don't care about weaker / older people? You don't care about an extra 15,000 people who die in the Netherlands compared to a ""normal"" year (or an extra 16,000 in Belgium)? ""Surely they would have died?"" Nice when it's nobody you care about ... 14 - No. A scientist worthy of his title is rarely 100% certain. One of the driving forces in science is questioning EVERYTHING. If you do not want a vaccine and (partly) because of this, the chance is much greater that you will also infect others ... The vaccine provides (imperfect) immunity against known forms of the virus. Does not eliminate the virus, but can certainly slow it down (look at measles, for example, rarely fatal except in areas where vaccinations are NOT taking place) Doesn't Prevent Death - Heart disease and cancer remain the leading cause of death worldwide. Doesn't guarantee you won't get it - but just like the flu, you're more likely to get a mild form only. It doesn't stop you from passing it on ... but because the chances of getting it are smaller, and the likelihood of having an efficient immune response, the chances of passing it on are many times smaller! This does not remove the need for a travel ban - but it gives hope for the future. Do not obviate the need for masking - in many Asian countries, even when one has a simple cold, one wears a mask so as not to infect others. Are we really so selfish here that we only think about our own comfort? So .... Why shouldn't we get vaccinated? 

Copy/pasting seems to have messed up formatting (each point had its own line both in ""argument"" and rebuttal  on facebook) , but I hope to find a better (maybe original) English version of this than Google Translate can provide.  Except for some Dutch religious nutcakes, most of my friends who are against the vaccine seem to be American...",1611057386.0,2021-01-19 03:56:26
I was a viral anti-vaxxer who dressed as the measles & now I’m pro vax,359,kz7wx3,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/kz7wx3/i_was_a_viral_antivaxxer_who_dressed_as_the/,53,"Hi. I'm Heather Simpson. You probably don't know who I am, because I am a nobody to most people. But back in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, I was a viral anti-vaccine ""influencer."" Let me explain.

I was fully vaccinated as a child. In 2011 I barely poked myself with antique jewelery and I ran to my doctor's office to get a tetanus shot. I was pro vaccine because I was raised to be. My parents are awesome.

And then one day....fear crept in. It came in the form of an advertisement dedicated to an anti-vaccine documentary series. My husband and I wanted kids, and I knew this subject was important, so I caved and dumped $200 into the series. 😳

The series, as you can imagine, described how vaccines are linked to almost every single bad condition you can think of. And, as a young woman preparing to enter motherhood, I didn't know any better. They fed me fear and I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was, from that point on, convinced that vaccines could and would cause autism, SIDS, autoimmune diseases, and death in general.

I continued to study anti vaccine theories. You can find anything you want to support your claim, if only you set your mind to it. And boy did I find some things. I mostly found an abundance of fear based stories that terrified me. I decided I was never letting a vaccine near my child or I. 

Ever.

When my child was born in 2017, we gave her the vitamin k shot (which I was scolded by some anti-vaxxers for, and was told it caused her to have health issues) and we opted to give her no vaccines. I was confident in our decision, and so was my husband.

When she was about 18 months old, or the Winter of 2019, I started posting on Facebook about my vaccine hesitancy. To be honest, that was a lie, as I was not ""hesitant""...I KNEW I didn't like vaccines. But I figured looking ""hesitant"" would make me seem less crazy. When I first posted my views and hesitations on vaccines, my post got shared several hundred times.

I was shocked. Friend requests started pouring in. I didn't know what was happening. So I kept posting my views on vaccines, people kept sharing my posts, and my audience grew. It was wild and completely unexpected. I had no idea that this world of anti-vaccine moms and dads existed on social media.

They were so supportive and I made life long friends that I will always treasure. This whole experience was worth it if not just for the friends I made.

Fast forward to October of 2019 when I dressed as the measles because I was ""trying to think of the least scary thing I could be for Halloween."" Yall, I am taking this moment to openly tell you I was the worst. 

The. Actual. Worst.

It didn’t even look like measles. It looked like syphilis.

And then it went viral. Like, real viral.

It blew up on both Facebook and Reddit, and several national news oulets picked it up. I got death threats and people begged me to kill myself. It was bad. I did it to myself and I should never have dressed as something so heartless, but it was bad. I was shaken up quite a bit.

A few months later, however, Febraury of 2020 arrived. I started to feel different about things. I was relying on western medicine to treat my endometriosis, I had just had surgery, and had been studying vaccines from a different standpoint. I started to soften my anti-vax views. But when I posted about this softening of my views, a lot of the anti-vax crowd lost it on me. They were furious and just plain cruel. 

It was then that I realized a lot of them are very cult-like, because they will cast you out if you don't have an identical belief system as them. Don't get me wrong, there are MANY of them that are not this way, in whom I love and adore. But a LOT of them are militant about their anti-vax beliefs. They claim to be ""pro medical freedom"" but will tear you apart if you choose a different medical decision than them. 

They bullied me so hard that I ended up in the ER with a panic attack. It was one of the worst weeks of my life....all because I was softening my views on vaccines. 

And then they ""cancelled"" me. Ohhhh, that online cancel culture. Gotta love it. 

But, if I'm being honest, it turned out to be one of the biggest blessings. Because I then had time to read, think, study and grow on my own without the ""group think"" influencing me.

And here I am now, planning to get my flu shot next week. I will also be getting my COVID vaccine. We will also be following our pediatrician's recommended vaccine schedule for our toddler. (I will not be discussing details as it is her private medical record.)

HOW DID I GET HERE?! 

That's really why you're reading this article, after all. So, allow me to explain the magic that happened in those months of studying after being “cancelled.”

First of all, when approaching an anti-vaxxer, you have to realize that there are usually three types. Typically, one is a conspiracy theorist, one is scared, and one is an ex-vaxxer. Sometimes they are all three. Sometimes they are none of these. Each person is unique, but these are the three categories I’ve typically observed. Depending on what catergory they fall into is going to help you to know how to approach then.

My category? I was scared. Terrified. I did not want to inject something into my child if I thought it was going to kill her. I wanted to protect my baby with my life. This is most anti-vaxxers I know. They are fiercely protective of their children, just like pro-vaxxers, and only want to keep them safe. 

And, to clarify, this is not a bad person versus good person debate. There are incredible parents on both sides. 

But I digress. I kept reading horrifying anecdotes from moms who would say that their baby died the day after vaccines. Or that their baby stopped talking the week later. Or that their baby stopped walking the month after. 

What finally caused me to start to question my anti-vax beliefs was when I started digging into each of these anectdotes to find the real truth, instead of blindly trusting stories. I found some of them to be true, definitely. But...I started to see that a lot of the ""vaccine deaths"" were actually due to co-sleeping accidents or other underlying conditions. The timing was just very, very unfortunate. The whole situation was sad. But vaccines inevitably took the blame. 

And sometimes the vaccine DID cause the baby's death or disability. Vaccines have never claimed to be 100% safe. Sometimes your baby is one of the rare statistics. Which makes it even harder to have discernment when reading anecdotes and trying not to be overcome with fear.

I got to a point where I was so engulfed in every anecdote, that I lost my ability to critically think about a situation past my emotions. I would read a story, feel sick to my stomach, and swear to never vaccinate my child.

But the problem is, anectdotes without proof can get out of hand quickly in the hands of social media. Susie could have broken her leg on the swingset the day after her tetanus shot, but the way Susie's mom told it on social media was that Susie got her shot, and now she can't walk. Then this post gets spread 20,000 times. You now have a bunch of parents not wanting their child to get the tetanus shot because of COURSE they don't want to risk their child losing their ability to walk.

I was told that my child's sleep apnea was due to her Vitamin K shot, and that her heart arrythmia was due to the vaccines I received in my childhood. If someone develops an autoimmune disease 15 years after their vaccines, some anti-vaxxers will still blame the vaccines. People need a reason explaining why they are sick. People need a reason their kid is sick. Vaccines are the perfect scapegoat, no matter how long it has been since they received them.

The next thing that started pulling me away from the anti-vaccine movement was VAERS. Also known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. There was something like 48,000 events registered in 2019 alone. But here's the deal: parents can report anything with no proof. Causation does not have to be established to make the list. 

For example, these are real documented events on VAERS:

Gunshot wound, fight in school, frostbite, infection of mites, electric shock from a hair straightener, drowning, damaged hair from incorrect hair bleach mixture, sunburn, tested positive for an STD, sports injury (dodge ball), sports injury (football), suicidal ideation due to breakup with boyfriend, murder, motor vehicle accident, and many, many more.

Some anti-vaxxers use VAERS as one of their strongest arguments, but as you can see, by doing this they are able to claim that a sunburn is a vaccine injury. Which, it's just...not.

The next thing I started studying, and again what many anti-vaxxers use in their arguments, is the vaccine package inserts. They use it as a ""gotcha"" argument. I used this argument too, and was very confident in it. 

The problem, however, is that the pacakage insert is a legal document, one that has to list any adverse event that occured subsequent to the vaccine or during clinical trials or post-marketing studies. No causal relationship has to be proven, but they legally have to list everything that happens. The Gardasil vaccine insert, for example, lists gunshot wounds, car wrecks, and suicide as an adverse event.

Next, I examined the ingredients. The ingredients were the biggest thing I was afraid of. 

Let's talk about aluminum, because mercury for the most part has been eliminated from vaccines and aluminum has stolen the spotlight. Babies receive about 10 mg of aluminum their first six months of life if they are breastfed, 30 mg if the are formula fed, and 120 milligrams if they are soy formula fed. But they only receive 4 mg of aluminum from vaccines in their first six months of life on the current vaccine schedule. 

I know. ""Injection is not the same ingestion."" But say 1% of the aluminum from tjhe formula is absorbed. We are still at .1 mg, .3 mg, and 1.2 mg....all stilll less than the 4 mg from vaccines.

Scientists have also done research that shows that the aluminum from vaccines does not raise the blood level of aluminum already in your system, and that the aluminum from vaccines exits so quickly that half of it is gone from your body by the next day.

The second scary ingredient I forced myself to examine is Formaldehyde. It is used to inactivate the viruses and bacteria in the vaccines. Because of that, you are going to end up with some formaldehyde in the final product. The amount of formaldehyde in a vaccine, not exceeding one tenth of a milligram, is considered safe, as you already naturally have formaldehyde in your circulation. Formaldehyde is required in humans for the synthesis of thymidine, purines, and amino acids-which are all necessary for the formation of DNA.

Everyone has detectible formaldehyde in their bloodstream, or about 2.5 micrograms per milliliter of blood. If you take an average weight of a 2 month old (11 pounds) with an average blood volume of 85 milliliters per kilogram, the total quanitity found naturally in that infant's blood would be about 1 milligram. 1 milligram of formaldehyde is ten times that which is in a vaccine. 

And for the third scary ingredient I examined, we have Polysorbate 80. Anti-vaxxers believe this chemical will open the blood brain barrier (BBB) up and allow aluminum to slip through into the brain. The problem with this, however, is that it is physically impossible for that to happen. But opening up the BBB is not as simple as it sounds. Assuming a vaccine contains 50 mcg (HPV vaccine, for example), a 10 pound baby would have to have dozens upon dozens of vaccines injected straight into its carotid artery to have even a CHANCE at opening up the BBB. Polysorbate 80 is also a very unstable chemical that gets attacked by esterases in your tissue at a very fast rate, and has a half life of 1.07 hours. (1,2)

But ultimately, what finally changed my mind, was having people reach out, listen to my fears, and talk to me. The thousands of mean comments didn't change my mind. In fact, those comments made me think I was even more in the right. If I had enemies, after all, then I must be doing something right. Those awful comments had the oppopsite effect of the pro vaccine person's intentions.

But when friends calmly and patiently explained the science to me, showing they cared more about me than about changing my mind, my mind started to open up to the fact that I could be wrong. That's when I started reading a book called ""The Vaccine Book"" by Dr. Robert Sears. He lays out information in a middle-ground sort of way. He seemed to be both pro and anti vax, with a very open mind and honest approach to both positions.  As I read, I started to realize that I trusted the doctor in this book, and that these vaccine injury posts on Facebook just did not line up to the number of vaccine injuries he stated had happened. 

But the final straw that broke the camel's back was when I was hospitalized due to bruising everywhere and endometriosis. The care I received from the medical team was amazing. The western medicine they gave me helped me so much. I realized many anti-vaxxers are anti-vax based on the theory that scientists and doctors are in on a conspiracy to kill or maim children for money. It dawned on me that I definitely don't believe that, and am not a conspiracy theorist at all. 

There is no way that thousands of doctors and scientists are out to kill or maim our kids. It's statistically impossible. Most of them are amazing people with huge hearts for kids. 

I want to apologize for anybody I hurt during my anti-vax days. I was harsh, sarcastic, and extremely hurtful. I know that there is a lot of ableism in the anti-vax movement, so just know this: your autistic child was born perfectly. Do not let anyone tell you that they need to be cured or fixed. I am so sorry if I ever promoted ableism. That was never my heart or intent, of course, but I am sorry if I did regardless. I would like to ask the pro vaccine and medical community's forgiveness for my flippant attitude, my Dunning Kruger effect that I put on like a a pair of shoes daily, and my measles costume that looked more like syphilis. I am so sorry. 

So, here I am. About to get my flu shot once I recover from a small case of pneumonia. Planning to trust doctors and scientists from here on out. Wish me luck on my journey-I am looking forward to seeing where it leads me.

"*SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN*, verified and established FACTS to immediately shut down the arguments of an uneducated anti-vaxxer. This post contains facts that will help you win any vaccine debate.",24,kwt73k,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/kwt73k/scientifically_proven_verified_and_established/,10,"This comprehensive and thorough list of facts will help you to counter and win any vaccine debate. If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:

\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**

\-One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)

\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**

\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported ""injury"" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**

\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.

\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported ""events"". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \*caused\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!

\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.

\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.

\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.

\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.

\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.

\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.

\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of ""conflict of interest"" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.

\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the “revolving door” phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.

\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.

\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

\-Autism is “more prevalent” due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50’s-80’s) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40’s and under).

Now with covid I’m terrified of having to get multiple shots to go back to a normal life. Right now I’m in the state of mind that I’m going to opt not to get it but I know in the back of my mind I should and that it will most likely be required to do things like travel and attend events.

Rant over it we are done,6,kp0jg7,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/kp0jg7/rant_over_it_we_are_done/,3,"Dear drug addict conspiritard former friend,

When you put out your opinion in a video that differed from my perception that was the nail in the coffin. I will no longer be abused verbally with rancid vomit and you thinking I’m wrong. I will not listen to a 41 year old grown man who lives with mom and dad delivering pizzas telling me how to live my life. I get my facts from history, books, family members in the healthcare industry who deal with ICU covid patients and not the mainstream news. 

How dare you think putting out your opinions on a video is justifying your “intelligence”? You are a drug addict who is a machine who has no empathy and is verbally abusive. There is no getting through to you about masks, there is no getting through to you about basic science and how vaccines work. 

You won’t change my mind about this, my mom almost died from tetanus, she almost died because she didn’t have a vaccine in close to 20 years. At the age of 14 I saw what happens when you don’t vaccinate. I saw my mother on the floor her muscles attacking her body, the excruciating pain she went through, what saved her was 16 shots of penicillin, modern medicine, a month in the hospital and 3 months on muscle relaxers. Let that sink into your head about not getting vaccines. 

You aren’t being unique and smart, you are the problem and finding people who believe your fringe beliefs is why we can’t have nice things. When you visited and had a two year old freak out outside the pub about a mask and two min of wearing it then we where going to go to the patio and drink our drinks without masks, you couldn’t do it. When you went off on me verbally assaulting my career choices, I have nothing to say to a 41 year old meth and heroin user with teeth falling out who delivers pizza for a living and lives with mom and dad. Your “ideas” are fkd up. How dare you put out a video to justify your shitlogic beliefs. I’m done. There is no getting through to you. You are what’s wrong with society. It would be better if you where not on this earth and I wish I had never met you. You will not be missed.

MMR vs. measles,62,knpv4r,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/knpv4r/mmr_vs_measles/,25,"Disclaimer: when I write 'MMR', I'm always referring to the MMR vaccine, not the 3 diseases (measles, mumps, rubella).

With measles being considered eliminated in the USA year 2000, people have soon lost their fear for this dangerous pathogen. Instead, another fear emerged: the fear of the MMR vaccine.

Vaccines have very much become the victims of their sheer brutal efficacy. This is indeed a dilemma: how do you balance the potential danger of measles against the immediate danger of MMR side effects?

# 1. **Measles is several thousand times as dangerous as MMR.**

Here are the serious complications of measles:

* ear infection which can lead to permanent hearing loss (1 in 14 cases) [1]
* pneumonia which can be fatal (1 in 16 cases) [2]
* encephalitis - brain inflammation which can lead to permanent brain damage and death (1 in 500-1000 cases) [2]

Here are the serious side effects of MMR:

* anaphylaxis - dangerous allergic reaction (1 in 900 000 cases) [3]
* encephalitis - brain inflammation which can lead to permanent brain damage and death (upwards of 1 in 1 000 000 cases) [2]

It takes basic mathematics to see that MMR is well, well worth it, even without pitting its side effects against other diseases it prevents: mups and rubella (which causes birth defects and foetal death). [4]

# 2. **We can't *not* have the side effects of MMR while also *not* having the deadly complications of measles.**

Yes, MMR can have nasty side effects. Yes, measles is no longer a real threat thanks to vaccination. But measles is likely the fastets spreading pathogen in history, with an R0 of about 12-18, while others report an even greater variation. This means that someone infected by measles can infect 12-18 other people. [5] As soon as vaccination drops below a threshold, measles will return. In fact, this is exactly what we are seeing in the USA. Imported cases of measles cause outbreaks which could have been prevented by vaccination. [6] If the rates keep falling, we might see a full-blown epidemic emerge. While countries such as USA still possess a high enough vaccination level to prevent this, WHO reports that more than 140 000 people have died from mesles worldwide in 2018, most of them being children under the age of 5. [7]

# 3. **The anti-vaccine movement threatens the most vulnerable ones.**

Through herd immunity, vaccines protect even those who can't receive them. MMR is a live vaccine, meaning immunocompromised people should not receive it. But with falling vaccination rates, we are risking letting down this protection, and giving up this protection.

**Conclusion**

If vaccination rates keep falling, we will likely see a resurgence of the diseases many of us had had the luxury to forget. No vaccine is 100% safe or effective, but their side effects are a small price to pay for the protection they offer to the society.

Got the Pfizer vaccine💉,73,kl70l0,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/kl70l0/got_the_pfizer_vaccine/,27,"Vaccine Facts (Pfizer):
1. It’s mRNA, not a small dose of COVID - The vaccine is basically sending a messenger to tell your body to produce proteins that will destroy COVID-19 as the virus tries to enter your body.

2. mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or 🧬 code.

3. It was tested on 44,000+ participants in a double blinded placebo study. Half of the patients received the vaccine, other half received the placebo. 

4. ~95% efficacy rate. Effective rate we’ll find in due time. The ~95% efficacy rate came from the results of the phase 3 trial in which 162 placebo recipients got infected with COVID-19 vs. the 8 vaccine recipients who got infected (out of 22,000+ participants from each group). If interested, DM me for the math to how pfizer got to ~95% efficacy with those numbers.

5. The vaccine is named BNT162b2 and will be given in 2💉💉 doses 21 days apart. Make sure to take the 2nd dose to achieve & maintain the ~95% efficacy rate. The first dose will prime your body to create the spike proteins needed to destroy the anatomy of the corona virus 🦠. The second dose will build the army of spike proteins to keep you protected. The length of time the 2 doses will protect against COVID-19 is to be determined. The participants from March 2020 are still protected at the ~95% efficacy rate, so it is promising.

Reasons why you don’t want the vaccine:
1. Speed of approval - this has been the fastest vaccine ever produced in the history of mankind. 
Ans: This is the 1st mRNA vaccine to be produced by intelligent scientists, doctors, and highly advanced technology. Speed doesn’t mean less efficient, we should realize how much science has advanced.

2. Long term effects - It is too soon to know the long term effects of this vaccine.
Ans: mRNA is fragile and will disintegrate in your body if you don’t keep it going. Every drug we take has side effects. Pfizer also makes viagra, a side effect being an inability to differentiate between the colors green and blue😯.

3. Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) - will the vaccine give me GBS?
Ans: There is no evidence to link GBS to the mRNA vaccine. The ratio of people who received the vaccine and have GBS is consistent with the yearly ratio of GBS incidence in the United States.

4. Government- Can’t trust them.
Ans: True. Especially for people of color, I totally understand. But we also have to focus on how many intellectuals🧠 and advancements in tech it took to bring forth this vaccine. I feel more comfortable when I think about the intellectuals. This vaccine would not be here if it wasn’t for them. Government=Politics and its understandable if they are not to be trusted. But intellectuals=science and it is amazing that we even have this vaccine available, Dr. Fauci approved😁.

5. 44,000 participants - is this enough to push the vaccine to the public?
Ans: Hats off to these brave people 🎩. Especially since they were double blinded with either the vaccine or placebo. There are a lot more people now who have taken the vaccine. Few have gotten anaphylactic shock, most had a sore arm. If side effects worry you, stop taking other drugs you take either by recreation or prescription🤷🏻‍♂️. 

Who shouldn’t take the vaccine:
1. If you’re under 16 yrs of age
2. If you have any allergies to the Pfizer vaccine components (see link below)
https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download 

Take with caution if:
1. You’re pregnant or planning to be pregnant
2. Have allergies to other vaccines
3. Take immunosuppressants or you are immunocompromised.
Of course speak with your doctor if you have concerning underlying medical conditions.

Don’t take the vaccine if you currently have COVID. If you had COVID or you are over the quarantine period, then yes - take the vaccine. Your antibodies will help you for only ~90days if you recovered from the virus, according to present studies. 

Why you should take the vaccine:

Benefits outweigh risks. Simple as that.

We are all probably desensitized by now but the deaths and infection rate is staggering (This is probably the only fact that has been consistent through our battle with this virus, consider all the changes with your hospital/CDC/media etc.)
Take a look: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
Patients are on multiple forms of life support, bleeding out from every orifice of their body, unable to breathe, unable to move due to fever and body aches. If you didn’t have someone you really loved in the hospital, you don’t know what it’s like. No visitors, maximum isolation, loneliness and delay of care is expected as we are all trying to protect ourselves from this microscopic organism. 
Woohoo for you if you were asymptomatic with COVID, you don’t know what long term effects it will have on you either.

With all said,
Do humanity a favor, take the vaccine.

Ps. Of course you can make you’re own decision, this is 🇺🇸:)

(Resource) Some common anti-vaccine arguments - and scientific responses to them,103,kl3gql,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/kl3gql/resource_some_common_antivaccine_arguments_and/,18,"The anti-vaccine side keeps repeating the exact same arguments which have been disproven countless times. Undoubtedly, once their arguments are depleted, the truth comes out: the anti-vaccine side does not argue with credible facts and statistics, but merely with anecdotes, pseudoscience and gut feeling. Still, I'm posting this here in hopes that some are willing to listen. If you can think of any other arguments, I shall do my best to implement them. Thank you for reading.

# 1. ""The decline in infectious diseases can not be attributed to vaccination, but to hygiene.""

This is an interesting argument because it's absolutely incorrect. It is true that modern hygiene and clean drinking water were both major contributors to current health. But they alone are not sufficient to explain the drastic decreases of infections. \[1\] For example, the variola virus causing smallpox was a major killer until the Eradication Program and its successor, the Intensified Eradication Program of the WHO. \[2\] Vaccination alone can explain the eradication of this deadly pathogen which is estimated to have caused a stunning 300 million deaths, all during the 20^(th) century. \[3\]

A more recent example is measles, considered eradicated in the USA in 2000. However, due to the falling vaccination rates, we are seeing a comeback of this dangerous pathogen. This would be entirely preventable by vaccination. Measles is unfortunately extremely contagious and so its return is very quick. \[4\] In this case, the anti-vaccine movement is literally saving deadly diseases from extinction. **If it was hygiene and not vaccines which holds diseases at bay, we would expect the resurgence of measles to be caused by decreased hygiene. However, our hygiene is as good as it was a decade ago, if not better; it's the vaccination rates that are dropping and bringing measles back.**

Indeed, anyone seeing the decline of infectious diseases as vaccines *or* hygiene is wrong. It is a combination of vaccines *and* hygiene.

# 2. ""Vaccination against measles is not worth the dangerous side effects of MMR.""

It is often claimed that measles is not a dangerous disease and MMR represents a useless danger. Let us look at the numbers of both MMR and measles.

**Here are the side effects of MMR and how often they occur:** \[5\]

* redness, pain and/or swelling at the injection site (more than 1 in 10 patients)
* raised body temperature, loss of appetite, mild rash (around 1 in 10 patients)
* joint inflammation which lasts up to 3 days (around 1 in 10 adults, much more rare in children)
* febrile seizure - caused by fever in children, could require medical attention (up to 1 in 1000 patients) \[6\]
* a rash lasting up to 6 weeks after vaccination (around 1 in 24 000 vaccine doses)
* anaphylaxis - serious allergic reaction requiring medical care (around 1 in 900 000 patients)
* encephalitis - serious brain swelling, can lead to permanent brain damage and death (1 in 1 000 000 patients) \[7\]

**Now let us look at the symptoms of measles:** \[7\]

* high fever (more than 2 in 10 patients)
* diarrhoea (around 1 in 12 patients) \[8\]
* ear infection - can lead to permanent hearing loss (around 1 in 14 patients) \[8\]
* pneumonia - can be fatal (1 in 16 patients)
* encephalitis - serious brain swelling, can lead to permanent brain damage and death (more than 1 in 1000 patients, as opposed to 1 in 1 000 000 recipients of MMR) \[7\]

**Measles is at least 1000 times more dangerous than MMR.** But in fact, it is even more dangerous. Far from being extinct thanks to falling vaccination rates. WHO reports that **more than 140 000 people died from measles in 2018**, most of them being children under the age of 5. \[9\] And that is without adding mumps and the horrible birth defects of rubella into the equation.

A commenter pointed out that, in the USA, MMR is potentially more dangerous than measles as measles outbreaks are still relatively manageable. However, if vaccination rates keep getting lower, the dangers of measles will inavoidably become more pronounced. Taking iodine pills where there isn't a risk of radiation is a bad analogy, because not taking iodine pills doesn't cause nuclear fallout. But not taking MMR does cause the resurgence of this dangerous disease.

# 3. ""Vaccines contain toxic and harmful substances such as mercury and aluminium.""

It is true that some vaccines contain these and other substances. Let us look at them one by one.

**Aluminium**

Aluminium serves as an adjuvant in vaccines - a wake up call to the immune system to induce a strong response. ""US Code of Federal Regulations recommends that the amount of Al permitted in a single unit human dose of vaccine should not exceed 0.85 mg of Al^(3+) per dose (...)."" \[10\]

Many seem to think our food is not 'contaminated' by heavy metals. This is completely false. An **average human intakes 10mg of aluminium just in food every day**.  In case of drug administration, the normal average intake may reach 50-1000 mg/day, which far exceeds the maximum allowed dose of vaccines. \[11\]

Some evidence points out that aluminium injections can have nasty effects on the nervous system and may be linked to autoimmunity. Yet, despite this, aluminium adjuvants are still widely considered as safe by experts.

**Thimerosal (a mercury containing compound)**

Thimerosal, also known as ethyl mercury, is a vaccine preservative. This compound can indeed be harmful - albeit in large doses. Studies have shown that **thimerosal is degraded in the body in up to 7 days** \[12\] **and does not build up** in the body like its cousin methyl mercury. \[13\]

As for ""methyl mercury and ethyl mercury is hardly a difference"", water (H2O) is crucial to life but differs in just 1 atom from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which burns the skin. Also consider the difference between ethanol and methanol. Ethanol is safe unless consumed in large amounts, while methanol has nasty effects like blindness.

Furthermore, once again, we all consume mercury when eating seafood, in varying concentrations. \[14\]

# 4. ""It cannot be said for sure that vaccines do not cause autism.""

This statement is hard to disprove due to the nature of autism and vaccination: they both 'take place' at roughly the same time. Still, **there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism.**

Why is there a rise of autism then? Most experts agree that this increase is mostly an illusion caused by changes in the techniques of diagnosis and growing awareness. \[15\] \[16\]

The whole idea of the link between MMR and autism comes from a **deeply flawed study which is considered one of the most serious medical frauds in history**. It is beautifully summarised here: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/).

# 5. ""Vaccines are a big business and big pharma makes loads of money from them.""

The so-called 'Big Pharma' conspiracy states that vaccines are big business and turns to alternative medicine instead. **The problem is that alternative medicine is also big business that is only expected to keep growing.** 

# 6. ""Vaccines contain aborted foetal matter.""

It is true that human foetal cell lines are used in the development of many vaccines. However it is important to keep this in mind: \[17\]

* vaccine production requires a host for the virus to replicate in

* many human viruses replicate insufficiently in animals

* animal hosts such as chicken eggs can be unreliable, while living animals can contaminate the vaccine

So human cells are the optimal host for viral replication. Indeed, the only possible host for some viruses. But there's a big problem to using just any human cells: they can't self-renew. After a certain number of cell divisions (known as the Hayflick limit), they become unusable. [18] Embryonic cells have the power of self-renewal, so the same cells can be used almost endlessly.

Rubella (the R in MMR) can cause nasty birth defects in pregnant women and can even kill the foetus. [19]
Some pregnant women who were infected by rubella have decided to terminate their pregnancy. Researchers studying rubella were able to get their hands on one such foetus and develop a rubella vaccine which is still is use today. [17]

""These same embryonic cells obtained from the early 1960s have continued to grow in the laboratory and are used to make vaccines today. No further sources of fetal cells are needed to make these vaccines."" [20]

**It is also important to note that foetal tissue is *not* present in finished vaccines, but is eliminated during processing.** [20]

**Pfizer and Moderna have *not* used cell lines in the manufacturing process, as their vaccines use mRNA instead of dead viruses or antigens. However, the vaccines *did* use a cell line in a pre-clinical trial. A cell line is *not* required for the vaccine production itself.** And for those concerned with religion, Vatican has approved the use of the COVID vaccines which use human cell lines because of the severity of the situation. [21] The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine also used human embryonic cell lines in vaccine development. [22]

Anti-vaxxer rant,47,khlv1s,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/khlv1s/antivaxxer_rant/,14," Anti vaxxers make me mad because it takes such little research to see that vaccines are completely safe. 

They say “oh, it has aluminum, mercury, and aborted fetus cells in them ):<“ but if they actually learned about vaccines they will learn that aluminum is an adjuvant, which inhanses immune response (it’s also in their deodorant, antacids, cheese, cake mix, and their baking soda). Mercury, or thimerosal, is an anti septic preservant. Theres worse and more dangerous preservatives in their food. And the ‘aborted fetus cells’ are fetal tissue used to grow the viral rna. No one us getting injected with human cells. And those fetal cells could be ANYTHING! They could be donated cells from a baby who died in the hospital, circumcised foreskin, etc. It doesn’t have to come from abortions, though that could be a source of it. 

The worst part is, when you try to educate them, they say “I already did my research,” well you obviously didn’t, Susan. 

I did research because I saw what people were saying and it scared me. Maybe I’m just smarter than most people, but after researching all the ingredients I KNOW vaccines are safe. People just seem to read the ingredients of vaccines and assume all the chemicals are bad without researching them. People are also OBSESSED with the idea that the government, doctors, and nurses are out to get them.",1608600619.0,2020-12-21 17:30:19

How Can I Help my Mom?,10,kgc75i,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/kgc75i/how_can_i_help_my_mom/,13,"So, a basic recap of my mom in the past few years:

-She believes COVID is fake, even after three family members died of it

-She believes that the vaccine will make people infertile, place trackers in you, and kill millions of Americans in order to allow China to invade

I don't know what to do. I'm utterly terrified with how my mom has dealt with COVID over this last year. She's convinced my sister's to refuse the vaccine when it's available to them as well. She refuses to even think of things outside of the conspiratorial viewpoint and it hurts me deeply. I've watched my mom just slip into straight up insanity.

"After 10 years, my wife went from full anti-vax to getting herself and our children fully vaccinated. This is how it happened.",58,kft4ua,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/kft4ua/after_10_years_my_wife_went_from_full_antivax_to/,13,"It took 10 years, but my wife went from full conspiracy anti-vax, to scheduling vaccination appointments for herself and our children.

I knew she was anti-vax when we started dating 11 years ago, but I didn't understand then the depth and length to which anti-vaxers are committed to rejecting science. I thought it was like, ""Well, I don't like needles and I have my doubts,"" not, ""I choose to reject all evidence to the contrary and embrace conspiracies about Big Pharma and accept non-science in place of expert advice."" If I had known then what I know now, I'm not sure I'd have continued with this relationship, but here I am now and I'm happy to be here. 

When we decided to start a family, she made it clear that she wouldn't be vaccinating our child. I thought naively that I could just persuade her if I presented factual evidence that showed why vaccines are safe, but it only backfired and she dug in harder than ever. 

""They put mercury in vaccines,"" but nevermind the type of mercury, how it's safely metabolized in the body, the fact that many vaccines no longer use it, and that she's even feeding a substantially higher dose of that same mercury to her children every time she makes a tuna sandwich. 

""It's all a plot by Big Pharma to make money,"" nevermind the fact that vaccines are wildly unprofitable and Big Pharma has been downsizing or eliminating its vaccine work for decades in favor of developing more profitable treatments for chronic diseases. 

""We don't know what causes autism,"" nevermind that there's zero reason to believe that vaccines cause autism except for the work of that ghoul Wakefield who planned to stoke fear about vaccines to help peddle his books and then lost his medical license, and now isn't even qualified to be a dog-catcher.

""You can't trust doctors, they're just pill pushers who only treat symptoms,"" nevermind that she trusted her midwives who are trained at the level of nurse practitioners to deliver her first and our first children, or that the ""root cause"" of a problem is often hard to determine without first treating the symptoms to figure out where they're coming from. 

""I've done years of research on the Internet, you'll never know more about it than me, and you should do your own research,"" nevermind that years of research based on non-science is actually worse than pure ignorance (and she's right -- I'll never know more about it than her, because I refuse to spend that much time reading scared mommy blogs). To this, I often said, ""Yeah, what would happen if I did my own research? How much of my 'own research' can I do and you'll still trust me, or is there a point at which I'll have done too much research and you'll distrust me just like you do the doctors?""

""Vaccines are only necessary if a society lacks infrastructure to provide clean water, sanitation, clean air, and clean streets,"" the implication being that diseases can only thrive in ""dirty"" places that are ""far away,"" nevermind that we live almost a literal stone's throw away from a major steel mill in Canada where the air often smells like lung cancer and a major river that flows through our city is an ""area of concern"" for bacteria and is often unsafe for swimming.

At any rate, I learned in the hardest way possible that there is absolutely nothing that I can say or do to convince her that vaccines are safe and effective. I learned in the hardest way possible that the best thing I can do is to avoid the topic while at the same time never criticizing or correcting her. The moment she feels that she's being condescended, she instantly goes high and to the right, and there's no bringing her down from that.

I made glacially slow progress with her when I mentioned every year, ""I'm going to get my flu shot at the drug store. Need anything while I'm out?"" Or, ""I was getting a physical done at the walk-in clinic, and the guy there let me re-up my tetanus shot. I had no idea they did that there!"" I learned to never engage with her conspiracy theories, and it actually helped a lot.

What really changed things though was when she decided to go back to university. I've heard it said that anti-vaxers and conspiracy theorists should be thought of as people who want to be scientists but don't know how to get started, and in that sense participating in the scientific community is what really accelerated changes in my wife's rejection of conspiracy theories. Three years ago she started classes to major in English and Geography with a minor in biology and a certificate in GIS (think satellite mapping), and she also chose to write an undergraduate thesis about invasive snails. Ambitious, right? She made friends in the science programs at her school, built relationships with her biology advisors, and even got a student job in one of her science professor's labs.

One night, she and I watched that movie about flat-earth conspiracists, ""Behind the Curve,"" and she was just as amazed as I that ""these kind of people actually exist? That's crazy! They're crazy!"" The next day, she was laughing about it with some of her friends in a science class, and somebody remarked, ""Oh, flat-earthers are just insane. They're just like anti-vaxers, you know."" Well, as my wife was telling me this story, she said she replied that, ""No, there's science behind the anti-vax movement, there are reasons for this, blah blah blah."" Well, she told me all this because she was complaining about the way her friends and some of her teachers treated her: the whole group together criticizing her, the looks of mockery and condescension...

Up until that point, it didn't matter what her husband had to say. The pivotal moment that really turned things around for her was when she lost respect in the eyes of her closest friends and respected advisors.

Some time after that, her 12-y/o daughter's class was getting a presentation in school about HPV and all the students were being given forms to take home to ask permission for them to be vaccinated against HPV by a team of nurses that would soon be visiting the school. Her daughter wanted to be vaccinated -- because why not, it's a great idea? -- but her mother refused it. Long story short, her daughter ended up feeling so embarrassed in front of her peers that she asked to stay home from school on the day of the vaccine clinic so she wouldn't feel embarrassed for not participating.

Not long after that happened, my wife asked if I would take care of vaccinating our daughters and she outlined a list of shots she would consent for them to receive. I made some calls, got some things set up, but she got anxious about it and said she no longer wanted me to take care of it. I didn't argue, because I know that arguing only makes this situation worse.

All that was about 15 months ago. Yesterday, out of nowhere, she asks me to make some calls and find out where she can go with both our girls to get vaccinated. I start making some calls, but she doesn't like that she's not handling it, so she asks me to pass her the phone and right there in front of me, after more than 10 years of marriage and figuratively blowing my legs off on rhetorical landmines, she schedules herself, her daughter, and our daughter to start their vaccine schedules. The whole thing was as ordinary as if she were ordering a pizza. I didn't say anything to ask about her change of heart, or offer any remarks about how this was finally happening. We just... crossed the bridge and neither of us said anything about it.

My key take-aways from this decade-long process has been that one person couldn't change her mind. It took literally dozens of people to change her mind, both internally from her own family members, and externally from her personal network of peers and superiors whose friendship and opinions are important to her. And although I'll never really know how much pressure came from herself to change, I'm certain that her involvement in a scientific community brought her progressively closer and closer to accepting and trusting the recommendations of physicians and scientists who work to promote public health and vaccination.

I can't tell you how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop, but I can tell you how many years it takes to change the mind of an anti-vaxer, and the answer is 10 years... with her participation in a scientific community, with pressure from her immediate family members, with pressure from her academic peers and superiors, and first-hand experience learning how the scientific process works.

So, yeah... today is a pretty big celebration for me, and if you've actually read this whole post then I hope that it somehow helps you, too.",1608352644.0,2020-12-18 20:37:24

Anyway, he told me that when he was on holiday in Greece some hotel clerk told him that Greek alphabet has quite a few Russian letters in it, therefore Greek is borrowing from Russian.

Now I am by no means linguistic expert but my basic history knowledge tells me that Greek alphabet is way older than Cyrillic, so that must be wrong. 0.39s later in Google I found dozens of sources confirming that it's the Cyrillic alphabet that is based on Greek one, not other way around. I presented my findings but the reply I got is that 'paper will take anything' and 'anyone can write anything' and it basically turned into an argument how anyone can say anything, and it has always been that way and how we can't confirm it since it have been so long time ago etc...

I can admin when I'm wrong but I'm 100% I'm not so I didn't give up, so eventually he left slamming the door and saying that I need to start using my brain.

How can I convince vaccine-resistant people of the importance of vaccines using scientific proof?,97,k1za0a,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/k1za0a/how_can_i_convince_vaccineresistant_people_of_the/,11,"Hi, everyone. Please, I need your help with this. (My friends are located in Canada 🇨🇦 btw).

We were talking about how I cannot go out because, even if I take every precaution, I don't want to risk getting COVID and infect my grandma since she is very very high-risk (besides bein in her 70's, she's got diabetes, and other ailments that would make it worse for her if she's infected). When told this, they told me they weren't going to vaccinate because they think vaccines can be harmful. I asked them about it, and thought at the beginning they were talking about the bad secondary effects of the UK COVID vaccine during the trials, but no, they meant vaccines in General. I asked if when they had kids, would they vaccinate them? They told me they would be vaccinating them with the most important ones, but not all of them, and also because they believe some vaccines cause Autism; don't ask which, they didn't have a list at hand, and they are not having kids in the near future, so I don't think they are worried about it for now, but they definitely want to have kids in the future.

Let me highlight the fact that they (a couple) are intelligent individuals, but this is outside their area of expertise,, and I feel like they have been lied to; they are **vaccine-resistant** meaning they are fearful of it, but I feel they could be suaded with the right reliable information.

The problem apparently stems from 2 issues:

1. They watched a documentary where they showed cases where vaccines did harm. We didn't go into detail about it, but I did tell them I'd bet them anything I could debunk it with reliable sources, and although doubtful, agreed to look it up and send me the name or link to it.
2. One of them has a family member with a kid with autism (far into the spectrum it seems; Non-verbal), and they are afraid a vaccine would cause that to their (future) kid(s).

So, I want to be able to give them all the information. And I mean ALL the information I can in the best way possible. I will talk to them tomorrow (since it's late and they were going to sleep) and ask them to please let me do them a presentation to show and answer any questions they have; they are not anti-vaxxers, just vaccine-resistant, so I believe they would be open to hearing me out, but I need help with reliable sources please. So far, the presentation that I will be making will be including the following:

1. First, an explanation about the back-fire effect and why it is normal that they don't like facing ideas that challenge what they know. I'll probably use [The Oatmeal's comic](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe) for this.
2. What are vaccines and how they are made, and why you can't related all effects of all vaccines under the same umbrella?
3. Why parents of autist kids (An autistic person told me that this is a more preferable term than to say ""person WITH autism) usually think the condition was caused by vaccines? (Ages of usual immunization and ages of early signs of autism being around the same). Also, the difference between correlation and causation.
4. Why was this idea born in the first place? Talking about the only study that alleged that vaccines caused autism but were later debunked and the Dr.'s license was revoked because of it. How ideas once formed are difficult to get rid of it.
5. How are certain people (or enterprises) taking advantage of this fear and start spreading misinformation? This one I'm unfamiliar with, so I would gladly receive advice on this one.
6. Also, how science deniers usually try to convince people by cherry-picking bad cases, misinterpret studies by ignoring the consensus made on them. Also, an explanation about how we cannot be 100% sure of anything, and why it's importance in science to do conclusion this way. So, a good analysis of the dangers of misinterpreting science studies. I'll most likely use one of the examples in John Oliver's Last Week Tonight's episode: [Scientific Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw), like how *""No difference in preeclampsia or high-blood pressure between women that eat the two chocolates\[, high and low flavanol chocolates,\]""* was interpreted by media as ""*The Benefits of Chocolate During Pregnancy; Eating a moderate amounts of chocolate could benefit mom and baby*"".
7. A detailed explanation of the compounds of vaccines that they believe cause damage. For example, Thimerosal, the organomercurial, its function and the difference with regular mercury. Also, an explanation about how dosage works and how almost anything could kill you when your body receives a certain dosage (even water, apples and coffee). I could even show how anti-vaxxers spread fear by throwing around the names of the compounds of vaccines and debunked by showing how that could be done to ANYTHING, like Gala apples:  >!Ethanol

8. How autistic people see the world and how bad (appalling) it is that some people treated their condition like the plague.
9. How important is vaccination to many organizations, schools, etc. And how their kid(s) could be denied access because of their vaccination status. [Example](https://immunize.ca/immunization-mandatory-canada): In Ontario, and New Brunswick, proof of immunization is required for children and adolescents to attend public school.
10. Information about the UK COVID vaccine's news going around regarding the bad side effects of it. And the explanation of the process of developing a vaccine and why it takes so long and have so many different phases before getting to human trials and so many regulations before making it to the public.
11. Lastly, an explanation about critical thinking, and how you should always question what you learn (mostly about things that could affect greatly your life or that of others).

Also, this presentation gotta comply with the following:

1. No wall of text, only easy to digest videos, diagrams, infographics, and or any media that could help understand the information shown.
2. Reliable sources only. I will need to be able to link any claim made in the presentation to a reliable source, and also a brief explanation of the source (i.e. ""World Health Organization"", ""University X"", ""OECD iLibrary"", etc.).

And that's it. I may even make a video of it at some point but for now, I want to make this presentation. If anyone has any more topics that they think should be included, or if they have good resources (scientific articles, documentaries, studies, etc) from reliable sources, I'd greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time!",1606504153.0,2020-11-27 11:09:13

What are anti-vaxxers willing to accept as a consequence of none vaccination?,6,jugegx,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/jugegx/what_are_antivaxxers_willing_to_accept_as_a/,7,"I had the sudden (debatable I'm sure) notion that being anti-vax must make someone pro-virus or pro-pandemic or pro-natural-death.

Surely to make a stand against something we must be for something else. There must be something we are protecting being standing against it and want more than the thing we are attempting to stop or rejecting, no?!

Let's start with some basics i.e. every choice we make has potential consequences. When it comes to health matters there is a bigger gamble than most daily decisions. As a parent of five, if I were to opt-out of all vaccines or be very selective in what vaccines my children get then I'd be gambling, not just lives but a lifetime of heartache and blame if I lost a child due to an avoidable death.

Is that scenario one that anti-vax protestors accept?

It is my opinion that someone who opts out of vaccination for themselves or their children. Should be billed medical costs (that is the consequence) if they need treatment and have (by record) rejected an offer of the vaccine.

Should they really escape the consequences of opting out of a cheaper treatment that results in a far more expensive treatment or is health services like my NHS Scotland just expected to pick up the costs?

I have managed to type all of this without even bringing COVID into it because this isn't a new topic but it is more important to discuss this than ever before because we are in a pandemic. A COVID19 vaccine is not about prevention like the flu-vaccine and a range of others. This time it's about national recovery and controlling a very unstable global situation.

So in a pandemic and protesting against vaccination. Are anti-vaxers pro-virus or pro-pandemic or pro-natural-death?

Is it possible most of them simply believe they are untouchable like all the other people who have denied the virus even exists, caught it, and some of them died?!",1605445118.0,2020-11-15 04:58:38

Throwaway because obviously being opposed to vaccines is bad.

My whole life I have been all for vaccinations, they are good and sensible and safe.

This was until the Covid pandemic and the rush to get vaccines out.

Now given that this means that the vaccines will obviously be rushed, and not have the same years of testing that other things would have, combined with the fact that pre-emptively the UK government has given  AstraZeneca indemnity from negative side effects, no matter how serious or long lasting.

For the first time in my life I am sitting here and thinking to myself that I don't want to take the vaccine when it is released because it is untested and there would be no recourse from it.

That's 500,000 vaccines worth of mercury, and even the subject of dental amalgam toxicity itself is very controversial. There are other sources of metal toxicity 1,000 times worse and much more recognized than amalgam toxicity. So why do anti vaxxers never ask about exposure to say, industrial manufacturing, bad city water. antacid formulas, copper pipes, mri contrast, lead paint, firearms shooting, etc?

So I am a totally pro-vax medical student (albeit brand new to med school). I was recently asked by a friend how long-term vaccine safety is assessed, and I didn't have a good answer for them. Basically what I said is that most modern vaccines are so specific that spillover side-effects would be very unlikely, and that the phased trial structures assures safety. However, I couldn't really think of a good way of explaining how the Phase 3 trial guarantees long-term safety when it usually is not conducted over a particularly long timeframe.

"Is it possible to be an anti-vaxxer, but somehow not an anti-masker as well?",100,hxb9qo,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/hxb9qo/is_it_possible_to_be_an_antivaxxer_but_somehow/,9,"I'm uncertain if this is the right place to post this, but it's the closest sub to post this question I have.

I made a joke with a friend earlier today about how putting people who are opposed to the use of vaccines (anti-vaxxers) and people who are opposed to wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic (anti-maskers) on the same Venn diagram would basically just be a circle.

But then I thought about it too hard--because what else does one do during quarantine?--and I was able to think of a person who could be an anti-vaxxer yet still not an anti-masker (e.g. someone who is anti-vaccines because they are just so opposed to big pharma and Western medicine, but who still wears a mask in public because they believe it will keep them safe from the virus).  However, I am have a bit of difficulty imagining an anti-masker that is also pro-vaccine.

So I figured I'd ask reddit.  What do you guys think?  Is Figure 1 or Figure 2 more accurate?

She also says that since we have the MTHFR mutation we can't have the mercury they put in there. Which, first of all, it's ethylmercury which clears out of the bloodstream extremely fast, and they don't just put it in there just because, they put it in there as a preservative. So if anyone knows how to convince my mom that they're ok, any help is appreciated.

Anti vax fan fiction found on Facebook,3,hudqee,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/hudqee/anti_vax_fan_fiction_found_on_facebook/,2,"Someone on my friends list seriously posted this. I just copied the text but it had 150 comments last I checked. Omg. 




“Grandma, did people really not wear masks when you were a kid?”

“No, they didn't. People didn't start wearing masks until I was 33, in 2020. [Redacted], your daddy, was 4 when it all started.”

Bobby wrinkles his nose at me and picks up his mask by the door.

“You mean you didn't wear a mask at ALL?!” He says, swinging his around on his finger.

“No, not ever.” I say.

“But how did you stay safe?” Bobby says, setting his mask down.

“Oh, we got sick a lot. Your daddy had the flu when he was 3. It was scary, but he pulled through. He's had his share of colds as a child.”

“That's scary. It's bad to get sick.”

I stop, and think. Is it time? Yes, it must be time. Bobby will be eight soon, and there are things he needs to know. Things it might not be safe for his father or his mother to talk about, things that are safer shared from an older mouth.

I snuggle him up on the couch and try to think of where to begin.

“Now Bobby. I'm going to tell you some things. I want to you to hold these things inside of you and don't talk about them to anyone else, you hear? Some of these ideas can be misunderstood if the wrong person hears them.”

I think he understands. I hope he understands.

“Back in 2020 there was a virus. You probably learned about it in school.”

“Covid 19.” Bobby says. He isn't smiling. “I did.”

“Yes, Covid 19. That was when everything changed.”

“Is that why you had to go to jail, Grandma?”

Now my heart sinks. He's getting ahead of me.

“No, not really.” I say.

“Daddy says you had to go to jail when he was little and he missed you a lot.”

I feel tears prick the edges of my vision, but I blink them away.

“Yes, you see, Grandma didn't like vaccines. I didn't want to vaccinate my children, but a few years after covid-19 we lost the right to choose things like that. But Grandma didn't give up. I fought for the right to keep [redacted]and [redacted] free from vaccines, so I went to jail for awhile. It was hard for your daddy, he missed me a lot.”

Bobby holds my hand, and I remember another little boy, so many years ago who also sat on this couch and held my hand. And I remember his tears as the police took me away from him. I don't want to remember this.

“But vaccines are good for you, Grandma. They keep you safe. We learned about them in school.”

I sigh.

“That's what they say.” I say. “Yet, back when I was a kid, sometime people died after they were vaccinated. Sometimes people were damaged by the vaccines. And we still don't know what is in them. No one will tell us.”

I turn to look into Bobby's eyes. “People still are damaged by vaccines now. Just no one talks about it.”

Bobby scrunches his eyes up. He's trying so hard to wrap his mind around my words.

“The world was a very different place when I grew up.” I say. “We had coins, like the ones in my collection. We spent those coins as money, instead of using the chips we have today. No one wore masks and you didn't have to get vaccinated if you didn't want too. Parents could teach their kids at home if they wanted, and school wasn't year round. You could think what you wanted, no one was arrested for speaking their mind. People met in churches to sing to God.”

Bobby still looks confused. I wonder if he can even picture a world like I am describing. I wonder if he can even understand.

“Kids played together in the streets. We had birthday parties where people would come to your house and hang out. I could hug my friends whenever I wanted.” Now I am getting a bit choked up. It must be my age. I'll be 76 this January.

I swallow.

“Now, Bobby dear, don't go repeating anything I've told you. Keep it hidden in your heart, like the verses we learn over breakfast.”
“Like the bible under the planks in the shed?” He asks. I nod, yes, like the bible hidden in the shed.

Bobby slips from my side. I let him go, hearing the legos tinkle from the other room. The legos his dad collected as a kid.

I sit for awhile, thinking back. Times sure have changed. I don't think they have changed for the better, no matter what the government says. I wonder what other things will change, before my bones go into the Earth. Soon the memories of that other world, that world of freedom and breath... will be buried in my tomb with me. And only the young will remember.

If they can.",1595243001.0,2020-07-20 04:03:21

Pro-Vax vs. Anti-Vax?,6,hntiee,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/hntiee/provax_vs_antivax/,7,"Okay, I have a delima regarding this subject. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for opinions, or if it's even allowed. So please point me in the right direction if I should post this somewhere else. I read the rules and I don't think I'm breaking them... we'll see. :)
I'm using a throw away account incase I mess something up. I'll probably delete the account before too long. Here goes nothing.
I always thought I was Anti-Vax. But apparently, I might not be.
Lemme explain...
People who won't take any vaccinations, no matter the circumstances, are ignorant.
I think I may technically be Anti-Vax, though most Anti-Vaxxers are looked at as Karens. I don't think I am a Karen... I hope I'm not anyway. I would hate to be that type of person.
So even though I may technically be Anti-Vax doesn't mean I believe all those conspiracy theories and crap.
For instance...
Essential oils are not a cure for anything: Essential oils can be helpful if used right, but they aren't a cure for any type of serious sickness. They do smell nice and some can help you sleep, and they can help relieve aches, pains, and some of the symptoms of the sickness so you can cope and get well. But they are NOT magical healing potions. We're not living in a video game.
Vaccines don't cause autism: What the heck? How would someone reach the opposite conclusion????? Vaccines don't cause autism! There MIGHT be a slight CHANCE that a vaccine can make autism (that was already there) a little more obvious.... but no, probably not. I doubt that would even remotely be the case. And even if they did cause autism, wouldn't that be preferable to extreme sickness or death??? 🤦‍♀️
I don't take general shots. Like flu shots. I don't take them. Since the sickness itself is pretty mild, (and since vaccines can be harmful if you don't have a good doctor and it's hard for me to find a good doctor where I live) I just go without. Some vaccines do have chemicals, and some people are allergic to them (at least I think so). That doesn't mean vaccines are bad. But I'd rather spend a week or so with a stomach ache than risk it. I have family history to some allergies. Besides, I don't go out in public that often. So I don't need vaccines as much as others.
But if there's a risk that I could get a serious sickness, like Tetanus, you had better believe I am getting that shot. Leaving the country? Getting a shot. Attending a public school every day or some place with many people and a high risk of catching something? Depending on the season and the sickness, I will get a shot. (I was raised homeschooled, so I never attended a public school in my life.) There are other scenarios that I could probably think of, but I think you get the idea.
I currently don't have kids, but if I ever had kids, I would do a lot of thinking before deciding to vaccinate.
If the kid is at high risk for something, has a dangerous condition, is young and attending a public school, than I probably would get vaccines for the kid. I mean, a lot depends on the person being vaccinated and their situation. Some people desperately need flu shots, for instance. And I don't.
My siblings and I were all raised this way. None of us have every gotten seriously sick or hospitalized for an illness. In fact, I can only remember any of my siblings being in the hospital for stitches or broken bones (you know how kids are. 🤣)
I hope I don't sound like a Karen. I reeeeally hope so. And I hope I'm not the only Anti-Vax that's thinks like this. I may not qualify as Anti-Vax anyway, since I've been told before Anti-Vaxxers are classified by their crazy conspiracy theories? I don't know. There might be a separate group in between Vaxxers and Anti-Vaxxers that I would fall into, that would be something. Lol.
Thank you for reading my post this far. Again, sorry if this isn't allowed.
I've thought I was Anti-Vax for a long time, but I actually don't know. Compared to crazy Anti-Vaxxers, I definitely seem different (so I've been told.) If I am classified as Anti-Vax, I hate being grouped with Karens and people who shame others or push their opinions up into people's faces. Memes, articles, etc seem to always degrade us and think we're all the same, making us out to be child killers. Since I always thought I was classified as Anti-Vax, I was hurt. Most young children need vaccines. Especially for something serious that they're at risk for.
Sorry if I offended you with this whole thing (I'll probably offend a lot of people.) I'd be happy to answer any questions you guys ask me, but I hope and pray that I'm not a Karen. And hey, it would be something if I end up not being Anti-Vax. Lol.",1594285087.0,2020-07-09 01:58:07

Growing up with antivax parents,14,hhqgjp,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/hhqgjp/growing_up_with_antivax_parents/,17,"On mobile, formatting,etc
Im a 20f

Both my parents (48)F &(49)M are antivax. Growing up if I ever questioned why I wasn’t vaccinated they would tell me that because they were doctors, what they say essentially was law. (NOT MD’s I dont want to specify, but lets just say its more... homeopathic). They told me that because I easily get sick and because im allergic to a lot of contact chemicals. That it would infect me. Kill me. And that it was a secret, i couldnt tell anyone i wasent vaccinated. 

But i did tell people, i told a school nurse that chewed me out and raised her voice, She. Was. Pissed. 
I told other kids at school, it was something to make fun of. Hahaha your a gross sick kid.
I got other stories about how when people found out, they would always get pissed. Over the years i stopped talking about it. My last years of highschool i started questioning my health, my parents morals, if vaccines are actually evil.

I spend years feeling confused, i was scared of MD’s. Everything i was raised being told was the truth, crumbled apart. I educated myself, I plan on getting vaccinated behind they’re back. If i ever tell them... well lets just say they would feel betrayed, and disgusted with me. I would become a disgusting thing full of chemicals forever. 

If your confused, if you dont know whats right anymore. Educate yourself. Surround yourself with people that’ll help you.

I know its easy to make fun of antivax parents, but ive been yelled at and called names by people for actions that were out of my control. Make fun of the parents sure. 
But show a little kindness to the children. They have been feed lies, they are victims.

My anti-vax mom said she is open to reconsidering her position and wants to learn more. What do I send her?!,5,hg4su1,antivax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/hg4su1/my_antivax_mom_said_she_is_open_to_reconsidering/,11,"Between COVID-19 and me setting some boundaries regarding her visiting her first grandchild, my mom has said that she wants to “reconsider” her position on vaccines and “become more learned.” She said she was open to me sharing some information with her and I don’t want to mess this up! Does anyone know of any resources or tools I could share with her? I like the Washington Post video series ([Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/series/the-vaccines-project/). 

Her position has always centered around incorrect understandings of science like “I don’t want to inject chemicals, the ingredients are dangerous,” “I prefer to focus on supporting my immune system through nutrition,” “studies are corrupt and paid for by vaccine companies,” and “I know someone whose child developed autism from a vaccine.” This is a lot to start to unpack and debunk and I don’t know how open to scientific information she will be. But I’m thrilled she wants to reconsider! Any advice would be appreciated!",1593194734.0,2020-06-26 11:05:34
