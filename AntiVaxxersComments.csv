"Nice to see that someone cares about keeping away low-quality memes!

"TO ALL YOU ANTI VAXXERS

You are killing your children by not vaccinating them. It may seem dangerous but without vaccines, your child could die in the blink of an eye. Please vaccinate your child so that diseases can’t spread. A vaccine is just a weaker harmless version of a virus that trains your body to defend it if you get infected. Without vaccinations, diseases will spread and wipe out many people. 



And just for the record, herbs and oils won’t stop your child from dying, vaccines will",ctsbks,2019-12-29 00:44:11

"First let me say.

I vaccinated my children because I agree with you.... in part.

But.....

>A vaccine is just a weaker harmless version of a virus

It is not 'just' that at all.

Vaccines also have hundreds of various chemicals and toxins (I have a list available if you're curious) added to them to help bind the virus to our body.

The immune system also has to fight the toxins and chemicals and sometimes, (very rarely I must add) these chemicals can cause a patient to have an allergic reaction, causing notably, autism, sickness and sometimes it's fatal.

I researched this long and hard before I decided ultimately, to vaccinate my children. 

I found that more people die of preventable diseases yearly than have ever died of vaccines to date. Statistically I couldn't take that risk.

I'm happy to say my family is healthy and well with absolutely no adverse side effects.

I have done my personal best in researching this issue and can confidentially send them out into the world knowing they won't catch the viruses they are vaccinated against. As a mother that is a comfort.

But please don't state things like ""it's just the virus"" it gives the antivaxers too much to argue against because it simply is not true.

If a single person doesn’t get vaccinated they can get the virus and pass it to others. They can also pass the virus to surfaces. Just because you are vaccinated doesnt mean you are 100% safe. Although they do help they arent a holy shield. Having a single person unvaccinated can cause a huge risk to everyone else.,jbgrrw,2020-10-16 21:35:12

"Hey, I wanted to come and thank you.  I used to be vaccine unsure (not anti, but I doubted their need/safety).  What convinced me was eventually a very kind discussion with my son's doctor, where she explained things like how much of certain ingredients there were compared to things we commonly encounter in daily life.  She looked up and found out the change in ingredients from when I was a kid, that made it extremely unlikely my child would have a seizure after a vaccine, like I did as a kid. 



 I was interested then, and luckily ran across people online that were willing to share statistics with me regarding long term effects of diseases vs their respective vaccines.  Because, like all medicines/treatments, vaccines do have occasional side effects.  People denying that made me previously discount anything else they had to say.  But someone showing me the % of people who've gotten long term brain injury from measles vs the measles vaccine made a huge difference.  It convinced me to not just be comfortable with vaccines, but become pro-vax.



My issues were never conspiracy level conviction in evil pharma, nor did I ever believe vaccines had any relation to autism, so maybe I was easier to convert.  My main issue was an extreme devotion to bodily autonomy, and not being comfortable giving shots or any meds to infants that weren't ""immediately medically necessary"".  I got an inflated sense of the safety risks involved from the dreaded Mom Groups, and thought that the injury rates were actually comparable between vaccines and the diseases they prevent.  



Another argument that helped convince me was that being anti-vax is ableist.  That even if inconvenient, or possibly undesirable, it's a societal duty to protect people who cannot be vaccinated.  This has come into even clearer focus with the pandemic.  The thing is, being called a moronic child abuser actually pushed me further into the clutches of those groups.  I could take people thinking my opinion was stupid or misinformed in stride, but personal attacks against parents really made me discount any science those same people might want to present.



I get that it's valid to want a space to shout your own beliefs and feelings into.  In your own groups, that's fine.  But it does do damage to try and use hateful attacks instead of fact based rhetoric when actually interacting with someone ""anti-vax"".  If your goal is to upset them or piss them off, whatever, I guess.  But it is possible to convert people, and that is NOT done with ad hominem attacks.  I always doubt if someone really cares about getting more people to vaccinate when they're just throwing insults back and forth with someone in a comments section.


So yeah, just, thanks for pointing this out.  I really hope people will take this space to vent, then go out with much calmer heads and share facts with people to try and convince them.  Even if 99/100 people you encounter discount you, it *matters* if you are able to convince one person to change their mind.",jbgrrw,2021-04-09 15:50:43
"It is not 100%, but if it is 80% effective then 80% of people vaccinated will not get the virus even if exposed to it

This covid disease is a complete government and big corporation fabrication and the supposed vaccine roll out is nothing more than a cyber virus.

I was antivax because my parents were after I ended ending up in the ER with a reaction to DTP and was later diagnosed with mild autism, at the time there was a lot of public concern about DTP and brain injury or autism

I actually did get pertussis as a kid and it was not fun to be sick for so long, but I thought it was way better than having a potentially life threatening vaccine reaction

I looked into the issue rather extensively as an adult and am not antivax anymore, in fact I just recently got my second Pfizer dose, but I have avoided the pertussis vaccine since that time I went to the ER at like 18 months old

When I stopped being antivax and got vaccinated for tetanus I made sure they gave me the version of the tetanus vaccine that does not come with pertussis, I just don't want to risk it given my previous reaction, and the safety studies I've found on pertussis vaccines are grossly inadequate, unlike the safety data for most other vaccines",nq3rag,2021-06-02 03:07:35

Everything is a theory unless every aspect can be predicted, explained and completely understood. Until you achieve that standard it's a theory, after that you can express then as laws.

So, where's the studies that show pathogens are not the cause? Oh yeah, there isn't any.  Terrain THEORY? Seriously? You seem to have different standards for your favourite BS.

"At a much, much lower rate.",npbg96,2021-06-01 15:46:40
"An interesting point I herd from an esteemed virologist recently:  the virus rips quickly through populations of unvaccinated people with those who recover having better immunity compared to vaccinated people.  The better immunity is due to their immune system recognising the whole virus (protein coats, and other surface proteins) not just the ACE2 spike protein, which is all that current vaccines provide.  Vaccines that contain only a specific spike protein and still allow for transmission are a perfect way of breeding vaccine resistant variants.  Until we develop vaccines that completely prevent infection and transmission, the virus will pose a risk.  If people get infected, self isolate and don’t spread the virus, they are doing more to enhance herd immunity and protect others in the community than those who choose to get vaccinated.

Until 2011, Michael Yeadon worked as the vice president and chief scientist in a drug discovery research unit at Pfizer.

At the time of the unit's closure, research focused on developing compounds that targeted asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Yeadon's title was not ""Vice President and Chief Science Officer of Pfizer"" as a video that went viral in April 2021 claimed, and many of the claims he made were unfounded and lacked scientific or empirical evidence.",np7s30,2021-05-31 18:02:43

“First, we’ve got population,” he said during the talk organized by TED, a non-profit organization devoted to spreading ideas. “The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.”

I’ll stop you right there don’t have to answer them all, no one can do it. Since the dawn of time humans have only survived by the help of others. No one human can do everything. The society we live in has only understood this and made it work on a broader level. even if you didn’t work at a costco or wherever, you’d still have to work, just like any animal in the world has to work to survive",nnr15q,2021-05-30 03:59:42

"In what way have we evolved? We actually have been indoctrinated. Since birth we are penetrated with vaxxines like we are dogs or something then we have to go into a school system etc etc. how do you think we survived all these years? We used to know how to garden we used to have fruit trees everywhere. The people who ate animals hunted their food without guns, we used to know how to make clothes cmon you get it… this system isnt even 200 years old and we actually went backwards. How is it thats the pyrimids perfectly align with the constellations of the stars? How are the images so perfectly carved into the pyrimids? Did you know that helecopters and other things we have today even wifi is carved onto the pyrimids? And thats thousands of years old. We devolved. We would know how to garden and make clothes, tools, hunt, build if we werent indoctrinated by this system. And i just realized something. This whole system is a pyrimid scheme. You have the poor people at the bottom holding the pyrimid in place without even knowing and WORKING THE HARDEST then the more you go to the top you have the people who work less and make more and have more power. Also why is it that our parents are jailed if we dont out our kids in school? Why is it that most people fear the police (cant speak for caucasions) when they are supposed to be the heros and protectors of the people? Police barley stop crime. They come after the crime is done and most officers, judges, politicians are narcs and assholes.

And once again, no one knows every single thing that they need in order to survive, (once again using natives because they are a great example) men learned how to hunt, women learned how to garden and preserve food etc etc… they still lived in a society just a different one.

 I’ll just skip the whole vaccine thing cus.. yeah no, and not the pyramids either cus I don’t know much about them and i don’t care enough to look it up.

Now, do you know what a pyramid scheme is?? Because society is not that whatsoever lmaoooooo. You choose what to do you decide what path you want to take. You are not forced to fetch money for others so that you can gain a higher standard, you work so that you can buy things you desire, labour and payment, that’s always how it’s worked for every single animal on earth

"Again, honest open question to understand this and I hope this leads me to have a better understanding of the link you are making, the proning position you speak of is used to open the airways to allow the ventilator to push the oxygen into the lungs with patients having severe failure on the ventilator. Not the immediate position used when initially put on the ventilator. Our lungs are mostly on our back, so in that regard laying on the stomach with a downward angle keeps us from adding pressure to an already constricted airway due to the thick fluid build up. Thus, allowing the ventilator to push oxygen in to hopefully keep you alive long enough for your body to fight past dry drowning. I agree that the ventilator creates its own complications that may exacerbate an already bad situation, but the ultimate use of the ventilator and it's creation was to assist those that were unable to breath on their own and in this covid situation, time. Time to give a persons body the ability to fight the virus causing the chain reaction to fluid build up. Complications related to ventilator use is usually dealt with simultaneously or shortly after you are weaned off the ventilator. Additional funds to hospitals for use of covid related therapy such as a ventilator was made thru the CARES Act due to lawmakers taking into account the extra resources necessary to take care of COVID diagnosed patient with conditions requiring hospitalizations. I understand your reasoning, but in order to profit on this the doctor and hospital would have to provide detailed information on patients vitals, appearance and overall head to toe analysis to justify use of ventilator. Also, nurses notes, respiratory therapist, pulmonologist, cardiologist etc. Medicare only pays with liability in mind. So subsidies come with scrutiny. Your version is plausible in only  very generous circumstances and without the red tape that currently exists. Your facts on ventilator use is also half true on both ends. Again, healthy debate. Please refute.🙏",nnuqcm,2021-06-01 00:14:45

You can be on a ventilator in a non-covid situation and still die.

Saying science isn't real is like saying all observations are false. You clearly don't even know what science is. Science is really the most credible concept because all it is is performing a test and recording the results. It is the collection of man's greatest knowledge and no advancements would be possible without it. Cars could not exist, surgery could never happen. You would not be able to make shitty reddit conspiracies because phones would not exist and we would still be using sticks and stones like animals. We would still believe that we are in the center of the universe and would be dancing to a sun god for recourses.

 Not to mention, the FDA also has given Covid 19 emergency use authorization meaning they also have reviewed it to be safe. And don't even try to say they also are also lying. The entire point in the FDA is to sue companies for unsafe medical products and to take those off shelves. In other words, they would be motivated to find problems with it so they can sue CDC, because THAT'S HOW THEY PROFIT. 

&#x200B;

Secondly, you clearly do not understand how vaccines work. They can't really have long term side affects because they are only in affect for a few minutes. The body remembers how it reacted to the vaccine, and thus trains the body on how to deal with the real virus. Bad reactions in vaccines almost always happen in a few days, but occasionally happen after months. So experimentation is very clearly over.  We also have been working with covid related vaccines for quite some time, and have experience in dealing with it. Keep in mind, Covid 19 is a covid variant, not an entirely new disease. 

&#x200B;

TLDR for all the sources:

long term side effects for vaccines are extremely rare, and typically happen in the first few days and are minor.

We have been working with covid vaccines for decades since we have have covid related viruses for quite some time, and there is no evidence to say CDC made the vaccine.

&#x200B;

According to [theconversation.com](https://theconversation.com)

""For starters, serious side-effects are very, very rare. And, together with what we know about previous vaccines, if side-effects are going to occur, they usually happen within a few months after getting a vaccine. This is why international medical regulators, including Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), require the first few months of safety data before approving new vaccines. This, plus information coming from vaccine recipients in the northern hemisphere, gives us confidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.  
In fact, most side-effects occur within the first one or two days. And most of these are minor, such as pain at the injection site, fatigue or fever — which are signs your immune system is building a response against the thing you’ve been vaccinated against.""

according to [muhealth.org](https://muhealth.org)  ""

""mRNA vaccines. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to deliver a message to your immune system with instructions on how to fight the coronavirus infection.  
  
Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. mRNA vaccines have been studied before for influenza, Zika and rabies. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells."" 

 

According to ""[reuters.com](https://reuters.com)""

""There is no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic was deliberately planned or that Bill Gates has any links with such a plan.""

A few things I'll add.

 The statistics about how it has been affecting the public are not based on what happens behind closed doors, but are what has happened IN PUBLIC. You cannot lie about those because every one was recorded as soon as it was reported, before being saved in databases all hospitals have access to add to. 

Secondly, I never gave a defense for you saying  my other source I used to back how safe the vaccine is bias, so I'll do that now.  You clearly did not check what the website is. It is a medical journal website. JOURNALISTS DO NOT PROFIT OFF THE VACCINE. THEIR JOB IS TO DO RESEARCH ON MEDICAL SITUATIONS, AND WRITE ABOUT THEM. They are not even connected to CDC. 

Before you make up some crazy theory about how they are actually connected and we just don't know, actually share some sort of evidence or source for your bs claim along with the others. 

&#x200B;

In conclusion, we DO know the long term side effects on the vaccines as it is quite similar to others. We are NOT under experimentation, as effects can only happen as long as a a few months later (2-4 months, but rarely even that),. The Vaccine has very positive statistics and no related deaths as I have proven with credible sources. And CDC did NOT make the Virus.",nmpqd1,2021-05-30 02:23:26

"Firstly, your statistic in flat out wrong, in the U.S, the survival rate is  98.2%, and the worldwide death rate is 99.107%

Now that that's out of the way, I don't think you quite realize how high that 1.8% death rate is. That number translates to 594K deaths in the U.S and 3.51M worldwide.

for comparison, the flue has a **0.1%** mortality rate. *Still think covid's a joke?*

well FYI, that actually made it **the leading cause of death in the U.S**.

Small question, do you think 9/11 was a joke? Fun fact, after December 2020, that's how many people were dying **daily** to the virus until the vaccine was made.  So ur bs interpretation of your incorrect statement doesn't really mean much when 1.8 percent is that much. It's because of Karens like you that over 20,000 of those people died. Grow tf up.

I mean really, Reuters and the conversation.com aren't even primarily medical websites. You can call them bias, but you need some sort of evidence to prove that.

Also in the 1800s most antivaxers did not die from being antivax, as the only vaccine back then was for smallpox, which you would only get once and the case fatality rate was 30% for the more common strain and 1% for the less common strain [https://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/smallpox/en/](https://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/smallpox/en/)",nm9ht7,2021-05-29 20:42:15

"*None of this post is official or professional advice and solely my personal opinion.* Not anti-vax but I'm gonna go on a COVID rant since that's the hot topic these days.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html (Updated Mar. 21, 2021)

The CDC's ""best estimate"" says that in the 18-49 age group, only 500 will die out of a million infected. That would be a survival rate of 99.95%.

There's also the fact that mRNA vaccines are experimental, but I won't be going into detail. Some of the vaccines were classified as ""poisons"" in Australia because they technically did not go through proper trials. I think that the way the COVID vaccines use cutting-edge technology and being so widely rolled out is kind of baffling to be honest, as I don't think the situation is serious enough to warrant skipping the safeguards we have in place already.

https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/

The spike protein that is used in the vaccines also causes its own problems for the body. Quotation from article describes COVID as ""vascular not respiratory,"" which would explain some of the symptoms that may appear after vaccination.

https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/good-news-mild-covid-19-induces-lasting-antibody-protection/

You may develop immune response to COVID from a mild infection. These cases were all symptomatic in the study. Cells in the bone marrow will continue to provide antibodies.

Antibody-dependent enhancement is when a virus uses existing antibodies to its advantage. This so far has not been shown to happen with the COVID vaccine, and the vaccines seem to have a very good efficiency and also prevent infection from variants.

I am not ""antivax"", but like everything there is a risk vs. reward. I am firmly convinced there are other factors in play that determine the severity of infections. I'm sure you've heard of ""PFAS,"" the forever chemicals? They are everywhere in food wrappings and the environment, just like plastic.

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/pfas-exposure-linked-with-worse-covid-19-outcomes/

I think pollution is a large factor that determines whether or not your immune system can handle COVID. As a young male who has no interactions with anyone (not that any old people I know care about it), I see the choice as I can either take an experimental medicine with minor harm or roll dice that are heavily in my favor. Legitimately the only thing getting vaccinated would do for me is letting me travel earlier. From all the research we're still doing on the vaccines though, they seem to be very effective and will hopefully remain effective in the future.",nm4311,2021-05-27 11:46:53

"I see mixed discussion about whether or not these modified spikes have an issue binding to ACE2, which would be the cause of harm. I have not found a reputable source on the actual vaccines for whether or not they bind. An interesting link I didn't earlier (would have been personal speculation) is that this may be the cause for blood clots: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252960v1.full

I think there have been something in some formulations that cause blood clots, like the J&J which was discontinued in many places for a short while. Whether or not this could be the spike binding or something else, I have no idea.",nm4311,2021-05-27 22:32:26

"i lost braincells, sleep, and faith in that sub, do not reccommend going. it will take a mental toll.

One thing i did learn and respect is the people who have had covid who dont want the vaccine. 

literally the only positive info i could find for healthy people to get vaxxed after beating covid naturally was the ""possibility"" that its more effective. 

if anyone can prove that wrong or provide insight thatd be cool. 

Also vax companies not being held liable, but also the govt saying the vaccines are safe seems to be a tipping point for most.

If theyre safe then why wouldnt the profit company be held liable. Short answer is speed. But still how can you argue that point?",nlvcro,2021-05-29 04:06:08
"Really? Cause the dude is right. We don't actually have ""control"" over a virus. When it shows up, theres little we can do about it. Even the most sure fire measures of out right stopping a virus aren't always going to work.... COVID is proving that one right now.",nlvcro,2021-05-29 06:40:53
"Well its dumb to look at how weve handled covid as a species as proof. If all the deniers had done everything that was said to prevent it for a year straight you might have a case.but i personally know tons of people who lived as they normally would. instead they use the rational peoples distancing and measures as an example of how over played it is. Listen i dont know it all and i dont know everything about covid. What i do know in regards to paranoid fear mongers is were already the govs lap dog and they could posion us a  million different ways rather than a optional controvertial shot, just to the people who think it may be malicious.

I sense you may be more grounded and just think why the hell should i get a rushed shot when im healthy. and to that i say the same thing. I trust the nerds who fell in love with virology far before covid more than any politician or news outlet. Im 25 do people my age even have cable? thatd be weird. Anyways i tried to look up reasons for someome to get vaxxed if theyve already had covid and it was just a possibility of it working better. So i literally have nothing to say to you. We all have to look out for eachother in the end game. there will be more viruses so to me this is a simple fire alarm. the way some people treated it was akin to children. Viruses are older than us, they multiply exponentially which alows them to evolve comparably to a computer learning chess. through random mutations that result in a success and so it is spread.",nlvcro,2021-05-29 07:38:44
"also thats just not the case,  to say we cant control a virsus is like saying we cant build a house to protect us from weather. We live in a material world with material solutions. Polio has been eradicated in all continents except asia. You wouldnt remember that nor would I. Theres a serious lack of respect for history today. ""Polio is basically eradicated therefore it doesnt exist"". If people lived 500 years, your tone would be alot different. Its this same mentality that allows for rampant unchecked capitalism, make hay while the sun shines. i havent seen therfore i cant see is detrimental to humanity. And thus history repeats itself",nlvcro,2021-05-29 08:03:24
"Okay, first off... just edit your posts if you got more to say. Second, the people that, ""lived their lives normally"" are exactly why it's been an entire year where we've had to put up with the bullshit COVID has brought with it. As for Polio, thats a case of what happens when people actually LISTEN to the folk that step forward and say, ""hey everyone, we need to do X to help resolve this problem""

Had everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE listened when the government, medical experts, CDC, pretty much everyone that had any semblance of know how on this topic stepped forward and said, ""hey guys, if we all do this thing it'll keep the virus under control long enough for us to figure out what to do in a timely fashion"" then we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

Had the Chinese government not pretended COVID wasn't real and allowed it to spread past their borders, it would have been an after thought to the world at large.

Had we not collectively decided to do the exact same thing when it did start spreading, the statistics for it wouldn't be as high as they are.

Looking at how we've handled things as a species, is very much valid, and it's easy to say we've fucked up big, and are continuing to do so since this whole kerfuffle should have been addressed, assesed, and dealt with last year. Instead everyone chose to ignore, deny, make wild aspursions to the situation, AND continue to do so while the death toll continues to rise even as vaccines are finally coming out, and anyone amongst us with any degree of sense can be compaired to herding cats as they try in vain to convince the rubes to actually be reasonable.",nlvcro,2021-05-29 09:47:54

"MRNA vaccines have been in use since 1990, although their use in humans is a lot more recent. The COVID vaccines are the first time they've been used to counter an infectious disease but it's not their first use in humans.

MRNA vaccines have been in use in anti-cancer trials with the first reported studies being announced in 2017. The results of anti-melanoma vaccines have reportedly been extremely positive although the anti-viral efficacy apparently reduces after a year or so. Research is continuing into mRNA vaccines to improve long term efficacy.

It's probably important to clear up some of the basic misconceptions about mRNA. The human body makes mRNA. It existed in all our cells. The difference here is that these vaccines use a synthetic mRNA that is coded to elicit a single defined response. mRNA carries the instructions for creating proteins. They do not, as claimed, reprogram your DNA.

mRNA also breaks down very quickly. It has a very short lifespan - between minutes to hours. The proteins created from those instructions, in the case of vaccines, mirror a targeted portion of the virus. In this case it's the 'hook protein' used by the virus to invade human cells. Once the immune system is trained to recognise that 'hook protein', it can react when the real thing comes along.

There is a lot of scaremongering about experimental vaccines when they are actually not experimental at all and mRNA itself is an essential part of the human body's cell management system. There is plenty of reliable information online but you won't find hard facts on alternative medicine websites.",nlcvx8,2021-05-27 03:29:47
"[https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/)   Here you will find what POISON will do in the human body.  ""Well, I got it and I am fine"" - for now. microscopic proteins  are gonna take some time to do whatever it is they do in the human body.",nlcvx8,2021-05-27 02:36:56
"So RNA is a bit of information similar to DNA. The difference is, it has a different structure, making it unable to interact with DNA. mRNA is used in cells to make proteins. Since it's important for a cell to react to its environment, mRNA is quickly recycled by RNAses. In bacteria, mRNA can be digested as quickly as a few minutes after it's made. In us, it's usually a few hours.

mRNA in the vaccine has been artificially manufactured to create just a spike protein. This protein is what causes Corona to inject its RNA into a cell, and macrophages recognize it as a foreign thing that needs to be destroyed. So, a cell takes up the RNA, it produces some spike protein and is then recycled.

The spike proteins embed into the cell membrane of the cells that took up the mRNA. They can now be seen by macrophages, which recognize the foreign body. The body launches an immune response to the antigen, and destroys the cells. Macrophages (the front line defenders of the immune system.) Clean up the leftover debris from the attack, destroying any left over material from the cell, including the spike protein.

Now, the body remembers these foreign bodies by producing memory cells. These cells keep representation of the spike protein in them and are capable of producing antibodies should more of this foreign entity come back inside the body. The immune system presents the antigen, and the memory cells pump out antibodies to fight the infection.

In all of these steps, nothing is left over from the vaccine. The immune response is never too harsh to injure the body because the amount of protein in the body is quickly taken care of, and the body is ready to face an actual invasion of the virus should it infect the body. None of this suggest any long term damage.",nlcvx8,2021-05-30 05:34:14

So long term really isn’t anything I’m concerned especially with the vaccine part of the vaccine. 

The minute levels of formaldehyde and mercury in some of the vaccines (do not fucking cause autism lol bare with me!) could potentially cause a reaction in people. I had a reaction to a cortisone injection and lost consciousness myself. These things happen. I’m just saying that’s why we have the funds. Not for kids that end up with cancer for other reasons. 

If the govt was transparent and released all data to the public. We could see for our own damn selves it’s safe rather than just being told. 

Nobody trusts anybody anymore. Especially not the govt. If someone like you saw the raw data you could form it into charts that were easy to read and comprehend for anyone that would ask. And you could say I got the data directly from Pfizer when they released everything. Anyone left still not taking the vaccine knowing it’s 100000% safer than the illness could be determined as a danger to himself or society and be basically court ordered to have it done.

You want a prime example of the suffering not vaccinating your children causes the kid in this article spent **57 days** in the hospital. He couldn’t even **walk** independently for 50 days. His suffering could’ve been entirely prevented for a mere $150 **assuming the doctor actually charged. Most don’t for vaccines.** instead his parents spent  $811,929 on treatments.

"It’s asinine to do so. Vaccines obviously by definition are not poison. Statistically every one ever approved by the FDA has been far safer than the illnesses they’re intended to prevent. People have died from reactions. But I wish antivaxxers knew how fucking small the numbers are. The huge issue is the government covers up how many people have died to try and sway people of their safety by misinformation. I want full raw data. But the govt feels that will prevent further people from getting the jab but I disagree. 

Very few adverse reactions are ever even recorded and that starts all the way back at the person trying to explain a reaction to the dr. And they chock it up to psychosomatic symptoms. (Some very well might be) But when you make someone intelligent feel like they’re being pushed to the wayside it makes them think. 

I had an adverse reaction to a nerve drug that was making me weak in the legs. I informed my doc of this and he said “ you’re not getting a reaction we need to increase the drug.” (I had a minor back injury) He doubled the dose and I lost the ability to urinate the first day. I had to go to the ER and THEY FUCKING IGNORED ME. I could NOT piss. They handed me a urinal and told me to try. It wasn’t until I was screaming so loud in pain I flooded the whole ER room. They finally catheterized me. I peed in the bad and felt so much fucking better. Next day I went back to the ER for back pain. After 15 minutes or so pain in my groin reached unfathomable levels. I swear I swear I SWEAR childbirth is the equal. I SCREAMED THROUGH OXYMORPHONE. Nothing helped. The pain was so intense there. My feet. My back. Omg dude. I cannot describe. (I have a point to make please keep reading.) the drs. Told me I was faking it. 

I refused to continue taking the drug when I was hospitalized (I was faking apparently but they kept me idk) after several days. 4 total. Of slowly gaining feelings in my legs I was able to go home with a walker. I was 25. 

There is no reason to trust the medical system. Because of what I went through and how no matter how much I Blaimed the drug they wouldn’t even entertain the thought. 

So… when people say something happened with the vaccine. It should be recorded. Full transparency in the data is REQUIRED for a better future. I’ll be damned if I don’t defend the sane people saying something is wrong with vaccines. I’m still pro vax. But nobody can tell me they’re 100% safe. The govt knows they’re not. They have an injury fund set up for cases they have to pay out on. But they ignore most reports and do not keep a tally. 

Our system failed. We have to fight for a fixed system for all. After hearing my story. Do you understand my position? Why I think we should be respectful?

"I’ve heard a lot of these myself. I’m not a microbiologist so it makes sense that you lost me. 

I still can’t label everyone as crazy and can’t treat them bad. With everything I’ve learned in life I know that a bad approach always has bad results. I’ll never give up trying to explain what I can. I go as crazy simple in layman’s terms as I can. 

I love explaining why we have an injury fund for vaccines. It’s simple. 

I love explaining why we have the chemicals in it we do. 

The only thing I don’t get. Is how the government, the CDC contradicts itself on formaldehyde. It says it’s unknown what levels are safe to inject, yet on another page said it was safe in the vaccine. Which is it? 

Btw I read this with my own eyes on the website. Since then. I can’t find them saying it’s unknown anymore now it says it’s safe. It was literally changed when people called it out. But it straight up said it was unknown for the last umpteen years and no extra study was reported saying they had new results. That has me scratching my own damn head.",nlcvx8,2021-05-30 05:35:00
"Well, rather than half their word for it, you could just follow the science, rather than getting things backward. mRNA vaccines do not enter the cell, so there is no 'new instructions sent to your DNA. mRNA within the cell, is created using instructions FROM the DNA and is used to create proteins necessary for life itself.

"Whats asinine here is the fact you needed to go on a lengthy diatribe just to tell me antivaxxers should be taken seriously because you don't trust the government. It certainly sucks that you had to deal with shit from doctors in a privetized medical firm, but firstly, that has nothing to do with how the government operates. Our government and medical system have basically distanced themselves from eachother thanks to aformentioned privetization of the medical system.

Despite that distancing, the two can still come together to agree on things and know what information is nessicary to give to the public. We don't need the raw data on every single little fucking thing. I don't know about you, but last I checked, I'm not a doctor of any stripe so the, ""raw data"" you want so badly likely wouldn't make a lick of sense to me, and I'd be willing to bet it would be just as alien to you as well. Meanwhile, having them tell us that it has been looked into and confirmed that severe complications like death are rare and only hapen in specific demographics, should be more than enough for half-wit laymens like us to take in, observe for ourselves that they likely aren't fucking with us, and moving on with our lives.",nlcvx8,2021-05-30 01:31:14
"Do you mind telling me which vaccine has formaldehyde in it?

Regarding contradictions, science changes based on data presented. Early in the pandemic, not much was known about the virus, how it worked, and the best way to prevent the spread of disease. While the information accumulated with studies, ae gave the best information and guidance based on what we knew at the time. 

Masks for example, CDC recommended not using a mask early on as 1.) Surgical, single use masks were in short supply due to the reluctance to switch manufacturing over to pandemic supplies, so it was best if front line workers like doctors had them and 2.) Alot of people used cloth masks. At the time, we weren't sure if they were effective at preventing coronavirus. So, rather people going into a false sense of security, it was decided it would be better to play it safe and say they weren't proven effective.

Now that studies suggest otherwise, the recommendations changed.",nlcvx8,2021-05-30 05:44:51

"""Imagine thinking that no drugs or medical treatments have ever been discontinued because of harmful effects."" 

\- Who exactly thinks that? No one said they did lol.

Medicine today is evidence-based, relying mainly on systematic reviews and meta-analyses and definitely not anecdotes. I'm not going to take the time to explain why certain methods of research are better than others. Anecdotes can play a limited role in some settings but generally aren't particularly useful (for an array of reasons). 

In regards to the TVT mesh, it caused many problems for patients, many I have seen first-hand in practice. However you seem to ignore the fact that meshes helped a tremendous number of patients with severe stress incontinence. Medicine is all about risk/benefit - and that is exactly why TVT mesh repair has been discontinued in many places, including the UK. Medicine is based on the most up-to-date evidence. If new studies show that a treatment is causing more problems than initially expected, it may be discontinued. Medicine is NOT an exact science - we give you a treatment which has an estimated % chance of working, with an estimated % chance of causing specific side effects etc etc. 

I'm not sure why I'm even responding to this tbh. Just want to highlight that the intentions of 99.99% of doctors are to help their patients with the best possible evidence. If smoking a turnip reduced cancer rates, we'd love it, a nice cheap alternative to expensive chemotherapy drugs. Unfortunately that isn't the case.",nguh59,2021-05-24 18:39:18
So you believe the scientific method should allow asbestos to be used in millions of homes before realizing that it's carcinogenic and billions of dollars of law settlements will need to be paid?

"Uhh.. the comment I replied to clearly tried to refute every claim made about medical treatments being recalled.

I don't know how small your pea bran is, but the comment made no acknowledgement to the fact that treatments are recalled all the time due to harmful effects, and instead tried to brush off the examples given as easily justified by upgrades in methodology. Even if the examples given were poor, the point remains the same. The idiot I replied to was just acting like a smart ass. 

The intentions of doctors are great and all, but it doesn't change the fact that they're brainwashed in pharma-funded med schools. The only doctors that are worth anything are emergency-care surgeons. The rest of them are drug dealers, plain and simple. Doctors are embarrassingly incompetent when it comes to chronic illness. MS, fibromyalgia, lyme disease, autism/ADHD, lupus, chron's/colitis, IBS, all forms of cancer, diabetes, herpes, acne, eczema, psoarsis, vitiligo... the list goes on and on and on. Mainstream medicine has absolutely dropped the ball as it relates to healing chronic illness. I'll repeat, the only thing they're good for is broken bones and removing aneurisms with a robot. Good luck proving me wrong on that.

">There is nothing I could say to convince you otherwise. If I provided you with an essay, citing the best available research on clinical outcomes for the conditions you mentioned, you would simply a) not read it b) claim the studies are corrupt/fraudulent/inaccurate

You're absolutely correct. There's not a chance in hell I would disregard the vast communities of people suffering from those illnesses all over the internet with little to no help from allopathic medicine. There's a reason they all seek alternative medicine. No bullshit research on ""clinical outcomes"" would compel me to throw out common sense. My brain just doesn't work like that, because I'm not cucked by fake ""science"" like you are. You've been brainwashed to the highest degree, and anyone suffering with those illnesses will quickly find out just how competent the medical industry is. I take it you haven't dealt with anything like that yet, hence your blatant ignorance. 

""I'm guessing you have never conducted research yourself or have the faintest idea about research methodology in th field of medicine?""

I'm well aware that the only way a study can take place is if there's enough funding behind it. I'm also well aware that researchers are paid for a service. Either you provide the outcome your employer is looking for, or you don't feed your family. Pretty straightforward.

- covid is more likely to get you than the vaccine
- all the vaccine does is inject you with a part of the dead virus in order for your lymphocytes to memorize the antigen formation in order to shut covid down when you come into contact with the real thing to kill it easier.

On the other hand why would you think that autism is bad ? Just because everyone says so ? And who was that person to decide/judge on this subject of autism. Many of those who works with these type of things have no soul, they have nothing appart their knowledge from the past (past is because psychology at the moment is in very poor condition based on the works were done in previous century by people born in earlier century) they can't even agree on the terms what autism is they just say it have many different subtypes and crap like this.

Me for example, I don't like to interact with ""any"" people or with socium because I see no reason to do it. I don't like to listen how random person telling about his life it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, I don't like to speak about weather or neighboor or maybe politics. I have few friends with who I can talk on subjects that not any can understand and I find it enough. Why I have to socialize my self at all? Any pros I can get out of it? Apart of being involved in something stupid like this pandemic. I'll just waste my time on it.

You are young enough to learn yourself and don't try to fill your whole being with crap that comes from outer world. Maybe this what you have will lead you to something special , lots of great minds were/are not in the list of universally recognised type of so called mental healthy person , and you know why ? Because in nature there is no such thing as mental healthy person or animal or virus or bacteria and etc. You have to understand one thing everything you have was chosen by you (before you got here).

Basically, covid is a non threat. also how are we going to make vaccines for covid if you can't even detect it properly or know whether it still exist?

Vaccines are supposed to only lower symptoms of covid for 2 weeks (then become no longer effective, due to virus mutation) and provides 95% protection (for 2 weeks) but have 5 to 10% chance of giving adverse side effects (in the short term and long term).

"First off, good on you for citing legitimate sources, that's relatively rare on the internet and appreciated. 

Unfortunately I do have a couple of objections:
1. NYT stares found that around 1.4 billion doses of vaccines have been administered. Assuming a two-dose strategy, that would be roughly 700 million. (Probably more considering so many countries are delaying the second dose). 
So in a way you're right, we're not even close to 179 million, we're waayyyy past that. 

2. Pardon my French but I call bullshit on that quote (if it's real, I'd love to see a source, with the context)

3. No long term studies have been done on the long-term consequences of getting Covid and recovering (assuming you recover) either.

More to the point, you're technically right but there's no reason to think that this vaccine is in any way more dangerous than the polio vaccine, the rubella vaccine, the yearly flu vaccine, the tetanus vaccine, the chickenpox vaccine, or the HPV vaccine. 

""The People is the long-term study"" - everyone who gets it consents. No one is being forced or misled in any way. The numbers, and all the relevant data is available, people are allowed to make their own decisions and people chose to trust the vaccine.",ndwox1,2021-05-16 22:52:00

Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.

"Millions have been vaccinated. Few have died. That bullcrap number of 4,000 in the US is from a database taken way out of context, they are total deaths of those vaccinated, not a record of deaths caused by the vaccines. 

If half the US is vaccinated, that record keeps deaths of people of ALL causes, and yes, 4000+ will die of car accidents, cancer, heart attacks, as they do every year. 

Actual vaccine deaths occur at a rate that's no more concerning than aspirin deaths or peanut allergy. 

So unfortunately I will be around to bash you even harder in the future. ""Long term effects"" BULL shyet! How long are we talking? Might die in 50 years?

"Primary sources are evidence; your hearsay is not. if your claim (that Bill Gates said that in a TED talk) is true, then you should be able to provide a link. 

let me save you time: if you cannot find the link, trying to use the claim that ""they deleted it because XXXX reason"" doesn't support your claim, even if you can prove XXXX reason. That's the way logic works. 

The reason the primary source is essential is twofold: 

1. it proves he said what you claim he said
2. even more important, it provides valuable context that may be missing from the discussion, and that context may contradict the claim made.

"My opinions on the covid-19 vaccine are
The 3500 deaths you are mentioning are only deaths that happened after they had taken the vaccine they are not actually people dying from the vaccine but rather people dying some time after taking it(Could be a wide range of causes) . None of those deaths have been linked to the vaccine and are likely caused by another reason. Quote'A number of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to Covid-19 vaccines' Source: 'www.cdc.gov'
Even if they were the fatality risk is 0.0017% which is monumentally lower than the 2% fatality from covid
My other thought is
These vaccines in order to be able to used have been tested on 100000 people before. Also by this point over 300 milion people have been vaccinated so thats a lot of people who it has been tested on. 
Note: I am not saying i am right but thats how i look at this.

" Are you also considering the other side of this? How the the pcr test don't determine whether or not you are actually sick with covid yet they are still being used to diagnose people with covid 🤔 Meaning people who test positive for covid may be dying from another cause which would mean that the data has been skewed - we truly have no clue who and how many actually died from covid. Yes the same data you are talking about is also skewed because it works against the narrative and evidently favours the left. Furthermore, hospitals who diagnose a cause of death as covid recieve a good lump sum from billionaires who fund them, what an incentive right! If your only source of Information is the MSM  or some cuck online, I am afraid you are being mislead my friend. The MSM and social media platforms are shadow banning valid information so you have to dig for it.

There we go thats better your giving something. Thanks :D. Aight so lets get to what im saying. I said i dont like talking about the people in these kinds of numbers it puts a dehumanizing coat over it however we have to look at this differenetly were talking about 1 bilion people by this point. My main point in this was that 0 actualy cases of death from the virus itself have been prooven. While there have been deaths after the taking of the vaccine they are not confirmed and could be a variety of reasons (Has to be done on a case by case study). You saying that this virus was released intentionally does nothing in your argument because no matter what you cant deny the fact that people are dying from it and we have to stop it. We cannot let people who cant help themselves die. While there IS a risk from the vaccine its not a risk of you dying but rather getting a fever or something. Yes im talking from numbers because again this is 1 bilion people and i cant talking about one random joe shmoe. As the number stand you have the same chance of dying from the virus that you have of getting a fever from the vaccine.

"Serious question here. I am 100% not trying to incite anyone. I am geniuinely interested.

If two vaccinated people meet or a vaccinated person and an unvaccinated person, is the risk of transmission different?

Also if it is transmissed in both of these situations, would the infection (given to the unvaccinated person) be worse from the unvaccinated person than from the vaccinated person?

"Antibodies need to know what the virus is before it is able to respond and mark it for destruction by white blood cells. This often happens through experience with the disease. The vaccine as a result gives the patient the disease, however the virus is severely weakened and in many cases dead. This makes it easy as cake for the immune system to combat the virus. Once the virus has been removed, the body has memory cells that remember these diseases, and these memory cells are what makes it so that antibodies know that something is a virus and needs to be marked for destruction. Vast oversimplification but the best I can do",nd6yyi,2021-05-23 03:54:57

There are major vaccines being distributed and very minor amount of antibody tests in comparison. It is not talked about. It’s like all or nothing.

Only people who are sick transmit the disease. So if 2 vaccinated people meet nothing happens. If a sick person meets a vaccinated person no transmitting will happen(Well it will but it wont make you sick to the point where you transmit it - by this i mean that your immune system will react to the virus before you get symptoms as it now knows how to deal with it),nd6yyi,2021-05-20 20:46:49

You are also not infected with the diseases when getting vaccinated. You are given a dead form of the virus that your body thinks is the virus and thus makes anti-bodies against the virus but you can't actually contract covid.
There is nothing else in the vaccine or it wouldn't have been approved by all of these different independent countries and medical agencies world wide. Even the Europeans approved it and they banned several foods readily available for consumption in the U.S. bc they don't see them as safe enough. So there's no worry there either.
But if you are still worried go talk to your doctor.
I'm sure it'll be hard to convince your husband. But even if he doesn't get vaccinated you can still do it yourself. It's your body after all and you're also protecting him indirectly getting vaccinated as you are protecting many people who can't get vaccinated due to precious conditions (like they might take medication that doesn't go with the vaccine, just like those people wouldn't be able to survive taking an aspirin).
I hope that helps. I can tell you that I have no reservations against getting the vaccine and will as soon as I can.",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 17:31:05
"It really is ok. There are risks inherent in everything, but as you are now seeing in your own family, the risks from actually getting covid are very serious. We aren't doing these vaccines in a vacuum--they're available because of the seriousness of this pandemic.

I am in a covid vaccine trial. My mom begged me not to do it because at the time no covid vaccines were close to approval, but it worked out and my only side effect was a sore arm. Shortly after my shot my parents got covid bad and they were so grateful that I was protected even though they had been against it. My dad and brother were long-haulers and had covid symptoms for 5 months, versus my one day of discomfort.",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 17:32:25
"I would recommend to anyone who is uncertain about getting the vaccine to learn as much about the science behind it as possible. Uncertainty comes from the unknown, so once we are able to understand how the vaccine works and why it is deemed safe, then it alleviates the fears and concerns that come naturally to anything we aren’t used to. I would also recommend reading the book The Code Breaker by Walter Isaacson. It is all about the the science behind the discoveries that eventually led to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The main character, a woman named Jennifer Doudna, is exceedingly brilliant in her field and was an integral part of putting all the pieces together. It’s a fascinating read and made me feel even better about being vaccinated.",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 20:38:54
"Yes it truly is safe and effective. I was fully vaccinated back in February and have had 0 issues. Same goes for all my friends and family who are now vaccinated. My S/O got sick before getting vaccinated and I didn't get sick from her so that was all the proof I needed that my vaccine was working as intended. There have been millions of people who are fully vaccinated and have not had side affects and the reporting methods to record symptoms are robust and make it easy to see trends in large populations. 

I highly recommend getting one so you don't have the break risk of catching the virus like you're sister-in-law. Let me know if there is any Information I  can direct you to to help answer the concerns you have :D",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 17:34:01
"Yes, you should absolutely get vaccinated. Serious adverse effects are very rare, and If you’re worried about them then you need to weigh the probability and severity of those side effects against those of the much more likely and harmful adverse effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cost/benefit analysis here is wildly tilted in favor of vaccination.",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 19:46:31
"It is really safe. Half of America has had it - I just got my 14 year old daughter vaccinated - and I follow medical research, looked at both sides. The anti vax side has a lot of fearmongering without facts, claims of problems that when you look into them don’t hold up, and quotes from real research where they blatantly lie about the result. 

Notice the moving targets? The times when it’s been said the vaccine would kill people within a month - you see half of America dead yet? It’s a well tested and excellent vaccine. The initial study participants have been vaccinated more than 6 months no, no bad effects — and for that again a massive number of people were in the study. 

And covid - it has been checked for long term effects - people who have survived Covid are turning out to have lung, heart damage. A higher rate of type 2 diabetes. It’s important to look at the impact of the disease as well.",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 21:31:34
"I want to point out something that might get you thinking:

""mRNA vaccines are new.""  No, they're not.

In fact, the very first vaccine, vaccinia (against smallpox) was an mRNA vaccine, not that Edward Jenner (who introduced vaccinia) would have known it in the 1790s.  

Vaccinia is a virus derived either from horsepox or cowpox that only causes very mild disease in humans (usually only one blister), but confers immunity against smallpox.  Vaccinia, like all poxviruses, is a DNA virus.  It infects cells and then its DNA is transcribed to mRNA and then the mRNA is translated to protein.  Those proteins trigger an immune response that is protective against all poxviruses.

In fact, all ""live attenuated"" antiviral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, rotavirus, nasal flu, yellow fever, etc.) and all viral vectored vaccines (ERVEBO against Ebola and the J&J Ad26 vectored Ebola vaccine, among others) are fundamentally mRNA vaccines.  Some of these viruses are RNA viruses, so the information flow is gRNA-->Protein or gRNA-->mRNA-->Protein.  Some are DNA viruses, so the information flow is DNA-->mRNA-->Protein.

But what they all have in common is that last step: ""mRNA-->Protein.""  

All an mRNA vaccine does is to skip the first few steps.  But it's no different than if you naturally get infected by a virus...except the mRNA vaccines do not replicate and so will not make you sick in the way SARS-CoV-2 can.  

I hope that this information leads you into a place of curiosity to learn more.  And if you approach us in good faith and ask these questions, I'll be happy to answer.

You've taken your first step into a beautiful and fascinating world.  Welcome.",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 22:08:36

I’m also not in peak shape but know someone who is sick enough with other things that they can’t get the covid vaccine. It’s best to talk to your doctor first since they will know better than folks on the internet. I recommend it if you’re able to get it.,nbk9g0,2021-05-13 22:59:06
I'm 56 with congestive heart failure and other chronic conditions. I've had both of my shots and the only side effect was a day of severe fatigue after the 2nd one.

"The shot itself is safe and at this point in time has been tested pretty extensively. The only real life threatening thing that can happen is the allergic reaction. I’d highly recommend stocking up on some Gatorade or some other sports drink with electrolytes in case you get side effects though. 

The side effects are likely to happen; they are normal and are temporary. Your body will treat the spike protein that is created because of the vaccine as if it were a disease. So it can cause an immune response. Older people tend to have it easier with side effects. Something like Tylenol or Advil can help immensely with the side effects (assuming you’re not allergic). 

I probably had one of the worst set of side effects (all of them) and still say the pros way outweigh the cons.

"Hi! I have no idea if this will help you at all, but recently a podcast I'm a fan of did an episode where one of the host's friends, a woman who has never had a vaccine in her life, spoke to an immunology expect about her concerns about the vaccine.

She has since gone on to get her first shot.

I would say to give it a listen as her concerns are ones I've heard from a lot of people online and they do generally get addressed. I am very pro-vaccine and will be getting my COVID shot as soon as I am able, but this podcast episode was really interesting to hear as someone who couldn't really relate to the woman in question. Maybe, though, it will bring you some clarity.

"I just watched a great PBS show about the history of vaccination(see link below) and how anti-vax thoughts have existed in the past, but fortunately overall vaccination has gotten past the anti-vax movement and been extremely successful around the world. I am part of one of the last generations to get the small pox vaccine, which is no longer given because small pox was eventually eradicated through the vaccination program. I annually get the flu vaccine, have had MMR vaccination, pneumonia vaccination, DPT, polio and small pox vaccines. I am 62 and in excellent health. I even ran 7 miles after getting each dose of my COVID vaccine with no problems. [https://www.pbs.org/video/vaccines-huvzkv/](https://www.pbs.org/video/vaccines-huvzkv/)   

Think about how many people have already received the vaccine. Currently 333 million people are fully vaccinated while over 1.3 billion doses have been given. There are almost no problems, with over the five months of vaccinations. 

Please do yourself, your family and friends a favor, and get vaccinated. You don't have to tell your husband. Your medical information is yours, and may be kept private even from your family. That is your right. You getting vaccinated will even help protect your husband somewhat, since you won't get COVID and bring it home to him. Good luck to you and your sister-in-law.",nbk9g0,2021-05-13 23:10:00
"I just want to say that reconsidering your anti vaxx stance is something to be proud of. 

As others have pointed out, every day life has risks and we can’t reduce those risks unless we stay home and do nothing. With COVID, we can reduce the risks by having the vaccine. 

Ingredients in vaccines sound scary and very chemically but everything is made from chemicals and have scary sounding names. Formaldehyde for instance is actually produced in our bodies and if you eat a pear, you’ve just eaten more formaldehyde than vaccines contain. 

Anti vaxxers use fear to support their claims. They talk about ‘chemicals’ and how all the side effects listed include things like ‘death’ etc. The vaccine inserts list all possible side effects but included in those lists are self reported by people who believe the reaction is vaccine related. Vaccines do have side effects and some reactions can be significant but even if there’s no relationship between the vaccine and a reaction that’s been self reported, because someone has reported it, it’s listed as a possible side effect from the vaccine. 

Even if you get the vaccine, it does not guarantee you from not getting sick from COVID but at the moment that’s our only defence against this very deadly virus. 

There is no microchip in the vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine I had, the total dose was 0.3ml - a very small volume and I had no reaction after my first dose and had a blunted taste/loss of taste of some flavours after my second dose but I feel lucky that I had the opportunity to be vaccinated. The rates of infection and death are huge, especially in places with very large populations and little opportunities for social distancing. 

I work in healthcare and I’m very pro science and I’ve even had my doubts about COVID, it’s origins and if it’s been released as population control and sometimes I worry that I might be wrong with my pro vaxx stance but I know the science isn’t actually wrong. It’s ok to have doubts and critically analyse your choices with your body but I’m glad I had the vaccine and I didn’t hesitate to receive it as soon as I could after it became available

I wish you peace with whatever decision you make and if you decide to have the vaccine, remember the majority of people have no adverse reactions to it.",nbk9g0,2021-05-14 00:00:27
"These vaccines are tested thoroughly and would not be released if they were not safe. Most aren't released for years just so we can verify their safety. 

The only one that hasn't been given the full brigade of tests yet is the Covid vaccine due to the fact that it was needed sooner than most, and that's why every reputable doctor warns you that it's not yet FDA approved and the side effects aren't 100% documented.

This doesn't mean it's dangerous or untested, it just means that the doctors behind it haven't gone to the ends of the earth to test it yet, like they do with all of the others. 

They aren't trying to poison you, microchip you, mutate you, etc. It doesn't benefit anyone to do so. You're already practically microchipped if you have any smart device, and killing off the population would hurt everybody. The heavy metals in the vaccine are in smaller doses than you'd get from eating most foods, and less than what's already in your blood, the virus inside is already dead, and if you are allergic to the shot or immunocompromised they will simply refuse to administer it.",nbk9g0,2021-05-14 00:27:28

I’m not sure why your husband’s anti vaxx, but you can check with plenty of independent sources about the safety of vaccines in general. 

As for the vaccine itself, it’s mostly biological material with some stabilizers. Most vaccines contain dead viruses; the pfizer one skipped a step in antibody creation and has the messenger RNA (mRNA) instead. it doesn’t contain fetal cells, or human biological material. it’s just floating sections of instructions for how to make antibodies.

Vaccinate, reducing your chances of getting covid to 5% and less than 1% chance of getting lethal side effects from the vaccine.

I'm a nursing student who gets fucking furious with all the people playing it down. People with covid might look good one ay, not even needing oxygen- next day they're dead. Some have to be intubated. So they're calling their relatives like ""idk if I will wake up, no you can't visit. I love you"" and then sometimes it ends well and sometimes it doesn't.
and NOT only old people. The patient average age is now 50-65 or something. 

Most younger people between 20-40 rarely die, but strokes happen a lot. Also the lung tissue gets destroyed that much, many young people suffer from chronic shortness of breath after covid.

"Someone [already wrote one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7956899/?report=classic), isn’t that nice.  It’s actually a pretty short article, more of a letter or short review type of deal.  But it’s a great summary.  As for my background, it’s computer science and math.  I work as a computational biologist though.  

This paragraph deals with long term use of mRNA (testing has been around for a decade).  Use in other vaccines, cancer treatments, anti-fungals, etc.  
> Although there are no previously approved mRNA vaccines, these vaccines have been trialed in humans for oncologic therapies for nearly a decade (NCT01684241), and have been trialed in humans for infectious disease for over 3 years.6 Regarding adverse events, data from phase I influenza mRNA vaccine and phase III COVID-19 mRNA vaccine trials have demonstrated that injection site pain, erythema, swelling, fever, fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, and arthralgia are more common in the vaccine group relative to placebo.3 , 4 , 6 These events are consistent with reactogenicity, which is expected after immune system instigation.

They have a single sentence about long term effects due to it being mRNA.  It doesn’t last long enough in the body to really do anything.  mRNA in general is a middle-step when it comes to transcribing DNA and as such it doesn’t linger and is kind of destroyed and broken up since it’s not super stable anyways.  

> Furthermore, long-term adverse effects are unlikely mechanistically, because mRNA does not persist for an extended period of time or integrate into chromosomes.",nbk9g0,2021-05-19 01:50:58

Same thing:your agenda makes no sense. Why kill us? Maybe they are giving us some kind of immunity to something they will release later to get rid of the ones that know the ""truth"" (you), so only a smaller number of people will die and they will have absolute control over everyone with smaller, near inexistent, chances of rebellious free tinkers like yourself.",nabdsz,2021-05-15 03:19:21

"Wow, I can relate so much with many things you are saying. It's unbelievable how much of false information and misunderstanding about how a vaccine works is belived by our own parents and don't realize how wrong they are. My mother told me that if i got vaccinated, she would send me to my father's house (they are divorced). And when I confronted her by explaning how the vaccine works and how false is the information she's believing, she asked me if I was already vaccinated because ""they"" are already controlling me. 
At least I came with a final conclusion that is going to prove that what she's believing is not true, I asked her if she thinks that the pandemic is going to end and all humanity is going to return to normality, she told me that: no because Christ is going to come for us before that. And then I said: what happens if after 2023 all things return to normality and nothing you said happens? Se replied with: then the bible is good for nothing and you can use it as toilet paper.
Now I have to wait some years before I can prove her that she's wrong and her ""research"" from Facebook is not something you can trust and impose to you children.
My only advise here is that you should select a specific point in time that proves her wrong and you as the right one without fighting for who is right or wrong, let time do it's job",n9sjw1,2021-05-11 13:04:32
"Hey there! That sounds like it is really hard to deal with and have to be around constantly. Are you holding up ok? Props to you for reaching out to grandma for help. I’m sure she’s not super pleased with how her daughter is acting. What I find to be most helpful when interacting with people who hold differing views, wrongfully so or not, is to try and be respectful and empathetic. Obviously they are scared(mostly irrational fears) so being super confrontational and always trying to point out where they are wrong will put them on the defensive and s gauge more of a flight or fight response. I like to ask how they explain what is going on and try to get an explanation that makes sense to just have them try and follow their train of thought out loud. Questions their sources and try and point out the shortcoming like, is the author someone who is qualified to talk on the subject? What evidence does the opposing argument have?

Luckily you have a few more year before you can be further removed from your situation so trying to be non-confrontational might be less stressful for you. Hang in there and keep trying to fight the good fight. We must accept that there are things outside our control and best wishes so we must focus on what we can directly control!",n9sjw1,2021-05-11 12:35:59

There is a huge difference in being apprehensive about these vaccines and being against all vaccines. Is it okay to be worried and question the long term effects of the covid vaccines? Absolutely. If you are worried is it ok to wait? Sure. Should you actively lie and spew nonsense trying to convince others not to take it? No way.,n9sjw1,2021-05-11 17:04:08

Dude. It’s up to you eat you want. Just make your decision and stick with it. Just don’t be a prick to your parents. If you have kids how would you feel if they went against your wishes. They are still technically your guardian... what’s wrong with waiting till your 18? Statistically younger people are not likely to get severely sick. Is it really that hard to wait?

I am legitimately in the exact same position right now. Except my mom doesnt even know. In a few months time if she doesnt get my opinion im sure she will flip out.

I feel you. Honestly i do. I feel the exact same way. I feel like the only thing you honestly CAN do is stay low. Dont talk about anything related to that. Let it calm down hopefully. And hopefully you wont have to deal with it much longer. I hope they back off. And i hope it doesnt stress you out too much. You are doing great so dont worry.,n9sjw1,2021-05-22 01:48:51

"Thanks man, honestly i’ve been dealing with this type of stuff from my mom for years. Shes diagnosed with depression and is a heavy narcissist, along with multiple other things. Throughout my life there have been moments where I truly question her state of mind and stability. Me and my step dad have always been able to talk about some of the stuff she has done and said and we always agreed together that she was far far in the wrong. So I think what bugs me the most is that he’s not taking my side on this when I know he is smart enough to know that what she and part of the world is saying is utter bullshit. It’s almost scary because he’s always been able to just ignore her while she’s trying to basically manipulate him to thinking exactly like her, but this time I have no one but my grandmother and my boyfriend on my side. 

And about confrontation and like asking- just why and how do you think this-  I honestly have no plans on correcting her on this face to face. Ive only really stood up to her, with this topic, once and that was what made me write this. I am terrified of that woman and she won’t change no matter what I tell her. The more and more I am right, the more and more i’m “wrong” to her. There’s no winning sadly. But thank you for all the advice",n9sjw1,2021-05-11 13:28:24

"As someone who grew up with a narcissistic mom - RUN as far away as you can soon as you are able. It'll be hard at first and you will be tempted to go back (narcs are great at baiting you back in with arguments, gifts, manipulation etc) but your 35 year old self will thank you when you're not spending those years sorting through the wreckage of your life while your friends are having kids, building careers, etc. Trust me, I'm that 35 year old. 

Never correct a narcissist, you will not win and you will likely provoke some type of abuse. Watch everything you can from ""Dr. Ramani."" You'll be ok, but you have to minimize the damage by staying as far away as possible, emotionally and physically.",n9sjw1,2021-05-13 04:23:32

"I know smoking weed sounds bad, since I am underage I understand the concern along with a huge family history of addiction. My dads side loved the hard drugs and well so did my moms side. 

And I did too for a while. My favorites are xanax and adderall, and every once in a while I still get some just to feel normal. Adderall is the only thing that makes me feel focused, attentive but not to attentive so that I fixate on things, and it’s the only thing that calms my body down. (Whenever i’m awake i’m constantly shaking because of my adhd, and probably anxiety/ticks.) 

I am supposed to be prescribed it but I won’t let them, I don’t trust myself with pills because a history of fucked overdoses and bad choices shows me i’m not responsible enough to be given pills. 

So I smoke weed because it’s the only thing comparable to what I need. And I can’t overdose, I can’t get “too fucked up” or anything. I just get to hungry sometimes. 

Again I understand being concerned but i’m as responsible as I can be. I only smoke at home really and I don’t drive because I don’t have a license yet.

Oh and no the only other outlet I had was self harm, alcohol and coke and obviously that is something I try my hardest to stay away from",n9sjw1,2021-05-11 14:30:46
"First, there is no proof that the vaccine causes any of that. Second, no one is forcing you to get the vaccine.

"I don’t know how i’ve held it together as well as I do but I have to. I want as least drama as I can but the only way I can do do that with her is just well don’t show emotion, but don’t be sad. don’t talk to much but if your just silent she’ll be mad because she’ll think your ignoring her and don’t move to much but if you don’t move at all, you’ll be in her way somehow or my favorite “wow you haven’t gotten up in a while, you really should, it shows” talking about my weight. and she does that with anyone, she will judge someone she has never met straight to there face and act like what she said shouldn’t have offended anyone, like how dare you be mad at me?

"I’ve known that she hasn’t treated me right since we moved in the with my brothers dad. He was an alcoholic piece of shit.. and she drank to keep up with him. 

Every night was exactly the same. We had to be in bed by 8 so he could bust out his vodka and her beer. I of course was never asleep by 8, I just sat in my room and waited for everything to be over because I knew I wouldn’t have been able to sleep. and my brother was a baby baby so he didn’t know what was going on and slept through everything thank god. 

He would usually put a movie on and start watching it and about half way through my mom would say something off and he’d get mad. And he was a really scary man. He would beat my mom and then when she was in the living room just sitting on the couch after, he would tell her he’s going to bed. 

It would be like 11 by then, and he would come into my room. That’s all i’m saying for privacy reasons but seeing that he was an abusive drunk, and he didn’t see me as family. I think you know where that went. I don’t know if she was just so drunk that she never saw it happening or did and didn’t remembered it but I would think that even after drinking a few beers (because she never had over 4 beers) you’d realize what was happening or, maybe she just didn’t care but yeah after that I never really saw her as a mom, I couldn’t. I acted very open and happy but really I was a very closed off child.

But yeah point is that my moms never given a shit about me- or even tried to make it seem like she does. She’s so abusive and since we left him, it’s only gotten worse. 

But even after that, I’m not telling any doctor about any abuse. I much, much rather wait a year, my boyfriend turns 18 and he’s renting a studio apt. and I plan on just staying there. I won’t be 18 yet but I seriously doubt my mom will care. She’s let my drop out and work, she considers me as an adult already. I mean I pay rent.",n9sjw1,2021-05-11 15:25:00

"Thank you, honestly I might dm you occasionally because it’s nice to actually get everything off my chest to a real person and not something the meows back.. 

And yeah since 6th grade i’ve been just barely holding on to even going to school. And then freshman year started, and a lot of shit happened, at that point I had been homeless for a little under 3 years. I skipped every single class I could without them calling home, I begged for in schools and after school. I couldn’t focus because of my anxiety and adhd. 

I had all Fs and they told I had failed and I had to go to a different school and I just never did. I enrolled myself, and then found out it was online, and never once opened up the computer. I think they think I moved because I just never showed up for anything. And my mom told me that she just won’t enroll me next year and see what happens. 

I do have a plan for the future. I’m not just dropping out. I do plan to get my GED and then go to a trade school, i’m a great mechanic and I plan to use that to get me a great job. I’m gonna try my hardest to get a job a dealership because they do a lot of programs with students and I can make decent money while I’m in trade school.

After I finish trade school, I wanna go to a community college to get all the dumb classes out so I don’t have to pay an arm and leg for everything. I plan to go to a college, I wanna get my business license so that when I have enough money saved up from working in the dealership, I can rent out a car garage and start my own business. 

My entire family on my step dads side are mechanics so I’ll have a lot of help along the way.",n9sjw1,2021-05-11 15:59:23

They refer to their own previous work that claims to show that the spike protein activates signaling pathways in cultured cells, then basically wave their hands and say, ""One can imagine a possible universe where spike protein introduced to skeletal muscle tissue may induce the same sort of cell signaling that may cause thickening of pulmonary arteries or other bad lung and/or heart things in lung and heart tissue, and therefore we should watch out for vaccines potentially causing these bad things.""",n5oh3b,2021-05-05 21:35:08

"I'm concerned as well. I have a bachelors in biotechnology and am in graduate school for a masters in biotech.

From my research, there are also concerns spike protein can cross the placenta. A pregnant woman in brazil died after getting the vaccination.

Also- the clinical trials are great. Let people volunteer for them. But don not let the government push you into doing something by saying vaccienes are ""PROVEN SAFE"". They're not. They've only recieved emergency use authorization through the FDA. That is all. This societal pressure is basically peer pressure.

My concern exists about the potential of spike protein to cause complications down the line. Most of the vaccinated are elderly and not in the childbearing age. I worry those who are younger and vaccinated may have issues with infertility and birth defects. A similar thing happened when pregnant mothers were treated with estrogen in the 1950s to prevent abortion- 20 years later, the children they were carrying had rare forms of cervical cancer due to the inutero exposure to estrogen, which was proven ineffective at preventing abortion in clinical trials anyway.

Also- I'm concerned at the fact they're eagerly vaccinating those who have prior infections. I have previously been infected with covid and do not want to get the vacciene until there are evidence based practice guidelines and studies have been done on the effects of vaccination on those who have already had the infection.

I fear something like the thalidomide epidemic could occur(mass birth defects in children of vaccinated mothers or health conseuences ears down the line). In 10 years, I may get the vacciene.

Its easier for everyone to write us off as 'crazy antivaxers who married our cousin and drink busch light chainsmoke in the trailers and watch nascar' than it is for them to acknowledge our numerous and legitimate concerns.",n5oh3b,2021-05-21 21:36:04

"I don't know what they are doing, honestly. They don't present any evidence that the spike protein by itself can cause any harm. They basically say that because the spike protein can activate (*in vitro*, anyway) some signalling pathways that may be necessary for things like arterial thickening to occur then it may be possible that the protein by itself can cause these things in the body. But there's no evidence that this can actually happen and plenty of good reason to doubt it. There's just no more reason to take this claim seriously than the idea that it will give you mad cow disease or something.

How about learning how science works before blindly believing anything mainstream(not even scientists) say about it:

How about learning or relearning statistics as well to understand how people are biased.  
Sample: Two groups of 1000 people  
Control group receives drug  
Placebo group receives saline water  
1 people in control group dies (but 999 are drugged, and lots have side effect)  
2 people in placebo group dies (zero drug side effect on 998 alive)  


Relative news: drugs reduces cardiac mortality in 50%  
Relative news 2: 200% more cardiac death on group without drugs

Absolute news: 1000 cardiac person treated to save one of two  
Absolute news 2: cardiac drug real efficacy of 0.05%

Remember we have an immune system and there's a basic about it(terrain theory):

I just don’t think we should be assuming one absolutely massive group that makes up the majority of the left and right are of the same mindset.

The thing is they want you to get the vaccine and the best way for you to track that you have both doses is if you get microchipped.
 
 Reason for the microchip? Because they want to cashless society to put one inside of you hence why covid exists. You claim physical money is spreading it, take microchips and use it as the only currency to buy or sell with and next thing you know you have a mark of the beast and your right hand and forehead. Let's not forget there are plenty of people with RFID chips and their right hand buying things AS WE SPEAK. 

 Why do you think certain parts of the country are making people wear these dumbass bracelets. Also look at Israel you need an app in order to get in most stores now that prove your vaccinations. In the Bible it speaks in Revelations that you will not be able to buy or sell without the mark of the beast which will be on your right hand and forehead.

"My ex's father survived polio as a child and walked with a limp for the rest of his life, along with daily pain. He told me his growth was also stunted from it (he was maybe 5 feet tall as an adult).

My father-in-law also is a polio survivor, but the effects he has from it are worse. He lost about 45% of the use of his left side. About three years ago, he was diagnosed with [Post Polio Syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Post-Polio-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet). He has now lost the use of his left hand and most of his forearm, he is losing stability with his left leg, and has a slew of other health complications.

For many, polio isn't a disease that you have and get over, never having to think about it again. There can be be life-long complications that come from it that get worse with age.",n0neub,2021-04-29 12:46:35
"Polio is not eradicated, it still spreads in certain parts of the world, if it was eradicated the vaccine would be unnecessary

"My grandpa had a sister who died of polio when she was 11. My great uncle posted about it on Facebook a couple weeks ago in response to all of the anti vax stuff going around. I guess some of his friends got the disease and died too. I knew one guy who had it. My cousins grandpa. He had a limp and scars on his face from measles. He died in like 2008 or something. But I was so scared of him. I remember hiding behind my mom and having her take me outside and say ""you know how blessed you are to live in this day and age where no one gets these illnesses anymore?"" I was still kind of freaked out by him even after just because I was a kid, but I never cried during another vaccination. 

My exes family was anti vax and when I found out he had never had a shot I remembered my cousins grandpa's face and I was so horrified I was scared to touch him. 😂 of course that was stupid  and I know now that if he had measles I most likely wouldn't get it and I'd be able to tell if someone had it! 

My grandpa died long before I was born but my grandma told me that he had gone to basic training for the military or something like that and when he came back someone in his town said they were sorry about his sister and he knew right when they said that, that she had gotten polio and died. She said that he ran to the cemetery and saw her grave and that's how he found out she died. According to my grandma he had gotten mad and yelled at her before he left so the last thing he had said to her wasn't nice. She said it haunted him for the rest of his life. 

I sometimes get really sad when I see people irl and online not vaccinating their kids. If polio came back it would be so horrible. I'd rather have covid 10 times than ever have polio. Anti vaxxers don't know what a real pandemic looks like thanks to vaccines.",n0neub,2021-04-29 06:05:56

We don’t know if the vaccine carries out an extremely long term side effect, but we have a very good idea on what it will do. Since COVID is similar to other diseases, most notably the SARS virus, we had a bit of a head start with creating the vaccine. Once we created it, we still tested on tens of thousands of people for around 6 months to make sure it doesn’t have any immediate side effects and after the rollout, a close eye will still be kept on the vaccine.

"When you get infected with rabies, the virus will travel through your nervous system into the brain. It might take up to years to develop symptoms, often with victims brushing off the zero day infections as something insignificant and being unaware of the incident. Very little virus is required because it will multiply extremely fast once you are infected.

The time bomb has been set.

With rabies once you start showing symptoms, it is already too late; your brain and nervous system has been taken over and you will die slowly and painfully. You will not be able to drink anything due to hydrophobia, due to painful spasms occuring when trying to consume liquid. You will likely be paralyzed during this whole thing. But you will be conscious up until the second you succumb to your death.

There has been only *one* human that has survived rabies without getting a vaccine, by being put in a coma. And she only made a *partial recovery*.

However, the antivax group I was in turned into an anti-mask, COVID-19 conspiracy group. The group already had some conspiracies that I thought were ridiculous, like Bill Gates is evil, New World Order, Agenda 21, etc. Many of them also thought that vaccines were actually meant to decrease the population. The theory was that the severe adverse effects killed children and adults, and the ones that survived would be more prone to SIDS and autism. They also thought the HPV vaccine would sterilize people. COVID-19 just became another insane theory.

Additionally, the vast majority of the members were ultra-conservative, religious, anti-abortion Trump supporters, which is pretty much the exact opposite of my beliefs, so I already felt like I didn't fit in.

">A person who believes vaccines are harmful

Hi, /u/RichardK1234 

**I don't to be an anti-vaxxer** but sadly I am one now. This is now the generally accepted definition of anti-vaxxer: a person who opposes vaccination or **laws that mandate vaccination** 
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anti-vaxxer


I don't think vaccines are harmful in general. Had a bunch. If I got bit by a raccoon, I would drive immediately to the ER and let the staff do their thing.
 
But I oppose laws that mandate **this vaccine.** So being anti-vaxx can be an opinion, the same as other opinions on other laws, policies and mandates. **Once we bring man made laws into it it's not about science it's about politics and what we as Citizens want. It's about our rights** It's about forcing people to engage in medical services or being fined or shunned from society. CoV is real. And so is the police officer enforcing the laws of the majority. 


I think mixing the two together (putting vaccinations and the laws requiring vaccination is wrong and wish they were separated. Let me ask you a few questions:

* Are you anti-surgery? Do you oppose surgeries or laws that mandate you to have surgery?
* Are you anti-alcohol? Do you opposed drinking alcohol or laws that mandate you to drink alcohol?
* Are you anti-company Christmas parties? Do you oppose Christmas parties or mandates that force you to attend company Christmas parties?
* Are you anti-Islam? Do you oppose Islam or laws that force you to convert to Islam?
* Are you anti-Veganism? Do you oppose Veganism or laws that force you to become Vegan?
* Are you anti-tattooes? Do you oppose tattooes or laws that force you to receive a tattoo?


**If you answered yes to any one of those ....you are an anti-XXXX.**

To me it comes down to this: What about laws that apply to other people? Laws that force surgery, prohibition, forced conversions? What can I legally force you to do with your body? If you could vote on it, what control would you like politicians, and policy makers to have over it? Which political party do you wish to have control over what gets injected into you?

We are dealing with peoples rights and what goes into their body. Considering that we are dealing with experimental vaccines and a ton of misinformation, it's fair to say many people are hesitant.

We have to be very cautious and forward thinking on how or what rights we surrender.

Most of the teachers love boasting about how they never get vaccinated. Of course, the students believe the same. If you try to say anything different, they will tear you apart

Anti-vax idealogy is very common in Christian religious circles. They tend to not believe science since science says their god is fake and ""conveniently"" supports a lot of liberal belief.

Bleeding wounds do carry a risk as well! While bleeding does decrease the risk (especially on  shallower wounds), that doesn't mean it isn't impossible to get tetanus. Deep wounds and puncture wounds from a dirty object still carry a high risk for it.

Plus, I didn't say tetanus vaccine (though the kid didn't receive the vaccine before hand, so it would be wise to get it to prevent tetanus in the future), I said tetanus shot. As in Anti-Tetanus Immune globulin (TIg), the ""antitoxin"" (most people say antitoxin in reference to the animal shot, but same difference!) which is given either by injection or IV.

"First and foremost, I'm a guy, please and thank you! And yes, I should have been more clear, so let me clarify. 

An anti-vax/anti-shot mother I knew never gave her kids tetanus shots, among many other important vaccinations. Even after her child cut herself on a very dirty object, she didn't get her child the anti-toxin, nor vaccinate her child(ren) against future injuries (many doctors recommend booster shots if it's been more than five years since a vaccination, I'm sure they would've been upset to hear the children had never been vaccinated at all). 

Tetanus can have a mortality rate of 5-60% (depending on the severity) when left untreated, and I just feel like it's an irresponsible decision, especially when one works on a farm (as animal feces are common hosts for tetanus spores!!).",mz9e6a,2021-05-05 02:33:09

Agenda 2021 and Agenda 2030 are the NWO in your face, most countries signed and follow same rules, it's the NWO.   
Look the measures around countries regarding Covid-19 and the mainstream saying same things, propagating fear at population, like NPC's following a script.  


Being anti-vax or pro-vax means zero, if the one mentioned is just following the herd like you were doing, instead of researching and following things because of your health. You were trying to find a friend group to be welcomed. (Avoid taking it personal, but if you want to know the truth or the better for you, you need to do it for yourself without the need, attention, acceptance of other).  


An idea or thinking is true or false, independently of people agreeing with you, finding people who agree with you may comfort, but that's just it.  


Most vaccines are unnecessary for lots, like pharmacy drugs. Some might be helpful, for emergencies.  


Some vaccines, like the formers for smallpox may be good, but one thing being good is different of all things of same kind being good.  


There's lot of information people here lack around vaccines, but still defends all of them without knowing the adverse effects typed in drugs leaflet, let alone those out of the paper in front of each eyes.  


IMO: Main vaccine problems are toxic components, which could be replaced but aren't because of profit of big industries and lobby(lobism).  
Second main problem, when they're given to babies, even before first milk where the baby gets its colostrum, monolaurin and second touch of immune system in case it's a natural birth.  


There'd be lots of less anti-vaccine was above two topics fixed.

">There are some cases where specialized treatment in the ICU saves someone, but that is not the norm, and can still leave you with neurological problems

I'm sorry if I come off as harsh, but I don't think you really grasp the mortality rate of rabies.

Only one known person in the *entire human history* has survived rabies after symptoms kicked in. Only ONE. And she didn't even fully recover. It was probably 1 in a ten million chance or some astronomical fucking coincidence. If you end up in an ICU with rabies diagnosed, you are basically a dead man walking.

"First of all, it's not even a new normal. In Japan, people regularly wear masks if they are sick. 

Second of all, the 'crtics' the sub offers is mostly misinformation and overreaction. They undermine the effects of covid on people who are suffering from it. 

Although not much, the critical information that does appear about vaccines are overreactions. People already know vaccines aren't perfect, but the sub outright disregards it. 

Sometimes the information on that sub is outright false. Like 'if a vaccine/vaccinated person can still spread the disease then it's not a vaccine'. No, that's completely wrong. That's not what a vaccine is. If I find a link to that 'meme' I'll edit it in later.

"I'm quoting someone from my school actually. I do understand that many Christians/Catholics do not think this way, but I have met many who do. 

In my knowledge and experience of Christians/Catholics, the general idea that modern science isn't accurate/is political stems from the notion that science must only prove their specific beliefs. In more traditional religious circles, these are often right-wing ideals. If science says that X is or isn't true, when one thinks the opposite, then science must be wrong. Otherwise, their belief system isn't infallible. 

Now replace 'X' with things like evolution and belief that everything evolved over time instead of being created by god all at once (e.g. every human stemmed from Adam and Eve), climate change, dinosaurs, carbon dating, the general age of the world and things in it, the possibility of life in space, popular theories like the Big Bang Theory contradicting Genesis, anthropology contradicting Biblical stories/relics, atheism, science and modern medicine (abortion, organ donation, contraceptives, vaccines, transition surgery and hrt, \[in some cases\] mental illness, etc.), the science supporting that being LGBT+ isn't a choice/is normal, COVID, the fact that there isn't much (if any) physical, wide-believed, scientific proof of the existence of an omnipotent, invisible being, and so on. 

I have found that many religions (but this is mostly directed to Catholicism) tend to make science political. Again, I understand that this isn't the belief of the majority, but just a rather loud minority in the circles I am often around (as my family consists of Trad-Catholics and will only associate with such). But those that do think this way tend to get under my skin easily.",mz9e6a,2021-04-28 15:08:13

"My parents (and extended family aside from a couple of people) are Trad-Catholics, and only associate with such. I have to do Catholic school courses and I'm pretty much never allowed to hang out with non-Catholic people. 
From my parents, from their friends, from teachers, and students, I have to deal with that awful minority every day and it's incredibly hard on me. 

From casual racism, homophobia, and stupidity, to physical violence (e.g. one of my parents' closest friends have a kid who is openly trans. They beat her and are trying to send her to conversion therapy. Everyone treats it as a reasonable response. I'm a closeted trans guy, I can't even begin to explain the fear I constantly feel.) and sexual assault coverups (e.g my brother sexually assaulted my sister when she was about seven, guess who is studying for the priesthood now!) it's very easy to find bigotry in the Church.

I have countless examples of these sorts of people, and maybe it's because I'm taught that you aren't Catholic if you don't act like this, it's hard to believe that it's a minority. Look at all the child abuse cover ups, look at all the homophobia, transphobia, and racism. It's mostly religious folk standing at the edge of pride parades screaming that you deserve to go to hell, it's religious folk calling you a murderer for abortions and birth control, it's religious folk passing laws to deny you healthcare for being trans, or barring you from the military, or criminalizing women's clinics, or attempting to remove anti-discrimination laws, or condemning suicide hotlines.

I'm just sixteen and I can't keep dealing with this for much longer, y'know? But oh wait, I'll go to hell for that too because mental illness is another fucking sin.

"I think a large majority of current anti vaxxers were fully vaccinated as kids. Then the internet happened and this belief that there are more than one set of facts or that two sides to a debate should be given equal time. 

Evolution is scientific fact, but people confuse the scientific definition of the word theory with the ordinary usage of the word. This is how we get into the situation that we should present both sides and let the kids decide.

97% of scientists agree that human factors in climate change is a thing, but all debates you see on news programs give equal time, making it appear there is equal evidence.

There is no demonstrable causal link between vaccination and issues. Take the J&J vaccine. You actually have a higher risk of forming a blood clot just by getting older than the percentage of cases of the vaccine.

"My parents are very pro vaccine and so is most of my siblings (myself included). I grew up learning about vaccines and why they're important, I've never once thought that they're bad because my parents showed me the research of vaccines at a young age. I'm in nursing school currently and can't for the life of me understand why anyone is against vaccines. My uncle who is my doctor is very pro vaccine but his daughter is anti vaccine. When she had her first kid she was saying she wouldn't vaccinate him because of ""how it leads to autism"". My uncle in front of everyone got upset and explained who that's not true, and that every single person in the room (there was about 30 of us) are fully vaccinated and not autistic. My other uncle has a child who is autistic and he got upset at my cousin for acting as if someone being autistic is bad. I really think the reason why we are seeing more and more anti vaxx people is because they believe they've ""done the research"" more than the scientists. I also blame Qanon for a lot of it because it's all fear based. ""Don't vaccinate your kid or they'll be autistic"" ""don't vaccinate your kid or they'll be chipped"" ""look at all these injuries that the vaccine causes, you're hurting your kid.""

There was no Google or Internet for people to (mis) use to decide pro or con anything, you had to rely on the experts in your life to tell you what the science said. Every pediatrician in town said ""vaccinate"", so that's what we did. It didn't even occur to any of us to second-guess our pediatrician.

Of course, this was right after the last polio epidemic in the United States, the one that the Salk vaccine ended, so people were inclined to be vaccinated anyhow. Nobody wanted to be the one whose kid ended up in an iron lung for life or, worse, died. We also got vaccinated against smallpox back then, which was a truly dangerous vaccine, but smallpox was even more deadly than the vaccine so. Nobody would tolerate the dangers of the smallpox vaccine today, which was a weakened version of a similar (but not as deadly) virus that made many kids very, very sick and even killed a few kids every year. But nobody questioned it, because the memory of epidemics past had not yet left the public conciousness, and there was no Internet to tell anybody how dangerous that vaccine really was.",myd9ky,2021-04-26 00:03:53

I know my mother had an interest in alternative medicine, but never expressed any distrust in conventional medicine besides a dislike of antibiotics. She passed away when I was 16, to be honest if she was still alive today I wouldn’t be at all surprised if she was anti-vax. I believe her interest in alternative medicine would have been accelerated by the internet and pushed her towards the anti vaccine camp. 

My father trusts medicine, even though he was hurt when a bowel operation went badly. He has no issues with a vaccine. It’s simply no big deal, and this is exactly my thoughts towards it. 

Interestingly though, I have an older brother who is anti vaccine. Same parents, same upbringing, yet he doesn’t want the vaccine. He was badly affected by an acne medication many years ago which still causes many issues now. This caused a massive distrust of conventional medicine. I have seen him slip deeper into conspiratorial thinking rabbit holes over the years, when talk of vaccines first started I knew he was going to refuse it. 

I am one of 5 kids, he is the only one that is refusing the vaccine.

"When I was a kid, whether or not vaccines are safe was never a question. Getting vaccines was just part of life, like going to school and learning to drive.

When I was in high school, there was a whooping cough outbreak there. My high school alone reported 75% of the whooping cough cases in our major metropolitan county for that year. The county department of health sent vaccinators to our high school and I got my dtap vaccine in my school gym on my 18th birthday. I was excited when they came to our school; I felt like I was in good hands.

I started graduate school, studying biology, right around when the the antivax movement blew up. I was working in a hospital and every year, the hospital would organize a vaccination drive for hospital staff and people in the academic program I was in. I started feeling proud every year when I got my flu shot because I felt like I was performing a public service. To me, the shot meant that I was protecting the people around me -- the hospital staff with less access to good healthcare and all of the people who volunteered as participants in my research studies.

Last summer, I cut my finger pretty badly on an aluminum can lid. I was freaking out because I thought I was behind on my tetanus shots. But when I got to the emergency room, they old me that I was up-to-date. Out of curiosity, I asked them how they knew that, and they old me the county has a database with that information in there.

I came out completely self-sufficient and I no longer show autistic traits because of all the behavioral modification and sensory therapy that my mother got training for in hopes she could undo the damage and give me some semblance of a normal life.

Finally I turned 27 and after all this time of silently blaming herself, she finally asked me if I resented her for getting me vaccinated. I said, ""Thank god you did because I rather be Autistic than dead."" I gave her a hug and told her she was a good mother.

Then I gave her shit about me not being circumcised by a Jewish, male doctor. Thank god one came by to fix it.

Mostly because every comment you made make you seem that you're basically pandering to the anti-vaxx which every comment seems to be like ""Oh I'm pro-vaxx but..."" plus it also seem that you always think that autism is a disease that need to be cured to which it's not a disease but rather a disorder and it don't need to be ""cured"" but rather they should be accommodated to the wider society like those who are either blind or death.

 Another example of both sides being wrong is the fact that no study claiming vaccines to cause autism was well designed, but at the same time no study has ever been done prove vaccines do not cause autism, so both sides are saying misinformation about the science on vaccines and autism.

That's a lie as they're been countless of studies that proven time and time again, they're been NO link between getting a vaccine and autism especially when they received the MMR vaccine which is the vaccine of contention. Zero, in fact there's a good page on the CDC debunking this motion: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html).

Oh and by the way, I actually did visit and join your r/VaccineDiscussion and in my opinion, I have to leave after a few days because I realized that the subreddit is nothing but an echo-chamber for anti-vaxxers, vaccine hesitancy and even vaccine alarmism to which all are nothing but dangerous. Sure, they're nothing wrong with being skeptic to vaccinations or even expressing concerns about the vaccine itself (for example the issue of blood clotting in the Astra Zeneca vaccine to which in my opinion are overly exaggerated and the fact that the risk of blood clot in receiving the vaccine are extremely rare).

For example in accordance to this [press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-new-advice-concluding-a-possible-link-between-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-and-extremely-rare-unlikely-to-occur-blood-clots) issue by the  Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), out of 20.2 million doses of AstraZeneca given in the UK, 79 developed blood clots and out of those 79, 19 died which work out to 0.0004% of the population would developed blood clots and out of the 0.0004% of the population developed blood clots, 25% of that population would die which means that because of the risk is so low, it's worth it because the benefits greatly outweighed the risk. 

Now, I made this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineDiscussion/comments/mijgaa/why_is_people_dying_in_norwaydenmarkiceland_of/gt5dc4t?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and expressing why the claims of deaths in Norway, Denmark  or Iceland who received the AstraZeneca vaccine are nothing but odd considering that in my home country, Trinidad and Tobago, actually using the AstraZeneca vaccine and so far, they're been no cases of blood clots that I'm aware however your comments of saying "" Trinidad and tobago is so small they might not notice rare side effects, it is easier to find rare side effects in a large population."" sort of rub me the wrong way admittedly speaking. Now I did comment back why this is not true and actually it's easier to notice rare side effects in a small populated country as with larger populated countries that tended to go unreported or underreported but your comment just rub me the wrong way. I even given you benefit of the doubt but it just seem odd to me. 

Now, I'm not saying that you're an anti-vaxxer and the fact that you were formerly anti-vax but now pro-vax is actually great and progress but please stop with this pandering to the anti-vaxxers that I'm seeing lately. Healthy skepticism is fine, showing genuine concerns is fine but pandering to movement that is known to be anti-science, sharing or believing in anti-vaxx conspiracy theories and can't even have a simple or rational discussion about anything is a huge no, no and honestly just doing more harm than good.",myd9ky,2021-04-27 05:41:30

"There are no antivaxers on this sub, so you never see me arguing against them, on other subs (eg r/DebateVaccines) you will see me argue against antivaxers

As for autism, I have autism and know from personal experience that accommodations by society won't fix all the problems autistic people face

>That's a lie as they're been countless of studies that proven time and  time again, they're been NO link between getting a vaccine and autism  especially when they received the MMR vaccine which is the vaccine of  contention. Zero, in fact there's a good page on the CDC debunking this motion: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html).

The MMR autism thing was a hoax, but the DTP (now changed to DTaP) vaccine was the original vaccine with eh autism controversy, and that has never been studied for autism

>Oh and by the way, I actually did visit and join your [r/VaccineDiscussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineDiscussion/)  and in my opinion, I have to leave after a few days because I realized  that the subreddit is nothing but an echo-chamber for anti-vaxxers,

There was a recent influx of antivaxers, and I had to change the rules to stop it from becoming an echo chamber, I never meant for this to be an antivax sub

As for the Astrazenaca thing, basic math tells you that an extremely rare side effect is more likely to be detected in a large population, I'm not sure why you have an issue with this, I'm saying the reactions are extremely rare which is why they don;t show up in small populations

>please stop with this pandering to the anti-vaxxers that I'm seeing lately.

"Let's throw herd immunity out the window, right? For fuck sakes if your vaccine is so good, it should stop my coronavirus from harming you. We aren't talking about the bubonic plague here, it's a virus with a high survival rate.",mxbodo,2021-04-24 08:14:08
What about people with a history of serious adverse events to vaccines? Do they not matter? What about my grandma who died within 2 weeks of her 2nd Covid jab? What about all the death reports that are being censored all over social media and the death reports which never made it from v-safe to VAERS? What about the fact that less than 1% of all adverse vaccine effects are even actually reported??,mxbodo,2021-04-24 13:50:41
"Where exactly did they insult you? I understand words are hard but I’m pretty sure they were referring to the other users username, pretty sure you just outed yourself as a moron who was arguing out of their league and needed an easy way out.

By the way, you clearly don’t love your country or it’s people if something as small as precautions against a pandemic are this much of a bother to you.",mxbodo,2021-04-24 19:49:30
"Lmao you're forgetting that herd immunity only works if everyone has it, you're trying to use herd immunity while actively detracting from it. You're forgetting about all the immunocompromised people you could infect and that's something any business deserves to know if they employ immunocompromised people",mxbodo,2021-04-24 08:15:45
"Ideally, vaccine passports would also be issued to those with genuine health issues who cannot get a vaccine, since the primary goal is to protect them. 

I'm sorry about your grandma, but it is very unlikely that the vaccine killed her, or any of the others whose deaths are supposedly being censored. When we lose someone we love, there is no way to have a truly rational conversation putting things in context, and I am sorry for worsening your pain. But I have lost people to covid, and have immediate family with long-term effects, and the vaccine is very dear to me for the same reason. They stopped the rollout of J&J in the US because one person died, so forgive me for not buying into the conspiracy that thousands of people are dropping dead from the vaccine and nothing is happening. Sometimes people just die, in unexpected and tragic ways.",mxbodo,2021-04-24 14:01:52
"That's why people who have a legitimate medical exemption would get a ""passport"" that would say so. It's for those people who legitimately cannot get the vaccine that everybody who can get it needs to. Herd immunity is to protect those that can't get the vaccine, not to protect those too childish to get it.

My grandmother died within 2 weeks of going to the grocery store. That doesn't mean going to the grocery store killed her any more than your grandmother's vaccine killed your grandmother.  There have been *millions* of people getting the vaccine, and the death rate among those who have is no higher than the usual expected death rate. The vaccine isn't killing people any more than going to Fred Meyer kills people.",mxbodo,2021-04-24 17:41:52
"Unless science has changed, I'm pretty sure herd immunity is people getting immunity from the people already vaccinated. That's why as long as the majority has it, we are good. Herd immunity doesn't need everyone for it to work just a large enough population. Are you sure you can think straight with the three or four masks you have on? Lol",mxbodo,2021-04-24 08:19:44

"You’re so insane for making that ridiculous comment. The vaccines are known to cause strokes and serious adverse events; unlike “going to the grocery store”. 🙄🙄🙄

Also, who gets to decide what is a “legitimate” medical exemption?? What if you had a past reaction to a vaccine, and a doctor doesn’t believe you or gaslights you and won’t grant you an exemption??",mxbodo,2021-04-24 17:44:38
"Herd immunity requires the vast majority to have immunity, not just a majority, and with how infectious covid is the requirement for how large the majority has to be goes even farther up.

Then again, I shouldn't be expecting accurate science from someone who thinks that Judas possesses people",mxbodo,2021-04-24 08:30:09
"The vaccines are not ""known to"" do any such thing. You are engaging in the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.

Medical exemptions exist for other vaccines. These will be handled the same way. Only a doctor can grant a medical exemption.",mxbodo,2021-04-24 19:01:24
"You looked into me? Hahaha somehow you have to use my earlier comments to beat me at this? Lol well you said it yourself not everyone has to get vaccinated for it to work. Which means that the draconian measures for covid passports will only harass people who refuse to get it. Which again makes sense in the era of control. Do you honestly never question the narrative? Is it really like that with you people? I'm legit curious. Big pharma makes a profit of having everyone sick but this time they want what's best for you. Nothing in your head says, that doesn't sound right? No?",mxbodo,2021-04-24 08:36:27
"“Known” by who? The corrupt people who simultaneously“researches” and profits from them, or the general public who suffers and dies from them???",mxbodo,2021-04-24 19:03:28
"I can see the science with my own eyes, there are numerous independent studies that confirm this and you can see and do the science for yourself.

Big Pharma makes a profit by selling medication that works and it's not like it's a single entity your can see how many different competitors there are even in just vaccines they gave to outdo the competition to make a profit

Please don't talk about draconian measures when following advice from a millennia old book that has no proof backing it up. I've questioned the narrative and recieved answers. have you ever questioned your narrative? Believing a version of history blindly with no evidence?",mxbodo,2021-04-24 09:44:41

4. There is not a caste system, as much as I wish you'd be reincarnated as a person with sound understanding of the situation at hand.

4. I understand private systems and their rights to set their own rules, but putting students in an ultimatum is not right. There is a student who is undergoing fertility treatments and she can't be on campus without taking the vaccine, which she is refusing to take until there is more data on impact on fertility treatments. This is discriminatory by nature.

"Hello! 

Hopefully I can answer some of these questions for you. 

#1: I believe you’re lost, and have posted to the wrong subreddit. We actually poke fun at people who are anti-vaccine here. 

I realize this may be a waste of my breath, but if you’re going to post these claims, please included sources for them. This way, people reading your comments can see where you are getting your misinformation from, and they can respond to your claims using your cited source, or better yet, they can have a laugh that you posted an article from the Babylon Bee unironically. 

Thanks for stopping by, but you might want to actually “do your research” about where you are posting your information BEFORE actually posting your information. But, in this case, you have already invalidated your entire arguments because you couldn’t even check which area of the internet you were spouting your claims to. This leads most of us here to come to the conclusion that if you can’t even check WHERE you’re posting something, you’ve most likely not checked WHAT you’re posting (since the latter typically involves more effort). 

I hope you find some of the answers you’re looking for, as I’m sure someone WILL rebuts your claims, but even if you find them, I’m not sure you’ll change your mind on anything. 

Cheers",mwz8ow,2021-04-23 18:03:25
"\#1 It isn't mysterious we know what is in it :D It does not void life insurance policies to my knowledge 

\#2 People did catch the flu but when you know there is a pandemic going on not the first thing to report on. Flu was way more mild this year due to the social distancing and mask mandates.

\#3 You wear the mask as you may still be a carrier for the virus even though you are not symptomatic and you body is fighting it off just fine. It is to protect the people who are unable to get vaccinated

\#4 No causal link has been made, no pauses are in place at this time for the vaccine. I did not experience any of those symptoms nor have any of the people I know to be vaccinated. 

\#5 Who is 'they' and what is 'the narrative' ? I'm not seeing any suppression of information.

\#6 We have a year+ of data and collection of data is still ongoing. No red flags and smooth sailing with studies coming out confirming the efficacy of vaccines.

\#7 Children aren't affected by covid? This is just false, you might be confused here. They have already began testing pediatric doses and results have show similar efficacy to adult doses and in some cases working even better.

\#8 Effects of vaccinated on non-vaccinated is that it puts the non-vaccinated people's mind more at rest as they are less concerned with catching the virus from you.",mwz8ow,2021-04-23 17:51:16

"Okay well let me destroy every point you have:

&#x200B;

1. [Pfizer was approved](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=On%20December%2011%2C%202020,COVID%2D19%20Vaccine), but other ones arent because these things take a long time, And this is the fastest we have identified the disease and made a vaccine ever.

2. Duh, people did. but compared to how many cases of covid we have had its not like people were walking around shouting about it. people did.

&#x200B;

3. The vaccine is good, but not perfect, it is not 100% guaranteed, this vaccine was made to prevent people from dying, not from 100% blocking it, it does a good job at blocking it, herd immunity. so wearing a mask makes it much more likely you can avoid it.

&#x200B;

4.I haven't seen anything about this. but if you have any evidence let me know.

&#x200B;

5.Because more people will die if it's opposed. 

&#x200B;

6. Please stop calling it a mystery substance, and there's actually a lot. google ""Vaccine evidence""

7. It can leave children with inflammation, and, some kids can develop [MIS-C](https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/#:~:text=What%20is%20MIS%2DC%3F,%2C%20eyes%2C%20or%20gastrointestinal%20organs)

&#x200B;

8. You don't seem to leave much evidence. But there is still a chance of you transmitting the virus after the vaccine.

&#x200B;

9. Not even gonna try to justify this. what?

&#x200B;

10.  your blood circulates through your body about 1400+ times a day, so no. that's not possible.

2: COVID-19 and the flu have similar symptoms, its hard to tell them apart

3: Vaccines keep you from dying, you can still get infected

4: IDK

5: IDK

6: It's a pandemic

7: The belief that children are 100% protected is a myth

8: We have no choice but to take the vaccine, if we don't more people could die.",mwz8ow,2021-04-29 14:48:04

"\#1 You don't know what they injected you with. You only know what they told you. 

\#2 Sure they haven't reported the flu because of the plandemic, but tell me, how many people that you personally know, got the flu? I've got many many friends and NO ONE got a flu this whole time.

\#3 Statistics are showing an increase of 38% in throat cancer after wearing these masks. The masks themselves cause more harm than the ""virus""

\#4 Your straight up lying right here. If you go to the [FDA.GOV](https://FDA.GOV) website, they have a notice in a bright yellow box that the J&J vaccine is in fact on pause because of side effects.

\#5 You're not seeing cencorship because you are so heavily embedded in it. Try going to unbiased and uncensored websites like bit chute .com  . You'll see just how censored the internet and MSM is.

\#6 How can you honestly say there are no red flags? Go to the covid vaccinated subreddit and take a look at what people are experiencing. 1 year back data is a steaming pile of doodoo, what does this substance do to you 5 years down the road. Give me information on that.

\#7 This mentality is destroying the lives of our youth. How are they ever going to recover from this? lack of socializing, constant tyranny in their face LITERALLY, they will survive without taking this poison, so will everyone else.

\#8 I'm not vaccinated and it sure as hell doesn't put me at ease. I don't want to be any where near a vaccinated person. For all I know they are carrying a next level virus. Which you know what that means...MORE VACCINES! Look at Michigan, they are the highest vaccinated state and coincidentally they currently have the HIGHEST SPIKE IN NEW COVID CASES.

I have two questions.

1. Where do you get *your* information from?
2. Why would the government want to make a vaccine that doesn't work, or causes even more harm? Our economy has been tanking for the past year, and millions are dying. That's one thing you Karens always forget when ranting about this- the motive.

Also, children aren't taking the vaccine- The manufacturers and the FDA say it's not safe for them yet. Shows what you know.

Edit: I was reading over your ""thesis"", and it seems like your definition of uncensored press is Fox News. Good for you.",mwz8ow,2021-04-23 19:14:45

"I don't need friends brother. Friends have a tendency of misleading you without either of you even realizing. As long as the places you have studied these things have a biased political stand point, they are as worthless as pixy dust. Pull your head out of the sand and take a look around you. This isn't about a fake virus that you've studied so deeply. There are things happening right now that could only happen by distracting the masses with this fake narrative of the virus.

Send me some of your sources, I'd like to see who these people are.",mwz8ow,2021-04-23 19:16:35
"The vaccines are there to push the vaccine passport agenda.

The vaccines will sterilize you. It's not a secret. Bill gates openly said the vaccines will depopulate the Earth by atleast 15%.

They are purposely crashing the economy, remember you'll own nothing and be happy? What does that mean, explain it to me?

The FDA has not approved ANY vaccine, all they said was emergency use authorization. They say this just to take all the liability off their back, so that when people start dying left right and center, they can say ""we never approved it, we only authorized it for emergency use"".

Unplug from the media and take a look at what's really happening. Unless of course you've already taken the poison, then you'll need as many other vaxed people for emotional support as possible. I can't imagine walking around with that poison in me, pretending everything is ok.",mwz8ow,2021-04-23 19:23:13

As for my sources, I search the deep web and there are a few sites still accessible on the regular internet. One of them being bit chute.com

Anytime you see a website removing videos or censoring comments, you have to understand they aren't a credible source. The real credible sources are the ones that lay out everything, good and bad and they don't try to tell you how to think. They let you do your own thinking and come up with an answer.

Remember the chem trails ""conspiracy theory""? Everyone made a mockery of that saying it was a lie and a bs conspiracy. Just this week CNBC released a video saying how they are in fact spraying the sky to dim the sun. Why on Earth are they doing that? And more importantly WHO GAVE THEM THE PERMISSION? I don't want my sunlight diluted, I never voted for that. No one voted for that. I'll send you the link if you're interested. 

They've violated our rights beyond comprehension, and it's only getting worst. I highly recommend looking at unrestricted unbiased sources. If you see a lot of bias where you are looking, there's definitely a problem. You need to step back and deeply analyze what they are planting in your mind.

3) It'll probably stop when the pandemic is under control and we don't have to keep fretting over what the proverbial plague rats do.

4) We're already divided. We have been for a long time now and people like you are the reason for that.

5) The vaccine will probably become a yearly thing. Like the Flu vaccine. Because slack jawed plague rats like you that wanted to scream, ""MUH FREEDUMS"" allowed COVID to mutate and multiply to the point that we're technically an Endemic status right now as opposed to the less drastic Pandemic status it's oft described as.

6) Yes. Yes I will.

7) ...where is it going?

8) Yes it is. The information and statistical data about this has been publicly avaliable to litterally everyone since the day the pandemic began!

9) If you aren't going to take the time to get at least a basic, laymen understanding of what mRNA is, then just shut your damn mouth about it.

10) Lets assume for the sake of argument you are in fact being genuine, and you actually believe all the tripe you're spewing. That doesn't make the fact this pandemic has caused the ENTIRE WORLD to grind to a halt to go away. That doesn't bring back the LITTERAL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE that this virus has killed, and the present undisclosed number (at least to my knowledge) that are STILL suffering because of the long term damage the virus has done to them. That doesn't excuse the fact that there are still people stuck jobless and struggling in their lives financally because they can't work and aren't being provided the money they need to just keep a goddamn roof of all things over their heads!

"Let me put the sources you're likely to get into perspective;

The sources pro-vaxxers will use will be from the CDC, NHS, and some universities or scientific journals with years of scientific research on their side and no reason to lie to you. They've literally dedicated decades to the advancement of medicine, and wouldn't knowingly compromise the safety of a patient.

The sources antivaxxers will use will be their Aunt Cindy's Facebook blog full of false or anecdotal evidence of people getting sick or having allergic reactions to the shots, and they benefit by lying and selling you 'alternative' or 'natural' remedies to diseases we figured out ages ago. They've done a few hours of research online and are entirely willing to risk their lives and the lives of those around them just because they read a conspiracy theory online.

Unless you're allergic to one or more of the components of a vaccine (which is entirely possible, and you should definitely check with your doctor first before going nuts getting immunized for everything) or immunocompromised (also see your doctor, they don't just inject you with all of these chemicals willy nilly and hope for the best), the odds of you having a severe negative reaction to a vaccination are extremely slim.",mvaqz2,2021-04-22 06:14:26
"There is a chance that you COULD get an allergic reaction to the vaccine. However, the chance is very low, and the pros of getting a vaccine heavily weigh out the possible cons. Let's say you get measles. There is a 1 in 4 chance that you will need to be hospitalised. It is almost guaranteed that you will get a bad rash, and a high fever. There is a low chance that you will die from it. However, it is guaranteed that you will have a very bad time for about 2 weeks. But, if you get the vaccine, there is a 0.0001% chance you will get an allergic reaction. The biggest side affect of vaccines are less people dying.",mvaqz2,2021-04-21 14:42:33

"As many people were saying, there is a very low chance that anything bad would happen to you if you have gotten a vaccine. Also, no vaccines do not have mercury in them and they do not cause autism. Several well renowned scientists and schools have done extensive research and studies on that topic and all of them have turned up false. Fun fact, vaccines USED to contain mercury but that was when they first came out (back in the 1800s and very early 1900s). The only thing about vaccines is that none of them so far are 100% guaranteed to “work”. What I mean by that is that you have a quite low chance that you do end up getting said disease, not from getting vaccinated just from it naturally entering your body, but the vaccine will greatly reduce the severity of the symptoms of that disease. If someone says vaccines are bad for you and they aren’t a doctor, they probably don’t know what they’re talking about and got something from some random person on social media.

OP, if you take a minute to compare all of the previous comments explaining why you should get vaccinated, or at the very least asking you for further information, they are all well written and give furthering information. This wonderful example of an anti-vax non-argument is all you need to know about the uneducated, frightened simpletons holding us back. They have no argument because they have no evidence with which to back up their beliefs. They just spew misinformation and fear and leave you standing in the mess they made, and then pat themselves on the back.

Op, please don't be like DarkDuck here. Do actual research. Here is an amazing site to find actually peer reviewed medical articles published by actual doctors and researchers. Some can be quite dense, but its about as close to the horses mouth as you can get without paying.

What are other view points on the topic and how does the evidence they provide compare to the other side's argument?

My largest gripes with these two books are that Janine Roberts is an investigative journalist and not a public heath or medical professional and just from reading the book's description there is a heavy bias towards anti-science sentiment. It is not a peer-reviewed work doing a controlled study on the topic but rather a commentary.

The second book's author has very little information public about him. The book was just published last year. All I can see is that they are from Russia and doesn't appear to be any form of medical professional.

"Ok im trying to explain this to you the best i can. Im pretty sure why it went so fats is because during a vaccine trial they have a group of people who get the vaccine and who dont and the trial end when a certain amount of people who didint get the vaccine get the virus and since covid is so wide spread those people who didint get the baccine got covid pretty quickly where compared to other diseases it can take years for the certain amount of people to contract the virus that are in the trial. Theirs alot more to this and dont take my word on it but this is like the baisics of the vaccine trials.

"Both of those books are impeccably well-referenced.  Indeed do consider each source carefully.  I've been on rather a binge of these topics, and no matter which books you read, the most important part is to read the various reference material yourself, as much as possible.  Generally I find that books critical of vaccination are better referenced than those in support.  


Sometimes it takes someone outside of a field to see that field clearly, as those in the medical industry have been through a lot of schooling and may be unable to see outside their bailiwick.  Roberts does an impressively thorough job in her investigations, with twelve years of research into that book, it's a quality of journalism one rarely sees these days.  The other book is largely just what it claims to be, a review of scientific literature, which is rather international in scope, yes including Russia.

It's still being tested on animals like yourself. Did you know that your life insurance becomes worthless because of this unapproved ""vaccine""? I bet they didn't mention that to you, did they?

You're fine now, but have you seen what this drug does to you in a couple years? Wait and see. If you don't develop fucked up problems in the next couple years, you have the right to tell me I know nothing.

Do you understand what your dumbass also did? You opened the gate for the tyrannical government to keep making more of this shit. There will be more and more ""strains and variants"" that will pop up, and guess what? You'll need more and more vaccines.

So once you decide to take it, you're stuck with it the rest of your life. It isn't a temporary decision. This is a next level drug that has NEVER BEEN TRIED ON HUMANS BEFORE!

"Do you know who Andrew Wakefield is?

He was the man who made the study that linked vaccines and autism

The man who started the antivaxx movement",mvaqz2,2021-04-23 21:41:34
"I'm not sure about ""flagship"" studies really, but there are actually starting to be a lot of studies that call the safety of various aspects of vaccines into question... there's [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Shaw2/publication/6682741_Aluminum_Adjuvant_Linked_to_Gulf_War_Illness_Induces_Motor_Neuron_Death_in_Mice/links/0deec521fbfd51c686000000.pdf) study, and others like it that investigate the safety of aluminum adjuvants.  For a detailed discussion of this and several studies demonstrating how aluminum from vaccines ends up accumulating in the brain and contributing to neurological disorders, see How To End The Autism Epidemic by JB Handley.

But in the end, the studies that do the most to convince me of the dangers of vaccines are the clinical trials themselves.  These studies, done by the companies producing said vaccines, are almost always of such incredibly poor quality that it's hard to see how it could be other than intentional.

Most vaccine trails **do not use a real placebo**, but rather other vaccines or vaccine ingredients!  When they do actually use a real inert (saline) placebo, they arrange the results in such a way as to obfuscate the actual results to make the vaccine look safer.

Take just one example here of the Gardasil vaccine, routinely given to millions.  If you look at the clinical trial that was used to license Gardasil (found right [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/74350/download) in the insert, 6.1) you'll see that this trial actually does use a saline placebo... although a smaller group of saline placebo than a placebo that is just the aluminum adjuvant!  While the first two tables include a separate column for each of the two ""control"" groups, the third strangely combines them.

Now, the data isn't present here, so the reason is obscured, but why not listen to the Godfather of vaccines himself, Dr. Stanley Plotkin, break it down in his [deposition](https://reformedhealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Plotkin_Deposition_Transcript_-_Matheson_Case_-_2018-01-11.pdf) under oath?  Earlier in this interview Plotkin had criticized a vaccine-critical study for being purely observational for having no placebo controls, and then is presented over and over with vaccine trial studies that have no placebo.  On around page 190 or so of that deposition, he's handed the actual data from that Gardasil study and guided through going through and having to admit that not a single one of the serious adverse events was in the saline control group, only in the adjuvant ""control"" group.  In fact, while Plotkin didn't admit it (""I am not a rheumatologist""), the results actually sound to me like without the various massaging that data got, that vaccine would have looked pretty fucking unsafe.

Seriously, the more I look at the foundations of vaccine ""science"", the more it's laughably junk.  As also discussed in that deposition (and in a [recent book](https://www.amazon.com/Illusion-Evidence-Based-Medicine-Exposing-credibility/dp/1743057245/)), the world of ""peer-reviewed science"" has become utterly corrupt by corporate profits.  If vaccines really were ""safe and effective"", then they wouldn't have to do such shit science, they could stand to be criticized, and not sling vitriol and names at anyone who questions their authority.

Seriously, [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhNGu3jFylU) that entire deposition of Plotkin, listen to him and tell me he's really doing good science and you should trust him and his ilk with our lives.",mvaqz2,2021-04-26 05:53:22

"1) No, I don’t have any links. I didn’t research it myself. My doctor is not an anti-vaccine proponent and chose to work with our family because of some valid concerns related to a vaccine reaction in one of our children. I trusted her to make that call because I knew her wish was to help us get vaccinated as safely as possible. 

2) I have no idea, but from what I see in homeschool groups I think they believe the “live virus sequencing” used for some of the vaccines means that the vaccines might have live virus with the potential to shed. From what I understand, the science is being misconstrued and misrepresented by some of the doctors these guys listen to.

3) in the homeschool groups I am in, they post YouTube “doctors” talking about all this stuff sometimes. Hence why I said the info is out there, keep digging. Google won’t give you those search results because it’s trying to deter misinformation and keep it from appearing in search, even when it is a scholarly pursuit to try to gain understanding not support the misinformation.

I think people are just comfortable now that they see everyone doing it. I think I’m going to wait a while to see the response to this vaccine. I already have seen that studies are showing herpes and shingles being linked to the vaccine, so that is very concerning. I don’t think it’s selfish for people to be wary on what is being put in their body. What makes me very upset is seeing people force over people to do something they are not comfortable with so they can feel “safe” in a bubble. Just FYI, the vaccine does NOT prevent covid just like getting a flu shot won’t prevent the flu. My 74 neighbor got the shot and a couple months later got Covid. And with all the new variants they are saying the vaccine can’t protect against those. If I knew there was a lot of research put into the vaccine and it was pretty effective against the virus then sure I’d take it, but there is still a lot of unknown out there.

"That’s real screwed up and like I said he still can get the virus even if you do get a vaccine. Just takes him to be around someone else who is most likely vaccinated too like my neighbor lol. I don’t understand people. Even if everyone got the vaccine it doesn’t prevent the virus and then on top of that there are mutant strains that bypass the vaccine all together. Yeah I’m hoping it will die out too, but I’m not holding my breath because I think this is more about power and control as sad as that is. I do think it’s a serious virus and people should be cautious, but it has a pretty high survival rate. I’m sorry you have to go through that at work. I would just explain that even if you are vaccinated you can still get it from someone else and carry it to work without even knowing until the symptoms set in.

"The issue with cancer is the immune system either can't keep up with the bad cell generation (which is why cancer risk is much higher in immunosuppressed people like transplant patients). Or the immune system just plain doesn't recognize the malignant cells at all and doesn't attack them as it should. There are so many variables it is a hugely difficult problem so mRNA is being researched to teach the body how to recognize it. Since Corona viruses are researched  and much simpler (lol simple in scientific terms) it was a matter of isolation of the protien that is unique to the virus and teaching the body via mRNA how to create it so the immune system learns how to attack it.

My big hope is adult stem cells potentially being used in generative organ replacement, especially for livers since livers already can regenerate. The idea here is to grow a large enough graft from the patient's own stem cells that can be transplanted with a much lower risk of rejection and need for immunosuppressive therapies since it's already the body's own cells. But this is probably a lifetime away right now.

Isn't science great? Someone I know told me last night that she doesn't trust scientists because they're being paid off like politicians.

"EVIDENCE SUMMARYThere are no specific guidelines for use of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines or contraindications to mRNA vaccines. No large trials of any mRNA vaccine have been completed yet.————The only evidence on safety of mRNA vaccines comes from small phase I and phase II trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with follow-up typically less than two months.Systemic adverse events such as fatigue, muscle aches, headache, and chills are common. Severe systemic adverse events were reported by 5 to 10 percent of trial subjects. Localized adverse events such as pain at the injection side are common.Both systemic and local adverse events usually are resolved within one or two days.The rate and severity of adverse events appears to be higher for the second dose of vaccine than for the first. Higher vaccine doses appear to increase the rate and severity of adverse events.Larger trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in progress, with results expected in mid-2021.There is not sufficient evidence to support any conclusions on the comparative safety of different mRNA vaccines. Direct evidence on the comparative safety of mRNA vaccines and other vaccines is lacking.© Copyright 2020 by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. Al",mtgfzx,2021-05-16 18:29:13

To address the neurological safety of a product long term clinical trials and placebo based safety studies are relevant. Those have never been done with this product.

GSK recently withheld data of suicide risk in kids while marketing Paxil to them.

This is a 2016 study exploring the neurotoxicicity of this vaccine.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/

The professional researchers carrying out this study found that HBV had a neurotoxic effect.

""This work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders suchas autism and multiple sclerosis (Gallagher and Goodman, 2010; Stubgen, 2012). This study used the same vaccine and a similar time schedule to those used for human infant vaccination in China. Therefore, these findings suggest that there may be similar effects of neonatal HBV vaccination on brain development and behavior in humans.""

This is a 2018 study on the subject:

“These findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.” IL-4 mediates the delayed neurobehavioral impairments induced by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination that involves the down-regulation of the IL-4 receptor in the hippocampus.""

This 2018 study found brain damage from the aluminum adjuvant used in HBV.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29221615/


""This is the first experimental study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that aluminum adjuvants can impair social behaviour if applied in the early period of postnatal development.""

This 2017 study likewise found that low dose aluminum adjuvant impaired behavior:

""Neurobehavioural changes, including decreased activity levels and altered anxiety-like behaviour, were observed compared to controls in animals exposed to 200μg Al/kg but not at 400 and 800μg Al/kg. Consistently, microglial number appeared increased in the ventral forebrain of the 200μg Al/kg group.""

I understand the Milgram experiments and the Stanford Prison Project prove the authoritarian power turns people into many tyrants and willfully willfully willfully carrying out evil acts against humanity and communism and fascism in the state controlled media proves such people will even turn on their own friends and family, but to see it happen real time in the streets is shocking.

The lockdowns the lies of censorship and the fact that it's global is clear that the elite have declared war on humanity. And this corruption on this scale to affect the globe shows just how deep the globalists are in the power are in the power that they think that they have. But they only wield this delusion of power because useful idiots do their bidding and carry out their orders, as it was in the in any time that humanity faced tyranny. And the only times that we free ourselves from tyranny is when people unite against the common enemy, which most of you are well aware of. It's been obvious for years that the media and politicians have turned to divisive language to create hate baiting the people to fight each other, distracted from the real enemy. Now the public is being attacked by this enemy and their narratives are further seek to divide us as vaccinated versus unvaccinated. And seeing and feeling a lot of that myself in private life based on all the evidence, it's clear that the vaccines are not providing immunity to this virus, then that's just by admission to the people who are walking them cocking them, I should say that they have the worst side effect of rating any, any sort of worse side effects rating of any vaccine in history, far exceeding even the 1976 h1N1 botched vaccine program by 1000 times, and yet they are doing everything they can to force this on the public despite growing protests of doctors, nurses, frontline workers, seeing the vaccine injuries. Humanity is facing an existential crisis, where this crime against humanity is affecting you, your children, your parents, your friends, your community, the future generations of humans we are facing extermination and soft kill weaponry in the form of a genetic experiment, under the lie of a vaccine insidious in every possible unconscionable way initially by the time people realize what's happening, it may be too late.

This is not even fucking disputed.  That book I referenced contains MANY references to scientific conferences and CDC publications backing it up.  She personally attended some of these, and gives good first-hand accounts (there are also official transcripts).  And if you think these are old ancient methods and things are more modern now, it's bullshit, very little has changed in vaccine production since the '50s.

"The way your phrasing it lets me understand that you don't fully understand WHY the vaccination process is the way you've described. The process you've described is the biological process involved in isolating antigens for vaccines. Anyone can make any process sound unappealing in the way you've described.

 ""Who wants to eat ground-up burnt mushy acidic fruits trapped in aluminum for 4 months and put them on a yeast-infected hydrated mass of crushed grass with citric acid and rennet-treated, almost- rotten milk?""

 Well I've just described pizza and I'm pretty sure you'd agree that anyone can phrase anything in an unattractive way. 

Viruses work by infiltrating the cell and altering the cell's dna. It basically hijacks the cell and forces it to become a virus factory. Killing these viruses is how your body works  to defend itself. 

Luckily your body has a type of white blood cell called antibodies. Antibodies can be used to target such viruses by being exposed to the viruses surface proteins and learning how to destroy it. However this has the unfortunate side effect of having to be sick in order to be exposed to the virus. 

The ""grinding up tissues and filtering fluids"" as you've so eloquently described is essentially making it so that exposure to viruses are unnecessary. I am not disputing that the process you've described is more or less, correct.

 Vaccines are essentially deactivated viruses or the rna required for the protein synthesis of the formation of antibodies. Deactivated viruses are basically dead viruses that the white blood cells in your body can read and make proper antibodies for without making your body sick because their dna doesn't infect your cells. RNA viruses contain only the RNA for these viruses, allowing your body to go directly into making the proteins necessary for defense 

You seem to be uncomfortable with the idea of having ""ground up tissues of sick people"" inside of you when in reality, the process is much more nuanced, sterile, and government approved. Vaccines have saved countless lives and will continue to do so. 

This is all high school biology and I'm shocked you're not aware of any of it. I would highly recommend you educate yourself using reliable sources. Friends are not reliable sources. People who agree with your stance are not always reliable. Trust the scientists and the doctors.

"If you wanted to ride space mountain (a ride with a 2 hour line) 8 times - normally it’d take 16 hours minimum. And you might take some breaks.

That’s what has happened - normally there’s a lot of paperwork and you have to wait in line for all of it to be reviewed. For this though, every country prioritized getting the COVID vaccine paperwork properly reviewed immediately. So the time waiting in line was eliminated.

What law? masks and vaccines are not a law it’s only a recommendation.... they can’t mandate you to be a lab rat people are signing up for that. They also studied covid vaccines for almost 30 years and the ferrets died or either got sick. That’s why it’s not fda approved! It’s only being administered right now under emergency use only... wonder why we are still in lockdown??? btw Johnson and Johnson just had their vaccine pulled for causing blood clots. Pfizer and Monderna just released you need a booster every six months so vaccines do not save lives or prevent you from getting the virus so what’s the point? They manipulate stupid people into believing that. Sorry but my life and family’s hasn’t changed since the beginning of all this. I know many people who don’t vaccinate or wear masks and we are all healthy.

"no trust to FDA WHO as they kill millions of people each year with their drugs just to earn money. They know what they are doing, and make up ""treatment"" recommendations just to earn money from antidepressants finasteride benzo accutane antihistamines chemotherapy and another bullshit + to make people stupider = no trust in vaccine. It is that simple.

I saw many kids getting autism from previous vaccines (I am not talking about covid mRNA vaccine because it is completely different) because they contain heavy metals like aluminium, which leads to a decrease in the production of gluthation and increased oxidative stress. I personally knew one kid totally healthy who got this shit after vaccine. like he was completely normal before it, and then could not talk... Took months to detox him from it and recover methylation. A lot of my familiar doctors also reported cases of autism after vaccine. On forums we had several people with POIS CFS etc after vaccine against malaria. 

You have no idea what is behind of the FDA and WHO and what terrible people are there. I have no idea. I only talk about obvious things I see. 

I mean I think that in case of vaccine, it is a necessarry measure against COVID pandemic, but I have not seen any proof of its safety despite anecdotal ""two months follow-up"". Thay have not monitored what is going on with cells, and first adverse reaction of oxidative stress is depression and as you understand neither patient and WHO FDA will not take it seriously. We do not know to what changes their vaccine lead long-term. I xmust admit that probably the danger of covid is much higher, but what I mean is that it is up to me choose whether to vaccinate. Taking into consideration my health profile history age, I see that there is much less danger from covid than vaccine. 

I am not against vaccine, but all people should choose by themselves

I have a background in science and I decided to fine clear statistical proof to prove to people that vaccines are bad, but as I looked into the issue I found that vaccines are not as dangerous as I though, and some of the disease s the prevent are more dangerous than I knew

However, it is true that a lot of the serious diseases we vaccinate for were rare even before vaccination, and most of the ones that were common were things people usually recover from

However, vaccination still helps to make these rarer, and even the mild infections can have severe complications, so vaccination still helps

"Lmao linking a Wikipedia source, you’re extremely naive. The general population and even based intellectuals and practitioners in the medical community don’t even know what’s used in vaccines so what makes you so sure ? What makes you so sure that vaccines are safe? The only real fact relative to vaccines safety is that government make you feel safe and what your tv tells you what the science professionals say is safe and that makes you feel better, it’s nothing more than a placebo. Vaccines in fact destroy your own living thriving resilient immune system because it’s being replaced with another immune operating system. Thousands of children have been paralysed in Africa and India because of untested trials of a number of vaccines and they were used as guinea pigs. You think the dairy industry is bad, only if you knew about the vaccine industry you would just utterly sick and the truth just gets swept under the rug and it’s covered up. The scientists at the top level that have spoken out go missing or end up dead shortly after and the death of cause in most cases are always suspect. 

Scientists and medical practitioners have such inflated egos and won’t admit they are wrong or they’re “medicine” is proven wrong or debunked, sadly the ones that get to the stop are fragmented and have no real intimacy with their own selves and are lost with no direction in how the world operates. The real scientists usually don’t make it because the slave masters can’t let that out to the general public for obvious reasons. 

My goodness people this is absolute madness, madness.",mq8gpt,2021-04-14 05:19:16

"Which one did you get? Astra zeninca ? Pfizer? And how old are you? 

The vaccine isn’t supposed to “kill” people it’s merely just a testing ground where they can use humans as “research” and gauge the populist areas on planet earth with their experiments, it’s the perfect guise under the name of “health and safety” to enforce a technocratic fascist ruling and squash anyone that does not conform and then singled out and have their lives ruined. You know what else it ruins, it’s kind ironic that the biggest deceptive trick that the globalists want you to forget is that you have a perfectly functioning immune system because taking the jab year after year in many proven studies is that it actually weakens your own immune system and is being re wired and only protects yourself against a covid strain and nothing else so next time when you get sick it will be a lot weaker, which in turn makes you more reliant on having to get another shot year after year until you won’t be able to survive the next “flu” whether it be covid 2022 covid 2023 etc etc that’s the big secret.

More people are dying from hypoxia and lung stress induced illnesses from wearing masks because it spikes cortisol and that lowers you’re immune system and you’re breathe breaks down the polymers and plastic waste in their masks and causes all types of problems, more people died from bacterial pneumonia than the virus during the bubonic plague but that’s none of our business is it 😉 

It also divides people into another divisional sector, anti vaxxers and pro vaxxers. 

Once everything is up and live and on the grid in a few years if there isn’t a strong pushback it will be completely mandatory for everyone or you won’t be able to get your own groceries and have a social credit score attachéd with all your data and vaccines. 

You ever see that Rick and morty episode where jerry is at the table and has a bowl of tablets in his breakfast bowl and the state robot guard that resides their makes sure his task is to encourage their recommend medicine supplementation or suffer punishment ? It’s a bit over the top but that’s a very possible reality. All these movies and tv shows have literally predicted it because theyre tech is over hundreds of years advanced and have made deals with higher advanced races in exchange for our children and organ harvesting and deep underground testing facilities, but but it’s just a movie ! Lol 

If you can’t work out how deceptive and sketchy this entire covid farce is and how it’s another chess move on the board for the globalists I don’t blame you tbh dopamine addictions and propaganda is flashy and trendy at the time but the truth eventually comes out in the end, putting your life at risk just to defend yourself against a virus that has a 99+% recovery rate is beyond ludicrous.",mq8gpt,2021-04-15 07:02:37

Oh and the countless others around the globe I’m talking millions that have picked up serious side effects and some that they don’t even know of. If you’re died with nothing to do with covid it’s been put down as covid in ALOT of cases, if you die of the vaccine you die because of a “heart attack” or he was one of the rare unlucky cases. 

These people that haven’t even come forward because of the fear of backlash and judgment or fear of being CANCELLED. You’re shunned if you don’t believe in pseudo mainstream science, it’s gross and so out of touch with our reality oh my goodness people, good health can’t be injected with a syringe it’s totally primitive thinking. A lot of so called educated people believe the be all end all starts with a shot of neurotoxic unknown metals and elements and god really knows what’s in the covid one 😏 good health starts within, it start with your environment , what you watch , what nutrition you’re feeding yourself. We have an immune system for a reason and taking vaccines every year actually in turn weakens it as when the time comes when we need to defend it our immunity has no resistance and is literally shot. 

So if you’re taking vaccines for a long time you’re actually becoming reliant on them, years later we will only find this out but a lot of people will have literally no immune system defence and people won’t be able to survive without the yearly flu jab lmao. 

Oh and the hundreds of thousands of Indian and African people that actually DIED during the testing trials of vaccines. 

Every single vaccine comes with side effects whether you want to believe it or not, whether you’re fine after and don’t notice it they are there and it’s only because the lack of awareness of our own bodies as so many humans are severely disconnected and think it’s normal... bruh you all need to seek help for some unfortunately a lobotomy wouldn’t even work to wipe out that heavily brainwashed mind.

At the end of the day, I’ve been apart of the institutionalised literature and government for over 35 years and was in numerous underground black budget testing facilities I got to dabble with certain vaccines. So I’ll tickle your feathers and let you know of a little secret, Vaccines serve one purpose, they serve as an operating system for what purpose, well you stay to connect the dots and get out of your brainwashed thinking and blindly believe your masters and government bodies and actually start living in the real world you might just find out.

Vaccines do not weaken your immune system. Vaccines work by causing your immune system to recognise a virus and react to it. If you have no immune system then the vaccine will do absolutely nothing.

Neurotoxic unknown metals?? If these metals are unknown, how are you able to determine they are neurotoxic?

You contradict yourself all the way through that rant and it's only your complete lack of understanding that prevents you from seeing this.

Medicine is not static and neither are the groups identified to be silenced.  

Breathe and consider that a slippery slope for one is a slippery slope for everyone. 

If your voice, be it pro or anti something (anything) you felt integral to the survival and optimal functioning of your community were silenced would that be ethically acceptable to you?

We must protect the voices of all.  Are there costs? Yes. Are there coats to silencing voices? Yes. I believe the costs of the latter outweigh the costs of the former.

No. People are being told it's anti-science to jump to insane conclusions such as 'the vaccine will alter your DNA' and 'it'll make you infertile' or 'it's meant to de-populate the planet.' Or, the classic 'it's experimental, it was untested.' And it very much is anti-science to make any of those claims. All the data about what's in the vaccine, what it does, and how it works is out there. Waiting to be read. But, people ignore it because the people saying it are with 'them', whoever 'them' is.

And frankly, if you're running around making those claims and ignoring the national forest's worth of evidence that debunks it, then you very much are a brain damaged dolt who probably isn't smart enough to make informed decisions.",mpftcl,2021-04-13 22:19:25

What the vaccine is and is not is not a belief. The vaccine is what it is. **Period.** So, to say it's all these things that it's not, is just flat out lies and should not be considered.

For many, it’s increased protection for others, they catalyze anaphylaxis, comas, adverse neurological issues, immuno-suppressive diseases, or worse.  You might say there are only small numbers injured and killed.  The numbers may be significantly smaller than those who do not suffer injuries, but they are not insignificant.  Especially when they occur in you, your family or are anomalously high in your community. 

Stop with the safe and effective mantra.  The truth is their safety has not been fully established or they would be approved and not authorized currently.  Johnson and Johnson has had pause to verify if their product is safe enough to move forward.  

At least give these new types of vaccines a Thalidomide-length waiting period before declaring their safety and demanding the silence of others.  
 
Also, there are those who believe their concerns regarding the experimental nature of these vaccines are very valid (see link below). Do you believe they should be silenced?

Actually, safety has been fully established. It's established in the statistics. Like the J&J issue? That happened in SIX women. Out of 6.8 million vaccines. And that's across the board-the adverse reaction rates is barely scraping even one tenth of one percent. 

Freaking PEANUTS have a higher rate of adverse reactions, yet no one's claiming that peanuts are unsafe to eat. 

And, frankly, if you're claiming the vaccine is experimental, than you're either an idiot who doesn't know what you're talking about or a liar who is intentionally trying to misinform people. The vaccines HAD an experimental period. Last Year. Each one was tested in a double blind study with a placebo on groups of 40,000+. Just like any other vaccine.

"Just fyi, the appeal to authority fallacy (or argument from authority) is when someone makes a claim which they support exclusively through the argument that some authority ""said so"". It is not necessarily fallacious to site an expert or authority figure as a source for information, it only becomes a problem when you forgo providing actual evidence and instead rest your entire position on that position also being supported by some supposed authority.

And while we're on the subject, just so you know, deciding whether something is valid or not based exclusively on the person or organization that produced it, rather than on the merits of the thing itself, is what is known as the genetic fallacy, and it is not a logically sound argument. 

So for example, if someone said, ""No we can't trust those numbers, look that website is a .gov so obviously the information there can't be trusted."" That would be an example of genetic fallacy. But if they said, ""I'm skeptical of that source so I looked into how they collected their data and there is obvious bias in these specific ways in their methodology"" that would be a valid argument for not trusting a set of data.

Appeal to authority, not a good argument.

""Chief say rock bad. Rock hurt family. Rock make Grug trip and fall. Rock bad.""

Not an appeal to authority. *Better* argument though not necessarily true.

""Chief say rock good, everybody need rock for house. Chief is liar, so rock must be bad.""

Genetic fallacy and, just like the appeal to authority, not a good or accurate argument.

""Chief say rock good, everybody need rock for house. Grug say rock too heavy. Grug make house from wood. No need rock.""

A better argument that cites actual evidence and doesn't just rely on a fallacy.

"Well in theory that holds up yes, although what you fail to understand is that vaccines aren’t what they used to be and now with the giant leap of technology that has taken place as of late and the discovery of nano technology, humans are now seen as replaceable in the echelons of our hierarchy after decades of study and testings in this field. These vaccines in the past 5-10 years and especially this years covid vax rollout is the new grand testing opportunity that has been their big wet dream all along. It was planned, covid wasn’t just some big random event, they were talking about this for YEARS so when the time comes it wasn’t just some big shock to the masses. The vaccine literally alters chromosome 8 directly effecting fertility directly and I assume you don’t know this but I think it’s time you start doing your due diligence sir. 

You only need to look at the blue print and end goal, have you not listened to anything your masters have told you? Might be worth checking out some previous Bill Gates Ted talks and numerous others tech and science speakers at Ted talks. 

This nano gel or vaccines that you believe are the holy grail for fighting mysterious diseases and is our saving grace is nothing more than the next transition into becoming fully functioning cyborgs and the merging of human and AI completely, the ones with no connection to source and loathe any type of benevolent love and divine spark with merge first. I’m not religious nor do I believe a single serving all powerful god per se, I’m just saying there’s a forces at play which aren’t who they say they are and using them to gain control over the masses for one of the biggest con jobs of our generation that threatens humanity at its core.

"I wonder what the fun in this is. Is it just satisfying to watch how easy it is to get people to lose control of themselves? 

When I was younger I used to play Little Big Planet and it had a mode where you could play maps created by other players. There was this one map that got copied a whole bunch that I remember really enjoying. In it, you're running across a series of platforms that are floating on the top of a body of water. 

Basically, the goal is to run across all the platforms and get to the other side without dying. Easy, right? Well whoever created the map also added these ""sharks"" in the water that were created out of a collage of different physics objects from the game. They had some simple command to chase after the player if you got within range, and they had these crazy fast motors attached to them so they would just absolutely fly out of the water at you and then rain back down from the sky. 

As you can imagine, after only a few seconds running along the platforms, the whole map would very quickly start to devolve into utter chaos. I think the reason me and my friends loved maps like this so much is just because it was endlessly amusing to watch this unpredictable physics engine just completely spaz out and these monster sharks who were way too powerful for their own good shred themselves to pieces with their own speed.

"I am vaccine injured, as is my wife. I went into anaphylactic shock within a few hours after my last vaccine booster at age 11. The doctors denied it had anything to do with the vaccine, refused to report it as an injury and I’ve suffered chronic issues since.  My wife’s injury resulted in a debilitating immune-deficiency disorder. 

Censorship by corporations and the manipulation of statistics by government offices and health agencies has expanded dramatically and is abhorrent. (Example: Covid mortality statistics listed by the CDC now include pneumonia, influenza, and Covid, and those suspected to have had Covid. They stopped tracking flu deaths in the US last April, if I remember correctly. Covid mortality statistics are now presented as “PIC” mortality. 

Somewhere around 2020, the scientific method changed.  To ask questions is now considered anti-science.  

mRNA therapies opposed by medical and genetic ethicists for decades were presented as vaccines and were granted emergency authorization.  Although the vaccines are yet to be approved, the mantra is that they are safe and effective. 

I’m not getting the vaccine, but its not because of my understandings of biochemistry, immunology, and the history of the companies and agencies involved. 

I’m disallowed because of my medical history.

6 people out of 6.8 million given the J&J shot had the rare blood clots. That’s .00009% (rounded up to be generous to you.)

Being on artificial birth control raises your clot risk to between .3%-1% but I’m guessing you’re  fine with that.

"I don't think that most people will acknowledge that he at the underpinning for it but I think that his ""scientific"" argument is where all of the so-called hesitation and denialism in the modern entire flows from.

Basically the argument seems to go two different directions:

Either:
""This study shows that vaccines cause autism""
""It was fake""
""That's a lie, it's a cover up""

Or

""This study shows that vaccines cause autism""
""It was fake""
""Oh ok. Well this one does""
""No it doesn't""
""Well this one does""
""No it doesn't""
""Well the jury is still out on this other concern""
""...."" Etc

As for the claims of concerns over DTP, I'll be honest I'm not familiar with that, but I don't think that that is really relevant. Yes there were concerns with other vaccines from a whole bunch of different groups over the years all the way back to when vaccines were first invented, religious objections and health objections. But they always were from marginal groups. The movement on  skyrocketed after Wakefield.",moa79s,2021-04-11 00:30:06
"There have always been people who were against a vaccine for some reason or another, but DTP really started the modern antivax movement, and then wakefield made it bigger

Now it includes a lot of claims that were nothing to do with wakefield, so it's really not accurate to say it's all based on him",moa79s,2021-04-11 02:03:46
What I mean though is that there are people who make claims against vaccines who otherwise would have no interest in vaccines had it not been for the movement which Wakefield started,moa79s,2021-04-11 02:15:45
"He did make it bigger, that is true, I just see a lot of people that think disproving him disproves the whole antivax movement and that is not true",moa79s,2021-04-11 02:22:02
Any claims that stem from his arguments is subject to the same flaws of his original premise,moa79s,2021-04-11 02:24:22
"My point is that many antivax claims to not stem from his arguments

He made the claim that when combined with mumps and rubella, the vaccine strain measles virus caused a chronic intestinal infection that lead to autism, and therefore the 3 in 1 MMR should not be used

The antivax claims about mercury, aluminum, pertussis, HPV, and any vaccine other than MMR do not originate from his study and therefore cannot be debunked by debunking his study",moa79s,2021-04-11 02:29:40
The claims that they correlate with autism do. He was the original person to publish on the subject of autism being linked to vaccine. His research was completely disproven but the cat was out of the bag people needed an excuse to continue to support his findings even though they had been disproven and so they moved on changing the goal post.,moa79s,2021-04-11 02:31:37

It’s easy to look at them and call them morons, but ultimately I think they are to be pitied. I know what it’s like living in a household filled with fear that was ultimately completely manufactured. Mocking and condescending them only makes them dig in their heels harder, because they’ve bought into a belief system that’s trained them to anticipate harsh criticism.

"What you’re saying is true, sad, but true, and it’s the reason why I truly believe that part of solving this problem is going to be compassionate, empathetic, open dialogue between scientists, medical professionals, and vaccine hesitant people. Right now, vaccine hesitant parents are often afraid to ask questions out of fear of being ridiculed, and the anti-vaccine community is winning because they’re the ones reaching out to vaccine hesitant people with their misinformation, they’re the ones listening, they have more of an online presence, and they’re the ones who appear to be accepting and compassionate. So, you end up with people who could still easily be well informed being contacted and swayed by anti-vaccine groups rather than by pro-vaccine groups, doctors, or scientists. You end up with a dangerously misinformed and rapidly growing population of people. 

Studies have shown that, online, anti-vaxx groups have a greater influence than pro-vaccine ones, and are doing quite a bit of damage. It might not work in all cases due to cognitive bias, but I truly believe compassionate engagement and dialogue, listening, and spreading empirical truth louder and farther and wider is part of the answer. Has anyone qualified ever bothered to sit down with this mother, hear her out, and dispel vaccine misinformation and her irrational fears in a compassionate way? In a way that she could understand?

Is there any way to get them back into reality? These ""alternative"" medicine groups can be huge echo chambers and they are mostly fueled by fear.


There are some that surround themselves with other antivaxxers and it seems impossible to convince them otherwise because they support each other in their misinformed beliefs.

How can we talk to people who have gotten in there like that?",mnj6zy,2021-04-10 04:03:56
"To be honest, I think everyone is tried of trying to fix stubborn stupidity. Pretty much impossible to fix (except for the few willing to be logical and at least temporarily put their beliefs aside to consider another point of view). The trouble is that as you remove the ""weaker"" elements if such a group,  the average cling to such beliefs increases and so people are more willing to believe someone so confident. The only bit of rational I can see for it is to stop the spread by showing the rest of the world how illogical they are. This doesn't help thos who are being affected by it, but it is kind of like a vaccine to prevent anyone else from getting the stupid bug. Stupidity can spread quickly if it is not watched.

How would you do better? If you have a method that works for those not willing to be reasonable, we can all learn from you. If not, stop complaining.",mnj6zy,2021-04-10 10:27:40
"True to some extent, but Facebook groups can't just buy out almost every scientist and historian (living and dead) that has documented the effectiveness of vaccines. Twisting data and its explanation is easy, particularly by accident, but a complete reversal of the truth is not. Science is meant to be perfect logic, but it is performed and reviewed by people who are not perfectly logical (no one is). That is why other people check everything that is put out by others. Understanding basic science is easy, you just have to understand logic and accept the work of others, once check by thousands of other people, as correct. Those who speak of ""science worship"" usually don't understand this sort of thing and idolize the other members of their Facebook groups and support groups as they hoard potatoes in preparation for being forced to take a serious deadly serum made from poison and dead babies.

"Yep, I totally agree with you. People who are on the fence tend to be swayed by the group who are kind to them, regardless of what agenda they’re pushing. Having grown up in the antivax community, I can verify that they are by a large margin very kind, welcoming people who will sit down with you, talk to you for hours, and make you feel heard. When faced with the vitriol that most pro vax people throw around, it’s no wonder more and more hesitant people are turning antivax. I will be forever grateful for my doctor who took time to talk me through my fear of vaccines and the incredibly sweet nurses who held my hand when I got my first shots since I was a baby. I wish more people had the ability to see past the controversy and see people as human beings with fears that need to be compassionately handled",mnj6zy,2021-04-11 01:26:01
"I wish I knew. I know more about what doesn’t work than what does. Confrontation does nothing, it only makes them defensive. I think attempting to actually listen to them and acknowledging their fears can help them see that you’re on their side. They view themselves as a victimized minority, so making an attempt to actually understand them will probably go a long way. I’ve noticed people who fall for antivax tend to be people who have a miss understanding of how science works. You can try to educate them but it’s really hard because you need to do it in a way that doesn’t insult their intelligence. It’s also made harder because a lot of them have an intense distrust for the medical system in general and will dismiss studies out of hand because they view researchers as corrupt. 

It might seem dramatic but having grown up with and around antivaxxers I think a lot of them need to be treated in a similar way to cult members. They have to be continually exposed to new ideas, treated extremely gently, and worked with for a prolonged period of time. It takes a lot of time, empathy, and patience and most people aren’t willing for that. It’s easier to just dismiss them. My brother and I been talking with my mom for two years now and there’s been very minimal progress. It’s almost an issue of morals for some of them. It’s next to impossible to convince a person their morals are wrong once they have a firm grasp on them.

Prevention is better than cure I think. If you have a friend or family member showing interest in extreme alternative health, it’s better to talk to them sooner rather than later. I don’t think all alternative health is bad. Some people have great experiences with it, but if someone is putting their life or the life of a loved one in danger because of it, it’s gone too far. I’ve actually had a family member die of untreated cancer because they wanted to treat it naturally. It’s really really sad, but sometimes you have to accept that some people are too far gone and all you can do is make sure the vulnerable people around them are safe like the dad did in the post. 

I’m sorry I don’t have a more hopeful answer for you. TLDR: treat them like human beings with valid although miss informed concerns, be very patient and empathetic, and if all else fails, accept that they may never change and make sure that they can’t hurt the vulnerable people around them",mnj6zy,2021-04-10 10:46:28

"First of all, I love your attitude and your approach. I really appreciate you opening up dialogue, being respectful of others views, and realizing that we *are* all on the same team. So often, humans fail to realize that our collective welfare depends on individuals, and  vice versa. Society, as it exists, depends on cooperation, we are interdependent. And vaccine hesitant people deserve to have their concerns appropriately and compassionately addressed. 

To me, someone who isn’t comfortable with the COVID-19 vaccine just yet doesn’t constitute an anti-vaxxer. And, on the topic of me, I should probably explain a few things. I am a staunchly pro-vaccine person, I’m a mother, I’m educated in the field of biology and currently back in school and about to graduate with my second degree, and my largest hobby / fascination aside from the fields I chose to pursue is studying philosophy with a strong focus on logic and normative ethics. I’ve researched the anti-vaccine movement extensively (I wrote my senior thesis and about a half dozen other papers about it). Suffice it to say, this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart.  

Here’s what I mean when I say that I don’t think that someone who is skeptical about the Covid vaccines is an anti-vaxxer: these vaccines are new. New things can be scary, a lack of a well-established foundation of empirical evidence can be scary. Not sure if you’re from America, but our industries, and our societies and larger moral codes, they place money above humans. That’s scary. Big Pharma...well, it’s scary. Truly. There’s lots of shady shit going on, and I certainly don’t agree with the system of medical extortion that we have going on. “You need insulin or you’ll die? Who gives a shit! Better cough up your entire paycheck, or we will dance on your grave.” It’s gross. I don’t fault anyone for hating a system like that, or being skeptical of the resulting products. But the benefits of vaccination, evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccination, the research, the practice of vaccination itself....these things reach far beyond our borders. And even within our borders, most people who study, create, support, and administer vaccines are just normal people, educated people, people doing their jobs without an agenda. 

And, as I mentioned before, I don’t fault people for being skeptical until more data is collected. Particularly with all of the anti-vaccine rhetoric that nearly everyone has been exposed to, I don’t fault people for asking “well...is it really safe? How do I know it’s safe? How can we say it’s safe without having more data? How do we know that there aren’t long-term side effects?” These are reasonable concerns, reasonable questions to ask, and questions that perhaps haven’t been properly addressed by the scientific community in a way that people can understand.

And then there’s all of the stories coming out about 9 people at a mass vaxx clinic having some negative side effects, and people having side effects after the second dose of two-dose vaccines...I get it. I have reviewed much of the data resulting not only from these vaccine trials but that has been collected thereafter, including what has been submitted to VAERS, and, I suppose I benefit from being able to understand it due to my background in biology, but it is my firm opinion that these vaccines (mRNA or viral vector) are safe. The mRNA vaccines contain no adjuvants. Almost all anti-vaxx arguments don’t and can’t apply. The argument can’t be made that their ingredients are harmful, unless you’re allergic to PEG. I believe that these vaccines are safe, effective, and that their benefit far outweighs their risk. But I can understand why some people might not. I don’t see any evidence to suggest they aren’t, none of their ingredients are harmful, there is absolutely nothing about them that makes me think they aren’t safe in the short and long term. But, I get the hesitancy. Not everyone’s a scientist. And in today’s social and political climate...I can’t fault distrust. 

But, not wanting to get the Covid vaccine right now is different from being entirely anti-vaccine, choosing to ignore all evidence that vaccines are an incredibly safe medical intervention, choosing to succumb to misinformation rather than empirical, well-evidenced fact that has stood the test of time. 

Here’s what I believe. I believe that anti-vaxxers (and as I have outlined, people who are hesitant about the Covid vaccines aren’t anti-vaxxers) are a dangerous byproduct of misinformation bred with cognitive bias bred with logical fallacy bred with the greater science and medical community not doing their part to recognize the problem and address it compassionately and loudly. I think that those of us who are pro-vaccine need to be *listening* to the concerns of vaccine hesitant people. I think that it does us a disservice to say “vaccines are perfect, they never hurt anyone, no questions should be asked about them, there’s no way they could be improved, and everyone who doesn’t agree is an idiot.” That’s not how medical treatments of any kind work. There’s always risks, and there’s always benefits. There’s always room for improvement. Saying anything else would discredit the merits of the scientific method. 

What I will say is that humans are inherently bad at assessing risk. They are inherently bad at not taking mental shortcuts. They are inherently bad at drawing appropriate conclusions from available evidence. Biases are inherent, they’re our brains way of making sense of a never ending steam of external and internal stimuli. That’s why you need to go to school for so long to be a scientist, or a doctor, so that you can truly come to understand, from the ground up, how things truly are theorized to work based on what’s justified and observable. And in my opinion, those who are anti-vaccine are not appropriately assessing risk, and they certainly don’t possess the scientific or medical knowledge to assess risk or anything else really relating to vaccines. 

We (largely due to vaccines) are lucky enough to live in an age where our loved ones aren’t dying left and right from communicable disease. We don’t know first hand what it looks or feels like to suffer from these vaccine preventable diseases. So we have started to think that maybe vaccines are more harmful than the diseases themselves. They’re not. We have stated to think that maybe we would be better off without them. We wouldn’t. We have started to think that the negligible amount of aluminum in vaccines (which is far lower than the amount consumed every single day given it’s abundance) somehow is more harmful than the effects of these diseases. And, sure, we should work to improve vaccines to calm these fears, no matter how disproportionate the fear may be. But I have almost no tolerance left for the misinformation. To me, anti-vaxx has become synonymous with misinformed, whether that’s fair or not. 

There are indeed two sides to this, but they’re not both equally right or worthy of consideration. This isn’t a mere difference of opinion in which both opinions should be equally respected. This isn’t “hotdogs are better than hamburgers.” That’s a matter of taste, a matter of opinion, there’s no right or wrong answer there, and either way, it does no harm. This...this isn’t that. All available evidence shows that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks, all statistics show that the benefits outweigh the risks, and while that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be working to improve the safety of vaccines no matter how statistically safe they are, it does mean that vaccines are better than no vaccines. And in the case of vaccines, we need the majority of people to be on board, at least for those vaccines that have existed and have been studied for a long time . Herd immunity is real. The horrific effects of vaccine preventable disease are real. The risk of having a serious reaction to a vaccine is literally about one in a million. The risk of dying from or being disfigured or otherwise injured by the diseases they prevent is high. 

I respect whatever choice you want to make regarding the Covid vaccine. I respect whatever choice you want to make regarding any other vaccine. Those who are skeptical about the Covid vaccine aren’t anti-vaccine, and those who are anti-vaccine are rare. They’re a minority, and as long as they continue to be a minority (and I believe they will, because I believe that the evidence supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines), then, I don’t care what they do or don’t do with their bodies. I think that it’s high time that, as a society, we compassionately address the concerns that vaccine hesitant people have. We’ll be better off for it. And we definitely shouldn’t stop trying to improve the already good safety profile of vaccines. But I will never believe that a blanket anti-vaccine attitude is something that should just be accepted and equally valued in society. Until someone is able to concretely evidence that vaccination is more harmful than not vaccinating, I’m going to be pro-vaccine and I’m going to think that it’s senseless to not receive approved and well studied vaccines that protect the individual and society as a whole, and I will not accept this as a difference of opinion because facts aren’t opinions.",mo2pnd,2021-04-11 06:04:53

"I don’t think that we can say that people on “OP’s side” aren’t willing to converse. OP clearly is. And I don’t think that we should ever dismiss someone who is willing to converse. If someone is willing have a discussion, they’re often willing to consider the arguments or points presented by the other side. They want to hear what we have to say. They haven’t made up their minds all the way just yet. They’re open to hearing all sides. We shouldn’t ever just shut that down and assume that it’s not a discussion worth having. That’s such a divisive way of thinking, and it’s part of the reason why we find ourselves hopelessly deadlocked against other humans who we are falsely assuming to be our enemy. 

Maybe I’m wrong, but it’s my belief that part of the reason why anti-vaccine populations have been growing is because they aren’t being heard. They aren’t being heard by the people who need to listen. People just dismiss their concerns and assume that because they question things about vaccines, that they are insane conspiracy theorists who aren’t worthy of our time. That they are just crazy anti-science people who can’t be saved. But what is science really? It’s asking questions, and trying to find the answer. Every good scientist is a person who makes an observation, asks a question, and tries to answer it. So if someone asks a question, and you think that you have the information and evidence to answer it, answer it. 

The truly anti-vaxx population is small. The vaccine hesitant population is much larger. And it’s our job as pro-vaccine people to hear our the vaccine hesitant and to attempt to answer their questions and provide them factual information. If we don’t do it, the anti-vaxx communities will win. This person wasn’t being disrespectful to us or our views. Saying “oh people like you never listen anyway” is dismissive, and it drives vaccine hesitant people straight into the arms of the anti-vaxxers.

"Well, maybe I just like to argue because I know we are right, but I really do think that part of the problem with  vaccine hesitant people and the growing ranks of the anti-vaxxers is that anti-vaxxers get to these people first. And they explain their bullshit conspiracy theories that have been disproven time and time again in a way that makes sense to some people. They target vaccine hesitant people, and reel them in, one by one, each time making it harder to dig ourselves out of this awful hole. Can you imagine what would happen if this movement gained enough of a foothold to derail even more of our herd immunities than they already have? It would be a nightmare, so many people would die needlessly all because of misinformation and anti-vaxx fear mongering. The entire anti-vaxx community is one large fallacy, one large product of the effects of availability bias. Vaccines are so effective that people aren’t dying awful deaths from communicable disease, so these people somehow assume that vaccines are worse than the diseases they prevent. 

I wish that this wasn’t even a conversation we needed to be having. I don’t think it’s a conversation that we need to have at all. I’m all for “hey, let’s make safe things even safer,” but we shouldn’t be having to fight this anti-vaxx scourge because it’s all a load of total bullshit that has been debunked over and over by thousands of credible and reputable sources. It frustrates me, that’s why I studied anti-vaxxers in school, defended a thesis about them, wrote many more papers about them...I’ve studied the ins and outs of the anti-vaccine movement thoroughly. And while I know, and you know, that their arguments are baseless and that there’s no way in this universe that refusing vaccination is better for humans than vaccination, that their movement is so riddled with bias and fallacy that it’s laughable, vaccine hesitant people still exist. And when they exist, it can go one of two ways. Either they get so heavily indoctrinated into the anti-vaxx cult that they lose touch with reality entirely, or they come to understand the benefit, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines. 

We want the latter to happen. Studies have shown that the anti-vaccine movement is taking over, their groups online are taking over, they have more of a presence than pro-vaccine groups, and it’s frightening. If pro-vaccine people (eg. you and I) don’t stand up, shout louder, meet people where they are at more often, show compassion instead of contempt (contempt makes people defensive and shut down), and take every opportunity to dispel this nonsense with empirical fact, things are going to get worse. We are going to see even more eradicated or nearly eradicated diseases resurface, just as measles has. I believe that one remedy to this problem is to compassionately but firmly take any chance presented to us to provide factual information, from credible sources, every single time. We have truth on our side. We should use it. We never know the motivations of the person asking questions. Maybe they’re just an anti-vaxx troll, or maybe they’re just a vaccine hesitant person who needs to be herd and provided factual information. 

Just my two cents. I don’t think that ignoring the problem will help, because every person who has questions will eventually get them answered, and we better hope it’s not by the anti-vaxxers. I understand your frustration. In my line of work, for the last two years, I have had to deal with anti-vaxxers daily.

The only reason their still screetching, is because we're still screetching back. At this point though. We have to be louder than they are. We have to be more aggressive than they are.

"I mean, I definitely think we are on the same page here. Perhaps we just have different ways of expressing it. And I sure as hell agree that we need to be louder, that’s what I’ve been saying this whole time - for years. Be louder. Right now, they’re still a minority. We are a majority with facts and truth on our side. Every doctor, every scientist, every virologist, every epidemiologist, every immunologist, every other pro-vaccine person needs to be screaming louder than this fucking asinine cult of misinformed humans (and I’m referencing true anti-vaxxers here). I 100% agree. 

But how do we make that happen, on a large scale? What do you suggest? I’m only one person, and I suppose I’ve been trying my best as one person to reach other people, one person at a time. As a society, what do you suggest? And is it actionable? Because as much as I’d support a policy being enacted tomorrow at the federal level (I’m in the U.S.) that says “unless you have a true, evidenced, real, actual medical condition that keeps you from getting vaccinated, then you need to be vaccinated if you want to participate in this society,” I don’t see that happening. I don’t see ANYONE, not even the people who should be, taking bold action. So what can we do, aside from try to dispel the bullshit? I’m all ears, but I don’t think that mocking an individual is a good way to get through to them. I’m down for bold action, it’s our country that isn’t, and it won’t be, until we have run our immunities into the ground and people are dying. It’s our country that won’t consider acting until we welcome smallpox back into our homes with open arms because of FrEeDoM to be a dangerous idiot. And even then, personal liberties will likely be seen as more important than saving lives.

"No, having a severe adverse reaction to a vaccine absolutely, patently does not make you anti-vaccine. There are several medical conditions, including previous moderate or severe adverse reactions to a vaccine, that would render a person incapable of being vaccinated, and those reasons are legitimate and worthy of further study and consideration within the communities of professionals capable of conducting such research. I’m sure that it’s unlikely that you’ve read any of my other informal online commentary about the anti-vaccine movement or my more formal works written about it, but if you had, you would know that I would never say that someone who has a medical condition (a previous severe adverse reaction included) preventing them from being vaccinated constitutes being anti-vaccine. I would never say that we should disregard people like you. If anything, I’d say that we should work tirelessly as a society to make sure that people who cannot be vaccinated due to such medical conditions are protected. In no way does your experience make you anti-vaccine. It makes you a person who can’t be vaccinated, or at least receive that specific vaccine / vaccine ingredient, and needs to be protected by those who can. 

Let me explain the conditions that I consider to be either necessary or sufficient for a person to be considered an anti-vaxxer: 

1. This person has no known medical condition that would prevent them from being vaccinated. 

2. This person is opposed to vaccination as a whole, as a general practice, rather than being opposed to a single vaccination, the shady practices of pharmaceutical companies in capitalist countries, or instead of favoring an alternative schedule of vaccination as long as all vaccines are eventually received within an appropriate timeframe (this would be more indicative of vaccine hesitancy). 

3. This person has never experienced or personally witnessed any form of severe adverse vaccine reaction and if they have, they apply this to vaccines in general rather than to the specific circumstances that contributed to the event. 

4. This person has fallen victim to identifiable cognitive bias and/ or logical fallacy. 

5. This person, despite possessing no current qualifying credentials to do so, claims that vaccines are unsafe or ineffective, and discourages others from being vaccinated despite their lack of qualification to make any scientifically valid assessment about vaccine safety or efficacy. 

6. This person refuses to acknowledge or accept a preponderance of scientific evidence to the contrary of their position. 

So no, I would not consider you anti-vaccine given the circumstances you have outlined and I believe that you have misrepresented not only my argument, but everything that I stand for (though you’d have no knowledge of the latter). 

To assume that my knowledge of vaccines comes from the media, Facebook memes, or Reddit is laughable. My knowledge of vaccines comes from formal postsecondary education in the field of biology. And, while I’m in no way claiming to be an immunologist, epidemiologist, virologist, or even a remarkable biologist, I understand the science, I understand the statistics (likely more than most), I understand the good and evil of US pharmaceutical companies, and I understand the societal benefit of vaccination. All medial interventions carry risks and benefits. All of them. Does that mean we shouldn’t work to reduce those risks? No way. But it’s just the way it goes when it comes to the human body within an imperfect society. 

I’m sorry that you went through what you went through. I’m a strong advocate for bettering our current technologies. Even though the odds of a severe adverse reaction to vaccines are statistically incredibly low, it happens. And for the people it happens to, it’s awful. And I’d never for a second say that your experience and resulting view on vaccines makes you anti-vaxx, or a conspiracy theorist, or anything other than a human who went through something awful and is deserving of empathy and compassion, as well as to be heard and considered. I myself have been the one out of X, the person to suffer the statistically improbable. And for that reason, I do believe we should never stop making it a goal to improve vaccines. But at the risk of sounding insensitive (and I’m not, I’m actually a very empathetic person and when other people hurt, I hurt), we need to consider the whole picture here, while doing our best every day to make any medical intervention as safe as we can strive for. I don’t know the whole story about your allergic reaction / immune response of another cause. Many things can cause anaphylaxis, people are allergic to many things, immune responses can be triggered by things that are not usually harmful to the human body, and while it’s awful, it doesn’t mean that these things deserve to be banned, or viewed unfavorably. 

Based on the available scientific evidence, I still believe that vaccination is better than no vaccination, it’s far better than the effects of the diseases it prevents, and we should do our best as a society to make this great medical intervention as safe as it can possibly ever be. 

Addressing the problems within our pharmaceutical industry would be a good start, but how do we address an industry that is beneficial yet corrupted by greed, that places money before humans, in a country that literally thrives on the practice of placing money before humans? Whatever issues exist with pharmaceutical companies are systemic, they are a result of society as a whole. They aren’t isolated to this one industry. So how to fix them without fixing society as a whole? Beats me, but let’s not assume that all scientists who work for pharma companies are bad, or that all things created by pharma companies are bad. I know from intimate first hand experience that’s not true. Let’s not assume that the scientists who work on developing these medical interventions are inevitably corrupt. They aren’t. I promise you that much. It’s just educated people doing their jobs, right now, as we speak. The bad actors don’t speak for everyone. Not sure if that’s what you meant by conflicts of interest but, at the end of the day, those are happening much higher up. 

So I hope that this addressed your questions, and clarified my stance on the issues you brought up.",mo2pnd,2021-04-13 10:27:49

That's not to say that everyone doesn't suffer from confirmation bias or change resistance, but for these people it becomes a way of life. Personally I think that the role that religion used to play in a lot of people's lives - bringing balance, a sense of community with a common belief, giving simple answers to difficult questions and just generally giving purpose to a purposeless universe - is being replaced by these conspiracies.

This new type of vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, it's a gene implant.  It's totally different but you can bet that anti-vax people are really not trusting this now, and for good reason.  You shouldn't just inject yourself with random things, and the government doesn't do well looking after everyone's health.  It's not been the case in the past, why now?   I'd say it makes sense, even if the vaccine is fine, even the manufacturers had doubts in the last year that it was even possible.  Also, it doesn't work all the way and it doesn't protect others so what's the point?  It just doesn't make sense and that's why people are suspicious of the vax.",mma0gh,2021-04-09 01:08:12

Have you forgotten the reason we were worried was hospitals being flooded and not being able to treat this very treatable disease because people like you *wanted* it in droves? Doctors and nurses were in short supply because of how many patients there were and them also getting sick. 

Once we got the case numbers down, we started to worry about the long term effects. You know, what people might have to deal with for the rest of their lives? The internal scars on the lungs and brain fogs that persisted for months or even to now. 

Then there's also the fact that the American people were losing money just staying inside all year and needed regular stimulus(most Americans didn't have enough money to cover a few thousand dollar emergency and that was *before* the pandemic). Oh right, that was shit on for months by the GOP because ""you should be able to pick yourself up from your bootstraps"", you know, from a years worth of rent/utilities debt while also not working or getting help from your government(the people you elected to help you).

More money is allocated to hospitals the more “covid” patients they take in/ people they put on ventilators.

One glass had a straight neck that has a perfect shot to the solution. The other one had a bunch of curves. 

After waiting awhile, the solution in the straight neck glass went bad while the solution in the bent glass stayed fine. They figured out the particles from the air reacting to the solution was what made it go bad and, in turn, that's also how disease was spread.

"If you read the dictionary definition of a vaccine, yes this APPEARS to be a valid argument. If you research all of the types of vaccines, it is not. COVID vaccines are vaccines. Influenza vaccines are vaccines. Tuberculosis vaccines are vaccines. The number of doses required has nothing to do with qualifying a vaccine as something else. Neither does the duration of efficacy. A vaccine is simply a medication which by either containing non-active virus or other organic or synthetic material increases your body’s ability to fight a specific disease. The COVID vaccine specifically can slow the spread and therefore slow the mutation of COVID. It also has shown (across all vendors) practically 100% efficacy at preventing severe cases and death (no deaths or severe COVID cases requiring hospitalization in any study so far). Arguing that the “shot” is “bs” undermines the actual science of the vaccine and if people listen to this argument and don’t get the vaccine, they are more likely to die from COVID. 

Edit: Spelling and grammar.",mliga7,2021-04-07 12:44:32
"I don't expect you to comprehend even my layman means explanation, but sure.

When your immune system, immunizes itself against a virus, bacteria, or anything it would identify as being a, ""disease"". It only keeps that immunity for a little while. Roughly six months max if my understanding of it is right. After that, it's possible to get the same exact disease again later down the road despite, ""becoming immune"" to it earlier. Calling it an immunity is unfortunately a poor choice of words because of this. It's more like a, ""resistance"" to the disease.

It's one of the reasons something like a cold can be caught, and then caught again the very next year. That same cold you became, ""immune"" to previously is no longer in what passes for your immune systems memory, and it has to go through the process all over again. That, in turn, is also why you need a flu shot once a year. The strains of flu in a given area, after you gain your immunity to them, are no longer in your systems, ""memory"". 

So instead of exposing yourself to a live strain of the virus, being out if commision for a week, and depending on how weak your system is to begin with, die fron something that on the surface is just giving you the sniffles and a bad cough, and yes, a mere flu CAN do this to a person. Instead, a benign version of the exact same flu can be injected into your system that your body can attack, and gain the information it needs to actively go after any live strains that might enter your system after.",mliga7,2021-04-16 06:50:04

"In short (especially when talking about COVID-19 vaccines), NO.

Going into details there is some truth to it, however, it’s not as bad as this flyer makes it seem.

Yes, some vaccines do contain adjuvants (such as aluminium) to stimulate immune response and lower the amount of antigens needed to make the vaccine effective. Is it dangerous? Not really, the ammounts found in vaccines are completely safe for humans.

Formaldehyde is also used in some vaccines as a means of inactivating or killing the virus inside so it does not do any damage, but still be recognizable to our immune system. This way we can build an immunity to it without developing any (serious) symptoms. While it is true that formaldehyde is a carcinogen, your body produces magnitudes more formaldehyde per day than you will receive with any vaccine.

Any references to animal or fetal cells are a gross exaggeration. They are not “supposed” to be in vaccines, as they serve no role in building immunity. They are however used in the production of vaccines and may sometimes appear on ingredient lists in case a stray cell or two “escapes” the purifying process. These are however very quickly “eaten” and dissolved by macrophages in the body and cause no harm.
The reason we use them in the production process at all is that viruses cannot replicate without host cells, and it is much better to use cell lines, than to inject live animals and try to extract the replicated virus from them. This would dramatically decrease yields and add a huge variable to the production process which is never a good thing.

Now on to COVID-19 vaccines:
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not contain ANY of the DeMoNiC sUbStAnCeS listed on the flyer as they are not needed; not in production, nor the final product. mRNA vaccines which use liposomes can be made without viral replication in host cells (because they are not viruses), they do not need adjuvants and they should not contain any formaldehyde as it could react with the mRNA, drastically decreasing the already short use-by date.
Looking at the ingredient list of these two vaccines may be scary with long ass names such as 
((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate) or 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine however looking at the structure of them reveals that in reality the vaccines only contain mRNA, lipids (which form the liposome and are broken down or integrated into the host cell membrane), buffers (so that the vaccine doesn’t change our blood pH), and salt and sugar (so that the vaccine is isotonic and doesn’t cause hemolysis).

Adenoviral vaccines such as Sputnik V or Vaxzevria also do not contain adjuvants and mustn’t contain formaldehyde because they use live viruses as vectors for the mRNA. Basically instead of using the liposome for transferring mRNA to host cells they use a live, custom made virus. While this is completely safe it carries a higher risk for fever after administration, which should subside in a day or two. But because they use viruses as vectors cell lines have to be used in the production process.

TL;DR
This flyer doesn’t apply to COVID vaccines, and is generally full of misinformation.",mjkea6,2021-04-04 08:41:45

"None of these vaccines have been proven to be effective in even stopping covid though. I know multiple people who have been fully vaccinated and got covid anyway. There is absolutely ZERO proof that these vaccines even WORK. And most vaccines need at least 5-10 years of trials. Not to mention animal trials first. But there was none of this with these vaccines (mainly because the animals all died in similar vaccine trials-- for sars, etc). The humans are the guinea pigs. I will never take an MRNA vaccine, or anything with spike proteins (such as J&J's). But thank you and good luck to you.",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 02:15:51

I think you're right. There is no other excuse for people to not be ALLOWED to be against these highly dangerous covid vaccines they are rushing out. And I DO mean rushing. My boyfriend works in the medical industry and KNOWS that all legit vaccines have to be tested for a MINIMUM of 5-10 years before giving them to people. The people getting these vaccines now are like actual guinea pigs. It's really sad because I honestly believe many of them will have horrific health problems if not die in the near future. I was told anywhere from months to years after getting one of these vaccines (and some really unfortunate people die within days or HOURS after getting it).,mk3ieq,2021-04-05 02:22:18

"J&J uses traditional vaccine technology. I'm not sure what your understanding of ""anything with spile proteins"" is, but it sounds misguided. Basically they use that instead of a weakened virus as the vehicle to introduce your body to covid, which is brilliant and safer. The flu shot is new every year, but it's safe because the technology is tried and true. The mrna vaccines are new, but the technology was in the works for decades. Recoding them to block covid only took a few days -- the rest of the time has been using studies.

I was a guinea pig for J&J. You would not be. The trial has over 100k participants in multiple countries, with people from a variety of races and age groups. It involves collecting a great deal of evidence, including keeping a diary of any symptoms as well as regular blood tests, swabs, monitoring heart rate and 02 levels, etc. The only substantial adverse reactions were in people with preexisting autoimmune problems. 

There is tons of evidence that the vaccines work. Your anecdotes are nice, but the actual scientific studies done on these vaccines show that they are overwhelmingly effective at stopping covid and/or making symptoms much more bearable. J&J is in the 70s percentage-wise at stopping transmission and above 90% at stopping serious symptoms/death. The only thing we don't know is the length of time for which they are effective, so it's important to get to herd immunity quickly.

I personally have had multiple exposures and not gotten covid, even though everyone else in my household got a very nasty strain from which they are long-haulers. My dad is in pain every day and has been for nearly six months, while I've been protected from that this whole time. It's really tough to see him struggling to breathe and move, and I am so grateful to J&J for sparing me from that for myself.",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 03:24:46

"Okay, to clear up some issues:
1. [There is proof](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) that the vaccines work in preventing the coronavirus. Not all vaccines work to 100% prevent immunity forever. Some require booster shots every once and a while, and some are meant to lessen the symptoms of whatever disease they are fighting against, and dont always work 100% of the time in everyone (think influenza and HPV.) 

For more articles regarding vaccine trials, [Go here](https://www.nejm.org/search?q=covid+19+vaccine&asug=Covid)

2. Animal trials were performed along side human clinical trials. The FDA wouldn't allow this step to be bypassed completely, so they established animal trials in monkeys and mice. Once enough time had passed and no symptoms were presented, they moved on. I wish someone would site me the article for the apparent Cov-1 vaccine experiment, I haven't seen it, but in short many people have been vaccinated and exposed to covid consistently. There is no real evidence that the corona virus utilizes antibody-dependent enhancement. A lot more people would be dropping dead and this issue would have been noticed 

3. The way vaccine trials work is by using multiple trial steps that require a long confirmation and examination process. The covid vaccine was developed quickly by many factors:
-long term exposure could be monitored in phase three, as patients who had the dose were constantly exposed to the coronavirus due to a lack of preventative measures, yet few were sick.
-animal trials were allowed to be quickly conducted and examined due to a crisis. It is because of the crisis that covid trials were top priority, being able to be reviewed as soon as an article was created. Alot of the procedures done for each phase of vaccine development could be streamlined, as the resources were available and the models were quick and easy to find.

3. It's important to get vaccinated as this prevents the virus from having vectors and spreading. Less spread, less chance of dangerous mutations occurring in the virus as well as protection of vulnerable members of our community.

4. I read a few cases of individuals dying of the vaccine. Those cases involved 80-90 year old individuals dying suddenly. One man that was 66 was killed by a heart attack in the records. Do you think there may have been some other reasons these individuals died? Even if these individuals did die by the vaccine, the numbers show that the odds of dying are 0.0068%, compared to the 1.8% chance of death from covid cases (not to mention long term effects from the disease in those that survive, and the suffering endured in severe cases compared to side effects from the vaccine.)",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 03:53:07
That's nice,mk3ieq,2021-04-05 02:48:28
"They're called ""spike proteins,"" look them up. You're not getting my point though. I never said that NO vaccines EVER work. But the problem is, in order to know if they do or not, and even if they're SAFE FOR HUMANS, you have to wait YEARS. This was the most rushed vaccine in history and so far, it's been a disaster. The MSM is a water carrier for Moderna, J&J, etc. but there have been MANY deaths and many more horrific injuries from these very vaccines... So much so that the CDC (hardly a ""fringe group"") has admitted as much. I believe my mom and I had covid back in Feb. We had many of the symptoms that lasted a long time. I'm in my 30's, she's in her 60's. When you get covid though, you develop antibodies. Your own immune system will do this naturally and actually give you FAR greater protection than any vaccine. Vaccines tend to suppress your immune system. And being that covid is similar to the cold/flu, it keeps changing ANYWAY, thus making these vaccines even MORE unnecessary and worthless. So you can be ""grateful"" to J&J, but I promise you, within months or a few years time, you won't be. And you will also have had probably a few MORE strains of covid by that time too.",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 03:51:53
"I have done the ""research"" actually, which is why I don't buy into the vaccine pushers. I feel sad for you because you are a perfect example of what I'm talking about but don't even realize it. Good luck taking your death shot.",mk3ieq,2021-04-06 13:49:25
"Oh dear. I truly don't have the time to get to all your incorrect points. But search the internet. It's not all ""80 and 90 year olds"" who are dying from this vaccine. And many more have serious health problems from it. And as I wrote to the above pro-vaxxer, these vaccines are completely USELESS anyway, as they cannot isolate the virus-- therefore, they will never work. But you'd have to have a medical background (as I do, actually) to grasp that.",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 04:17:00
"I know what spike proteins are. I think your understanding of how they work in vaccines is wrong. Your understanding of vaccines ""suppressing"" your immune system is definitely wrong. Yes, some people have bad reactions to vaccines. But the overwhelming majority do not, and getting the vaccine will keep the most vulnerable people safe.

Most vaccines do take years. This is in part because we want to study long-term effects, yes, but it's also because we have multiple rounds of trials to test a larger sample of people. In this case, with J&J at least, they stacked the rounds/moved the rounds closer together so that they tested the same or even larger numbers of people faster. I've already been vaxxed for six months and no trouble in sight. It is extremely unlikely that I have adverse effects in the future. If I get cancer in the future it is much more likely to come from my diet than this. 

I'm glad you were fine after getting covid, but many people are not. We've lost more than half a million people in the US, and millions globally. Not to mention people who are suffering long-term or permanently.

The only reason covid is going to mutate and make my vaccine useless is that antivaxxers refuse to take the vaccine but insist on interacting with each other unsafely. Studies are showing that immunity from getting covid is much shorter-lived than immunity from the vaccine. I know at least one chronic partier who has had covid four times, each time worse than the last.",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 04:02:23

"I have a background in microbiology. I had professors sending me articles on these studies while some clinical trials were taking place in the city I lived in. Most vaccines dont use live virus; most use  disabled virus or viral antigen using a carrier virus such as the adenovirus. That former use is actually how johnson and johnson deploys their vaccine compared to mRNA. Even then, mRNA is PCR'd to produce only the spike protein. Feel free to send me some of those death examples though, and to read those articles I posted showing they they aren't actually useless.",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 04:24:26
"Your last paragraph is a blatant lie. That is NOT the only reason covid is ""going to mutate."" Because people like me, my boyfriend, my parents, etc. all have the GOOD SENSE to not get injected with this kill shot. The REAL reason the vaccine is useless is because vaccines for colds and flus just don't work. Anyone who tells you otherwise is LYING. And a lot of people WANT to believe this lie because it comforts them. I'm telling you from a medical standpoint, I am 100% CERTAIN they won't work. And it has nothing to do with who gets them and who doesn't. You have to isolate a specific virus for a vaccine to work-- period. They were never able to do this with covid (look it up if you don't believe me). And they also marked many deaths as ""covid"" that weren't in order to create hysteria. They clearly want to keep us in a state of constant lock-down/vaccines. They want a controlled population. That's all this is really about. But I'm certain you won't agree, as you've already swallowed the kool-aid, and unfortunately, took a vaccine that will likely lead to your demise.",mk3ieq,2021-04-05 04:13:14

And that's great that you also have a medical background. Google Dr. Sherri Tenpenny or Dr. Lorraine Day-- both of whom have DECADES of experience on this subject... listen to what THEY say.

"I mean statically, yes

More people have died while using a seatbelt.

People who smoke, live longer than non smokers. 

People who drank any water are more likely to get more diseases than someone who never drank any water

But statistics are more likely to be wrong than right

85% of Americans wear seatbelts so that means majority of the deaths caused via accidents are more likely to be by someone who use a seatbelt

You have to be 21, or atleast of age to be able to smoke, and many babies and toddlers die. so that means majority of the smokers are likey to outlive non smokers

If you never had any H2O in your life you'll die, usually without having any time for any diseases to infect you.

Because funnily enough, 131,880 people will die of lung cancer [annually](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/about/key-statistics.html) where as approximately 375,000 people died of [COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm), roughly 3 times as many people. 

According to this article, [62.4%](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/87230) of people with severe cases did not have an underlying conditioned outlined in table 1. While underlying conditions do increase the risk of severe outcomes and older people are more susceptible to severe outcomes, chances of these issues afflicting healthy people are not absent. 

To give an idea how many people are at risk due to an underlying condition or age, about [40%](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/how-many-adults-are-at-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus/) of people are at risk for developing severe conditions.

Or they love to say it’s the masks working,mi0532,2021-04-01 23:13:14
This is a question for r/Immunology,mi2byu,2021-04-01 20:08:02
"If you are looking for a general hypothesis, my best bet would be that yes, she may still have an amped up immune system from her previous infection, so when the immune system recognized the protein, it kicked into overdrive and dealt with the proteins. She may have a hypersensitive immune system like that, but I'd agree with posting in r/immunology to get the full scope.",mi2byu,2021-04-01 21:56:40
"I have some theories. I'm hesitant to share them cause I frankly have no education in this area, its mostly me just making things up based on stuff I've heard. Don't take my theories as fact, I'm not an expert.

I've heard that people who have had the virus have a stronger reaction to the vaccine in general. Also, younger people tend to have a stronger reaction , and women tend to have a stronger reaction. This person appears to fall into all of those groups.

I personally think the idea of ""tested positive"" leads people to believe they ""had"" or ""didn't have"" the virus. As if it's a binary situation, that there's only two possible options here. I think that this leads us away from considering that people might have been exposed to a lot of the virus or a little of the virus, and I believe that concept is described as ""viral load"". I'd think that being exposed to a little of the virus would help you to build immunity, but might lead to a mild/asymptomatic case.

Once you get the vaccine, you're suddenly exposed to a lot of the virus-like substance via injection. Your body suddenly sees a ton of it and suddenly says ""I remember this guy, he was terrible, I gotta kick into high gear and kick his butt"". I would like this to an auto-immune response, kinda, but basically I'd think that your lymphatic system reacts strongly, and has effects on a lot of other systems of your body too.

Also, some people get nervous and might emotionally overreact to getting the vaccine and get stressed out. I know when I have been stressed, my GI has been affected. Again this is all just theory, and I don't want to discredit this person and say she is overreacting or anything like that, because I really have no information about her except for this account, but I'd say she should take care of herself leading up to the second shot, and go into it with a relaxed mindset and have lots of distractions for de-stressing her mind during the few days after the second shot. I'm not sure if that would help, probably couldn't hurt anything to be less stressed.

I just listened to a podcast episode with an immunologist from Vox's ""Today Explained"", Episode: ""My friend has a question about the vaccine"". It talked about a lot of interesting aspects from an educated perspective that is better than mine. Link below:
https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Yxn7kwjOsnBBoaMuLIBU1?si=r-q9a_T_SA-hvffu-JAzsQ

In short, get the vaccine, take care of yourself, communicate with your medical professionals.",mi2byu,2021-04-03 16:50:59
"I mean yeah but there's just as much content in the post about the vaccine as there is about immunity. Don't just look at the link, the whole purpose of that is to back up a single point, the questions I'm asking are about the vaccine. That's the most important part. Do you have any answers in mind for the questions?",mi2byu,2021-04-01 20:12:24
"That offers a fair amount of insight, enough to where id be confident going forward rather than worrying. I guess the only question that remains open is to why MRNA ad opposed to a ""dead virus"" or whatever was traditionally used. Id say that's really the root of the uncomfortability for me, just because its more novel and in the area of the unknown... Ill check out the link maybe I'll find something there, but yeah when I hear MRNA I just start thinking ""oh it's fucking with your genetics, its entering your cells and changing what they do, what are the long term effects? From where can I read about it's safety?"" And then whenever I try to dig all the sources say ""it's safe!"" But I never get an explanation as to why or a citation to a study so it's very worrying, but that's just me.. I worry too much. I don't know, I'll read the link and ask r/immunology. Thank you though you really did clear up alot of confusion and anxiety so I appreciate it",mi2byu,2021-04-03 17:19:37
"Vaccines are all about immunity and therefore on topic for [r/Immunology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Immunology/)

This is a rather technical question, and r/AntiVaxxers a meme and general discussion sub, while [r/Immunology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Immunology/) is a scientific sub better suited for such technical questions",mi2byu,2021-04-01 21:26:02
"I've never heard anyone say that mRNA would enter your cells and change your genetics. That seems like a weird statement.

In addition, the podcast link I provided is a Q&A with a immunologist (maybe that's the wrong title) who has been researching mRNA vaccines in a scientific setting for over 30 years.

I think the real problem with trying to find a study that states ""it's safe"" is that a lot of the scientific language used gets misinterpreted by normal people, who then end up discrediting the conclusion by saying they ""just have questions"".

For instance, software commonly uses higher security methods of data transmission nowadays, such as https. I guarantee you I could find mentions of ""security concerns"" in technology papers and dissertations that would cause people to ""just have questions"", about things like https technology, but no normal people are reading those. It's all just boring drivel to them. But for some reason all these anti-vaxxers are just overthinking it and reading into stuff they are uneducated about. That's how I figure it anyway.",mi2byu,2021-04-03 18:35:39
Oh shit I didn't realize I stumbled onto a meme sub,mi2byu,2021-04-01 23:15:01
"I can admit that my ""just had questions"" thing had a bias to it. I think what I had going on in my head was that I had a bias, I already was believing that the vaccine was bad, and in order to get the answers I wanted, I felt as though I had to make the post seem more docile so it wouldn't cause an inflammatory argumentative response. I can say deep down in my heart, I was looking for answers or lack therof to support what I already assumed. This was all subconscious, I do have manipulative tendencies, and had you not pointed it out, I wouldn't have noticed that was what I was doing, so thank you very much for recognizing that and calling it out.
I know that you already knew my intentions as soon as you read the post, I just had to do a recap in words so I can own it.

The whole ""entering the cell, changing genetics"" statement was really just me being uneducated and having a warped understanding on what actually goes on. I had heard it goes through the cell wall but not the nucleus and then causes the production of a protein, that would have been a better way to word it.

Also thank you for a link that gave me education on the subject. 30 years of experience is enough to put my mind at ease, I'm glad that now I can worry less because I know more, there's so many articles on ""the basic"" questions when I use something like google. I was digging through page upon page and I all I wanted was a deeper understanding so I appreciate you for that.

I didn't mean to that ""just have a few questions"" guy.. my bad on that. I live with this guy and he's so into all the underground conspiracy shit regarding the virus and vaccine and everytime I'm in the room with him he tells me another scary thing. Over time it seems to have effected me via osmosis.",mi2byu,2021-04-03 18:59:16

"I have not. But with the covid, I'm not sure if the weakened version applies because virus are clinically dead when they're inactive. I thought that they were just putting another strain of the virus in the vaccines, which is not deadly, but close enough to the original that the body can still recognise it. It's also one of the reasons that it won't work the way other vaccines do.

Atleast, that's what I understood. I can read the paper, but I'm not doctor.

"That’s an interesting question with a lot of nuanced answers. It’s not a black and white yes or no answer. I’m sure no matter how I answer I’ll come across as a hypocrite with double standards but I’ll try anyways. 

If there was a easy and effective cure that won’t bankrupt people then yes I am against it. On that note I don’t believe in universal Heath care and I don’t believe my tax dollars should be used to treat your own stupidity if you cut off a hand and you don’t have insurance. I’m ok with tax dollars funding a cure but I don’t believe a private company with a government funded cure research should be able to make a cure so over priced eg: costs 5$ to make they sell for 100$

If the vaccine was fool proof 100% effective and people who can’t normally get vaccines are able to take this then yes I’m against it. At that point it’s a risk you can take without harming other people, this isn’t the case though. I would expect someone who traveled to Africa with an Ebola outbreak who didn’t take a vaccine to isolate and not go anywhere, why should I be forced to take a vaccine for something I would of never been exposed to if you didn’t go to Africa. Same thing with covid and at risk people, I would want you to jump through some hoops before you walked into a nursing home if you didn’t get the covid vaccine.

If it was like other vaccines, MMR and polio for example, that will literally wipe out the disease then no I’m for it being required. Most people don’t remember polio or the vaccine that came out and I kind of look at this as akin to this, I don’t remember lol but my grandmother does. 

I could go on but I’m sure I’ve contradicted myself enough already. Like I said it’s nuanced and not black and white so different factors and results of those factors could get me to flip flop instantly. 

Most my beliefs are do what you want as long as I don’t have to pay for it,  physically or monetarily. My original post turned into a rant because I was pissed they put me in the situation where I lose time with my family and there is the possibility I infect my 3 year old when I have done everything I can to protect him. I never gave him crap or looked down on him for not getting the shot when he could it was his choice, now I hope he does get one or I will demand he wear a mask in any building or around me per company policy.",mg72ss,2021-04-01 00:17:28

"We are in a global setting, not everywhere has paid maternity leave. I live in one of the more progressive states in USA and you only get unpaid maternity leave. A lot of companies in USA just expect existing employees to pick up the extra work with normal hourly rates.

They were still making a huge profit on top of it.",mg72ss,2021-03-30 21:23:08
"I’m sorry that happened to your cousin that is just ridiculous. There isn’t any union for us in my state, either you are a municipal employee or you are a contract employee.

"That is where you have to decide your worth and be willing to walk if the company refuses to negotiate. I used to work for a petroleum distribution transport company. I was making the owner roughly 20,000 a night (material profit not including office overhead). I was doing double the work in half the time.  

The owner cut 5 drivers, doubled the 4 other guys and my workload and paid us the same rate. I told him meet me half way, so instead of paying me 1,200 a week I was expecting 1,800. He refused to pay me 10% of the profits even though he was paying his sales reps 15% for really doing nothing.  

I walked, he begged me to come back 7 times over a years time. Each time I offered him to hire me back at the rate I asked previously, he claimed he couldn't even though he was buying his 2 kids brand new cars, paying them 100k+ a year and bought them each brand new 500k houses. So I upped my price 100 each time. Last time he begged me I was at 2,500 a week.  

Morale is, know your worth, stand your ground and don't let anyone take advantage of you. He never gave in but the whole time I was making the 1,800 a week with another company that saw my worth and agreed to pay me such.  

Fun fact, he went out of business and works in a similar position to me now.",mg72ss,2021-03-30 23:54:10
"That's hilarious. I was offered more money at a different job when I was working what had previously been 3 full time employees jobs, with a part time workload added on.

They were unable to find a replacement, ever. Keeps getting reposted as an available job every 1-3 months.",mg72ss,2021-03-31 01:12:24

Lmao so everyone is gonna say “yeh I didn’t get vaccinated” and get a free membership whilst still wearing their mask and being vaccinated. I’d love to see how quickly his business goes down if he genuinely thinks this is a smart business decision,mbt7g9,2021-03-24 03:55:49
I wish we had a local Krispy Kreme. :(,mbt7g9,2021-03-24 04:33:05
Good business model. You get to drive your paying customers away while giving away free membership to customers who will slowly infect each other and die.,mbt7g9,2021-03-24 09:55:03
So ill just not bring my vaccination card to the gym and on my cheat days my ass will be at krispy Kreme. :),mbt7g9,2021-03-24 05:04:09

"That's nice and all, but the optics legitimize his statements in the eyes of the stupid. Being a gym, his resources are already purchased. It's not like he's handing out a physical product for free that he paid for out of pocket.

So unless there are enough of you to drive paying customers away, he only stands to benefit from the uptick in traffic.

Also I wouldn't trust the sanitary practices of people who don't believe in medical science.",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 14:07:41

"1. I mean you should be cleaning the gym equipment before and after you use it anyways, so like..🤷🏼‍♀️

2. It could be leased if he doesn’t have the proper investment and he could still lose it, but also, have you seen how much a membership to most gyms cost? And the contracts? It’s basically signing a contract with satan. It’s still free. Having an uptick in traffic means literally nothing when he gains zero money from it.

Edit: to the earlier comment too, it’s covid, why would you be socializing with other gym members anyways? That’s unsafe. Just put in your headphones and ignore them.",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 14:17:44
"We don't really have many small businesses here, either.",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 06:51:20
"You sanitize what you use, but it's a whole fucking building of people who don't believe in covid. Equipment isn't the only thing you touch in any building you walk into.

You using equipment he leased doesn't hurt him unless you break it. Literally no downside for him. If he makes a statement like this and it looks like his business is booming, that helps his business. Let it look like the ghost town it should be.

I didn't say socialize. I don't want to choose to spend my time in an enclosed space with covidiots. What's not to understand about that? Wearing my mask in a room full of deniers is pretty fucking stupid.",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 14:27:02
Well shit.,mbt7g9,2021-03-24 06:52:50
"You do realize hand washing and gloves among other methods exists? And again, just because it looks like his business is booming does not mean it is. If I ran a candy shop and for a week I gave away a free lollipop to everyone who walked in, no purchase required, I’ll have a lot more people in my store. But it doesn’t mean my business is booming, and I’d be taking a loss still. Looks don’t mean shit lol. Also, you again, do not need to interact with them. If an anti masked comes up, literally so easy to make up a thirty second shit story about a relative and then continue on your way and ignore them or just tell them to leave you alone. Everytime you go to the grocery store you’re surrounded by anti maskers anyways. Jesus tho, not like anyone is forcing you to sign up for shit, literally just pointing out that this is no way benefits him and easily benefits others",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 14:35:55
"We have Walmart, Burger King, McDonald's, Taco Bell, a couple Mexican restaurants, two Chinese buffets, a steakhouse, and random other chain stores like Dollar General and Dollar Tree. I order a lot of things online.",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 06:54:54
"He isn't giving away a tangible physical product. He is giving away access to something he already has. He loses NOTHING by you going there. He only benefits from the perception that you agree with him and that his business is successful. It's like you have no fucking clue how businesses operate. They use stunts with free shit to draw people in ALL THE TIME.

Me wearing a mask isn't for me, it's for the people around me. If the people around me aren't wearing one, then...??? You're also in an enclosed space with these people. It doesn't matter if they are talking or not, that's not the fucking point.

What about this do you not understand?",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 14:42:34
Guess it's better than starving,mbt7g9,2021-03-24 06:57:51
"Man, I don’t understand why you’re being a straight up dick is what I don’t understand lmfao. You are not paying him, he literally fucking earns nothing. I don’t think you understand that. His perception his beliefs are right does not equal money. I perceive my house as a gym and I’m saying people can come right in. But somehow I don’t make money from that🤣you would literally be using his electricity and showers and doing fucking nothing that makes him money. And if you only are wearing a mask for others, do you want to get covid? I mean seriously that’s just straight stupid. Does that mean you’re okay with getting covid? Because literally just for other people is not the point of wearing masks. And you say even if they’re not talking, you’re the one saying you don’t want to be in their company, easy to freaking ignore them dude. You’re also in an enclosed space, anywhere you go. You are wearing a mask and provided you can actually do that correctly and clean properly, your chances of getting it are low. Do you wanna know something? I have had to work during covid and go into work for months. Six of my coworkers have caught covid, I have not. You know why? Because I can wear my damn mask properly and take precautions.",mbt7g9,2021-03-24 14:49:40

"*ranting*

Alot of these people truly don't believe in science that has gone through testing after rigorous testing to deal with many diseases out there, yet cry to their doctor (and I'm talking about doctors that specialize in the actual medical field and not just labled as ""doctor"" based on doctorates) for something to help with symptoms on like...

"Science is not to be believed in but understood and verified. The whole concept of vaccines where you take the weakened germ and letting it trigger an immune response is pretty simple and very few people that are being labeled as “anti-vaxxers” oppose to that.

The problem with vaccines is that they have become something that is, at the very least, irrational to even ask questions about. Even if we put that aside, mandatory vaccination is worthy of opposition because it presumes that people are born faulty and do not deserve to be a part of (or that they even pose a threat to) the society until they have been “put right” by vaccination.

The whole life cycle of a vaccine is riddled with questionable incentives from the start. Manufacturers get a lot of money and are not held responsible for any harm that it might cause to those that get it. In fact, it is in their interest to preserve “the threat” that so many people are being vaccinated against.

The doctors and patients are in the same boat. Physicians risk their entire careers by simply showing hesitation towards vaccines and their patients are being ridiculed, threatened and labeled as “anti-vaxxers”, “nutjobs” and other pejorative names if they refuse to take the vaccine.

Every “conversation” about this (and I’m yet to find a meaningful one on Reddit) is filled with “Source?” and pointless linking to studies of choice on both sides. You don’t need to be pro or against vaccines to talk about whether they should be *mandatory* and what are the implications of that.

The irony is that vaccine uptake would surely be higher if they weren’t compulsory (as they currently are in many countries). Making them mandatory messes up with incentives of everyone involved and builds distrust. Not to mention that it opens the doors to forcing people to other measures that infringe their rights to their bodily autonomy.

"""my sincere condolences about the death of your baby, however, correlation is not equal causation, there is no evidence that the death of your daughter could have been related to the injection of the vaccine, if the vaccine had any allergic reactions to your baby, it would've showed up moments after the inject, many babies can die from inexplicative causes, you might be the parent but it doesn't mean you know your child, this is the definition of bad parenting, the refusal to accept things when something bad happens, just because you gave birth to a child it doesn't mean you will or ever will be able to know everything they're feeling, again, i'm sorry for the loss of your baby, my intentions are not to attack you, but please do not try to smear the reputation of vaccines over an isolated case""",mamlhl,2021-03-22 15:41:18
"There is a very very infinitesimal chance that anyone can have an adverse reaction to a vaccine (not covid-19, but in general). The US had a crisis in the 80s with people suing vaccine manufacturers because of this, and now has a list of prescribed financial remedies.

Life isn't a series of black-and-white choices. Get the vaccine for your baby, and have a tiny of them having a bad reaction. Don't get the vaccine for your baby, and have no risk of getting an infection because everyone else vaccinates their babies so there's herd immunity. Now we are at the point where there isn't herd immunity for diseases that were almost eradicated including measles because too many anti-vaxxers don't want their kid to be the one with the bad reaction, even if that means the baby could die from measles instead. 

To me, the choice is obvious: vaccinate. But others evaluate risk differently. They don't know anyone who died from a preventable childhood disease, but they see a meme like this about a baby who died from a vaccine. So they make the choice based on emotion and hope that enough people make the opposite choice to preserve herd immunity so they can free ride.",mamlhl,2021-03-22 22:15:22

If I ever have children with her I would want to make the best decision for us and others.

And for the most part, it's not about being right or wrong when it comes to people trusting the governments rolling out vaccines (this is just the way I view it in this context, others may not see it the same way), it's more about how people will trust some things but won't trust other things.",m8ahhp,2021-03-21 04:08:54

This isn't about Reddit. No one uses Reddit as evidence, it's just a place to talk. And who on earth is this guy you're talking about... Sounds like you made him up.

>I'm just saying, I'd personally trust a doctor's who have spent many years of their life researching pathogens and how to prevent spreading them m

Doctors don't research pathogens and vaccines, scientists do, pathologists do, immunologist do. Thing is, scientists work for pharmacueitcal companies.. and universities which are largely funded by pharmaceutical companies.

Plus, doctors get bonuses for vaccination records, big ones too. 40,000$ in USA for each 122 given. (Number might be slightly off I can't remember) 

>thinks the government is out to ""kill us all"" or to ""put microchips in us to track us all the time"". 

No I don't. I think the government is blackmailed by pharmaceutical lobbyists to make pharma look good, so that pharma can make less safe and quicker vaccines that make them more cash.

Also I don't believe the microchips are that big of a concern compared to health hazards.

 I've seen many people on reddit site false information (I don't have a username as of right now) who claimed that viruses can't spread because they aren't alive and didn't provide a source or adequate reasoning for it. 

>about Google is not valid because you can go away from your phone, you can't get away from tracking if it's in your arm.

The flaw with the microchips is that 1, Google already has so much data about you (location data, data about your interests, etc. I got this information from a book that I'm reading called ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"") and 2, it is impossible as of right now to fit a microchip into the diameter of a needle and have it still be able to have GPS tracking and identification of who the chip is in. Also, why would the government even need to locate you at all times. It only makes sense if you are a felon, but they already do that. And there is literally nothing else that a microchip can really do, it can't scrape your brain activity because even if it were to fit in the diameter of a needle, it's too small to get adequate readings of brain activity. 
 
>less safe and quicker vaccines that make them more cash.

If you are referring to the COVID vaccine, sure it was developed quicker than vaccines before it, but you have to realize that COVID is a disease that have affected us so much, and obviously the pharmaceutical companies would try to get the vaccine out quickly. But they still did adequate testing of it and are mostly safe. Sure you can argue that Astro-Zeneca is having the blood clot issue but that is only affecting a very slim amount of the population, 7 people have been affected out of 20 million doses in the UK (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots). 

>Doctors don't research pathogens and vaccines, scientists do, pathologists do, immunologist do. Thing is, scientists work for pharmacueitcal companies.. and universities which are largely funded by pharmaceutical companies.

They're funded by both pharma and government. 

You are incredibly wrong. 

There are literally pharmaceutical companies in Canada so you're out of your mind. They literally do their own studies. 

Vaccine manufacturers test their own vaccines, not government.

I was referring to the amount of people who have had the blood clot issues in the UK. Also, COVID-19 has killed WAY more people than the vaccine has. The benefits outweigh the harm. 

>Plus microchips are easy to make and use, so even if they aren't that useful they're worth it because they're easy

Microchips cannot fit into the standard diameter of a needle, and if you really wanted to see that there is no microchip, you can literally just ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the vaccine to show you the vile before they use it, assuming that you can see, you would be able to see a microchip in there.",m8ahhp,2021-03-21 17:04:35
">But government organizations like the FDA test the vaccines to verify that they work as well?

They do ""verify"" them but they are so bribed and cooperative with the pharmaceutical companies that they aren't very fair or bias free and also sometimes do actually lie and manipulate data to please big companies. 

Also the CDC has its own vaccine patents and makes billions from them yearly.

And, it's not just a financially motivated endeavour it's also political and philosophical, which means there's more biases even with government. Government aren't necessarily bias free!

And whether or not they are verified by government the fact still is that the studies are not top standard or even remotely close to it.

>I was referring to the amount of people who have had the blood clot issues in the UK. Also, COVID-19 has killed WAY more people than the vaccine has. The benefits outweigh the harm. 

The vaccine is new, we cannot identify it's long term outcomes yet. The thing is, I'm not saying vaccines for covid aren't useful, I just think we should give it to over 40s and people who are a bit vulnerable rather than just any old 20 year old. It's not one size fits all!

Covid is also not proven to cause as many deaths as it has been claimed to. The methods used to determine covid mortality is very flawed and means that many people will get written down as covid victims frim death from other causes just because they had positive test results.

>Microchips cannot fit into the standard diameter of a needle, and if you really wanted to see that there is no microchip, you can literally just ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the vaccine to show you the vile before they use it, assuming that you can see, you would be able to see a microchip in there.

">Even if half of the deaths aren't because of COVID, that's still over 1 million people worldwide.

That's not a lot.

Remember the flu kills about that many each year anyway. 

And the common cold causes about half that. 

Also remember, most of the world is unhealthy, overweight, obese and cancerous (lack of better term).

If you're healthy, below 40, and you haven't got underlying predisposition, you're pretty much as likely to die from covid as you are to die in a train crash.

Can you look up terrain theory, it's a theory that explains disease in terms of the host's health, not the diseases morbidity.

1 million people is not a lot? Also, according to WHO, there is an estimated 290 000-650 000 influenza related deaths worldwide. So basically half of the number that I produced, or less than a quarter of the official number. 

>If you're healthy, below 40, and you haven't got underlying predisposition, you're pretty much as likely to die from covid as you are to die in a train crash.

The main goal of the pandemic response was to reduce hospitalizations so that people don't have to die. The main reason that people died from COVID is because they weren't able to get access to the proper treatment that they needed (mainly ICU capacity).",m8ahhp,2021-03-21 19:56:11

I have looked at the CDC website and they have a bunch of stuff on MMR and thimerosal, but all I can find on pertussis vaccine and autism is a 2011 institute of medicine review that says no legitimate studies have been done on this [https://www.nap.edu/read/13164/chapter/12](https://www.nap.edu/read/13164/chapter/12)",m7f5vt,2021-03-18 18:17:23

"I've been following the entire story about some countries actually suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca vaccine and I'm concerned yes but I'm also a bit on the fence because more investigation are needed to be done to determine whether the blood clots are actually cause by the vaccine itself or something unrelated to the vaccines. The reason why I ask is that based on the article provided those are just report and are yet to be confirmed by any major health agency so I'll rather wait until a full investigation is done to determined if they're any links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the formation of blood clots.

However, while a country have EVERY right to suspend vaccination rollouts due to concerns (as what they did in the UK due to the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine before resuming), I can't stop but be extremely disappointed by the response the government takes regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine as those would only contribute to vaccine alarmism as well as empowered and embolden the anti-vaxx community to cast doubt on not only the AstraZeneca vaccine but all COVID-19 vaccines reducing confidence in them even more which as a pro-vaxx is what worried me to the core.

The potential effects it might have had on people that have used it, and the liklihood of any negatives happening.

Meanwhile, an out right antivaxer will completely deny the validity of a vaccine, and sometimes even claim the science that is behind the manufacturing one are absolite bunk, and have no way of backing up the screaming that they keep doing to the sky about it.

There are some people that will even try to dodge the antivaxer label by claiming they are, ""skeptical"" or try to place themselves amongst the unsure that are doing their homework, only to present the usual flimsy evidences expected of an antivaxer when they let the mask slip even a little bit.

If anyone that was, ""antivax"" would drop their guard for even a few minutes and actually pay attention to the sciences and explanations and stop listening to the Facebook Moms, Conspiracy Theorists, and self proclaimed ""experts"" that don't even have proper credentials or sources to back up their, ""studies"" then they would quickly stop being antivax as they'd realize just how ridiculous they've been.

fair enough.,m5drs1,2021-03-19 04:01:10
"First of all, you make a great point regarding scientific fact and scientific consensus. Solid points for that. 

I am a scientist, but not an immunologist, so I am far from an expert on this, however I will point out this important bit of information that’s missing from your discussions: the effectiveness of a vaccine does depend on the number of people vaccinated. 

Consider that the public had a lot more trust, in general, in scientists and doctors 50+ years ago, so when the recommendations were to vaccinate, people did. Most of the population did. As a result we basically eradicated diseases such as measles or polio. Today however there’s a lot more scepticism about science, doctors etc, so a lot more of the population is choosing not to get vaccinated, and we are seeing a lot of diseases such as measles starting to return. 

So finally, the reason that a lot of governments are taking drastic steps such as not allowing unvaccinated kids access to public schools is because your choice does not only affect you, but others as well. It’s like choosing to drink then drive home. If you hit a tree and kill yourself as a consequence of your choice, so be it. But if instead of a tree you hit another car, well your choice to drink and drive could have serious consequences to others. Keep questioning the science. Keep challenging the norms. That’s how progress is made. And always consider the credibility of the source of your information.",m5drs1,2021-03-18 01:55:40
"I can't speak for the poster of whom you ask this important question. But by refusing vaccine, folks  demonstrate a level of selfishness and lack of empathy that is not how we as a people have traditionally treated our fellow citizens.",m5drs1,2021-03-26 00:05:42
"Yeah, well for one it’s not FDA approved. It’s only being distributed on a conditional emergency basis. Scientists have been working on the vaccine for over 20 years and they’ve been pushing for it to be approved for years but has never been approved because it’s proven not to be safe or effective. Also, it does not keep you from spreading the virus to others or contribute to any herd immunity. Many people are getting the vaccination for convenience because they want to get back to “normal life” but the vaccine is only addressing one strain of the virus so those vaccinated can still contract the other strains that are circulating and other strains that have yet to be developed. 

I have multiple reasons against both popular vaccines. The Johnson and Johnson injects a spike protein (COVID mimic) that permanently binds to the surface of your cells. Your body can actually create antibodies to this protein and render the vaccination useless. Additionally, the protein could begin to attack healthy cells in your body similar to an autoimmune disease. Another reason I am against this vaccine is because it relies on harvesting cells from aborted fetuses. This is just a personal non-scientific conflict of mine. 

The mederna vaccine, on the other hand, is a different story. This is vaccine works by injecting unstable (must be kept at VERY low temps to be effective but then is injected into a warm human body?) genetic material that travels to the ribosomes of the cells and codes for the spike protein (same protein as Johnson and Johnson). The problem that I have with this is that the efficacy of the vaccine relies on the process of translation and protein synthesis. If the mRNA injected is unstable, it could lead to the body creating a faulty protein and who knows what effects this could have on our bodies. You can also never turn of the production of this protein because the mRNA never goes away (Trojan horse method). It can weaken our responses to new strains of Covid. Also, the unstable mRNA is encased in PEG (polyethylene glycol) and another lipid casing around the entire entity. These three things have never been tested together in humans and have not been proven to be safe in the body. No toxicity tests have been conducted so we have no idea what they all could do in the body.


On a personal note, I have a scary suspicion about these vaccines because if you google something like “why not to take the vaccine” you will only find links on sites telling you why it’s safe and that you should take it. All the videos that I’ve watched about the negatives of the vaccines have been taken down by YouTube. People are being silenced while there are over 25,000 adverse effects of the vaccines and people are dying from the vaccine and we are STILL being pushed to take the vaccine. Doctors, the president, our employers are pushing us to take something that’s not been proven to work, not proven to be safe, and they’re silencing those that raise concerns about the vaccine. It’s pretty scary.",m5drs1,2021-03-18 21:03:39

"I used to be antivax and I have read a lot on the vaccine controversy, so I am familiar with antivaxers' typical beliefs",m5drs1,2021-03-22 22:01:53
"How would you define an anti-vaxxer and why are they so bad in your eyes? I would have thought that someone who chooses to not get the vaccine would be considered an anti-vaxxer, but it sounds like you would disagree? I think you’d be fighting a losing battle there by recommending people stay home if they don’t want to get the vaccine, because those would be the last people to stay home as they feel there is nothing to fear",m5drs1,2021-03-15 08:04:38
"This is a great response, thank you. Would you be supportive of a mandated vaccine based on some of your reasoning above? Or would you say it justifies/explains the distaste people often show toward anti-vaxxers?",m5drs1,2021-03-18 04:25:57
"Great post. I would add that public schools have long required proof of vaccination as a condition of enrollment, as do private schools. One can request a religious exemption, but I don't know how that works. Maybe public schools in some places no longer require this, but I'm skeptical.

Every year, my kids private school would have a form for the family physician/pediatrician to complete and return. When I was a child, we had vaccination cards.",m5drs1,2021-03-24 23:40:34

"You ask some good questions. I don’t think governments impose mandates lightly, as a lot of people don’t like them. So to impose a mandate, I would think there would need to be a very clear need for it. There would need to be an overwhelming consensus, and the evidence would need to be significant. With most vaccines the evidence is significant, the scientific consensus is overwhelming. I would hope that we won’t need a mandate. What we need is a solution to address the copious amounts of disinformation on vaccines. Restore the trust. Just my opinion.",m5drs1,2021-03-18 13:42:36
"Agreeing to disagree is one of those rational, mature adult practices. But it's more than likely that as much as you are good with a live and let live attitude, the anti folks are reticent to explore ideas other than to those to which they are wedded. That's due to cultural (religious, far right, insular communities) which their preachers tell them what to think. 

I don't know how to converse with them because they are locked down and lock everyone out who holds the other view. They do not want the threat of a challenge to their belief systems.  Critical thinking skills are of the devil because questioning their authority figures is sin.                        

I wish I could offer useful advice. I've studied these folks for several years, and the walls are thick.",m5drs1,2021-03-26 02:05:24
"Well I don’t talk to many people about it because the only thing people see on the media or internet is that the vaccine is safe so people think I’m a conspiracy theorist when I question these things. I’ve talked to my family a little bit about it and they think I’m making it up or not as smart as their doctors so I steer away from the conversation lol. At least I tried.

There’s a doctor, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny who’s speaking out against the vaccine and when you google her name all that pops up is articles about vaccine safety. She’s being silenced and all of her videos have been routinely removed by YouTube. It’s pretty scary because she’s super smart and informed and no one can reach this information.",m5drs1,2021-03-19 04:23:31
My sources are the CDC and a PhD in biochemistry. It’s all scientific fact about how vaccines work in the body- it’s not my opinion. You could read papers on it that are public knowledge as well if you’re interested in the research. I’ve spent over 7 years studying this so I don’t think I could point you to just one source lol. My point of view may be different than yours and that’s okay but I think it’s a little kinder to be supportive and open to other views during this difficult time for everyone since many are so overwhelmed as it is. Be well!,m5drs1,2021-03-25 00:11:45

"That’s interesting - I understand what you’re saying about this type of person being unapproachable or unreasonable or unwilling to compromise or understand others’ world views, etc. but I’m pretty sure they think they same thing of other people also. My takeaway is that reasonable, honest people are a rarity these days, but when you do come across them, they tend to come from all walks of life. This makes it harder to paint groups with broad brush strokes",m5drs1,2021-03-26 02:09:29

I’m not against vaccines but now it’s different and they aren’t what they used to be. Feeling good from the vaxx is just a placebo , long term it damaged youre and changes and rewire youre actual DNA. It’s an operating system and you can even look up the interview with moderna confirming that it changes your DNA. You have to be sick or hate humanity and have severe issues with self love to actually not see what’s going on, not that I’m opposed to a purge but it’s a positive in the sense this vaccine will eradicate the intellectually disadvantaged lower echelon of the human gene pool, that’s a good thing humanity can’t go on like this forever as it starts with each of us when we look in mirror each day.",m2ju39,2021-03-18 11:21:21

This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders suchas autism and multiple sclerosis (Gallagher and Goodman, 2010; Stubgen, 2012). This study used the same vaccine and a similar time schedule to those used for human infant vaccination in China. Therefore, these findings suggest that there may be similar effects of neonatal HBV vaccination on brain development and behavior in humans.""**

This is a 2018 study on the subject:

**“These findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.” IL-4 mediates the delayed neurobehavioral impairments induced by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination that involves the down-regulation of the IL-4 receptor in the hippocampus.""**

"This is an article with a lot of statistical analysis, which can be easily manipulated. For example, the number of children counted without vaccination (the n value) was roughly five times higher in table 2b compared to the vaccinated children despite the fact that 90 percent of children in the U.s. were vaccinated in the U.s. not to mention, no real analytics are explained thoroughly in the methods section besides we used this software to do that.

Further more, the percentage of autism cases for each group in the provided table was 0.7 percent compared to 0.35 percent of children, which sure, is twice as likely, except given the sample size when compared to a larger population is statistically irrelevant ( that is, not important, but simply isn't properly representative of the larger population.) 

Now, going back to the first article, I did read in context of the thread. You claimed that he was wrong, autism was not caused by genetics. Yet the article doesn't outright say that. It says that environmental factors should be taken into consideration. Ironically, the article also says no ethnic groups were found to have any difference, yet the second article you gave claims that ""the black race has been shown to be associated with an increase risk of autism."" As well as a four fold increase in boys compared to girls. The two contradict each other.

Understandably, because transposons change, sometimes a different breed comes about which the vaccine wont work for. 

The corona virus has one spike protein. One. No change, vaccine will be effective just like for smallpox. 

Secondly, those incidents are caused by bad science or bad business practices, much like the infamous german pregnancy medication.

Brilliant scheme. Not to mention that he now has to deal with the backlash of backing a vaccine that ultimately failed putting his already established companies at risk. It's a good thing you don't work in the economics sector, because with ass-backwards logic like this, whatever you'd touch would surely fail spectacularly.

Yeah, there is a feedback loop in the medical sector between pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and insurance companies, but there is one large issue with your crazy ass conspiracy, and it is as I said before, if a vaccine doesn't work, there is backlash. A lot of backlash. If it was found out that the Pfizer vaccine didn't work and instead, made you sicker, which evidence suggests the opposite, that company would easily go under, and anyone found to be supporting them would be under fire. It's way too obvious to sustain. The reason insurance companies get away with it because their methods are subtle and not alot of people know how it works. 

Finally, changing your DNA, what a joke. You clearly have no actual understanding of how a vaccine works, captain of the tinfoil hat squad. The vaccine is and mRNA based vaccine. It's not even capable of recombination with DNA because of the way basic cell machinery works. It has to reverse transcriptase, so it can turn into DNA, therefore, that little comment makes you look like the biggest dumbass to roam the internet.

"You said and I quote, ‘what makes you think we have the capability to alter genes’, that implies that we don’t have the ability to alter genes yet, as a matter of fact we do now have the ability to alter genes. Where do you think this mRNA technology has come from, its from all the recent scientific breakthroughs. I’m not saying this experimental gene therapy treatment is going to permanently alter your genes, but it is certainly not a vaccine as we have known vaccines throughout history. So for anyone to force upon me some new technology that was developed in a matter of months and expect me to happily take it while it is still officially under a clinical trial is, to me, insane. I have taken every vaccine there is to take and have vaccinated my Son with all the vaccines prescribed for his age, so I am definitely not an anti-vaxxer or whatever term people are using these days. Once the clinical trial is finished, which is expected by the end of 2023 (pfizer November and Moderna December 2023), and it has been deemed safe, I will consider taking it.",m11f2n,2021-03-09 14:27:10

"That's the amazing thing about mRNA vaccines: instead of having to cultivate either an attenuated version of a virus, or a unique protein strand that our bodies can recognize, mRNA vaccines allow our own bodies to produce the protein spikes unique to a particular virus. It cuts out 90% of the work. 

Its kind of like instead of ordering something off of Amazon and them delivering an entire product, instead they email you the instructions and you 3D print it at home. That's why they were able to create the vaccine so quickly. That's all mRNA is, a messenger. Nothing in your body is changing.

Many children with TSC have autism. The boy had been diagnosed with autism before ever being vaccinated.

If you where afraid that the MMR and another vaccine caused autism that has been proven false in multiple studies world wide.

As for the mRNA vaccine there is no virus in it. It is a set of instructions given to your sells to produce the antigen protein found on the wall of the virus. Your body sees this and says hey you don’t belong. Your immune system kicks into full gear and starts producing antibodies. As for the fever and sickness you feel that’s the other part of your immune system just going to work trying to kill the antigens with heat. (The antigen is not a virus) but so if the virus enters your system some of your cells will recognize it tell your immune system hey produce these antibodies and start fighting.

If you skeptical about ingredients let’s say there’s mercury which there isn’t anymore, but those compound into different chemicals. Are you confused about what an mRNA vaccine is? Are you confused on why we have to create a new vaccine when a virus mutates? Do you think someone’s going to put a micro chip into your blood stream?

And in fact, I've had my point proven by multiple doctors - literally being told ""don't question these things, this is what's best for you"". And that in itself raises a red flag. Especially when I reject a handful of vaccines for my kids and say ""Okay, well do these 2 today and thats it"" and thr doctor walks in and says ""Okay, so we're gonna do these 5 today and the rest later"". And when I say ""No, I said only these 2"", they try to debate me more until I push them to finally saying ""okay, let me go get a a new shot contains those.

It is good that you've found a few good doctors you can turn to though, keep those good ones in your life. The good doctors genuinely do go into their field to improve other peoples lives as well as advance the science they practice.

It's also good that you found nutritionists that have diet and health plans that seem to work for you. However... your nutritionists aren't doctors. At least not medical doctors. Not in the sense that one would expext a medical doctor to be like. Your nutritionists know what they're talking about when it comes to balancing your diet and likely know good exercise regimes that can and likely will help. 

But when it comes to something like a disease, especially one with potential lethality like the one people are taking Pfizer for, they know about as much as any laymen out there. They know as much as you or me might know. If they're antivax like you say, then they likely know even less then you or me and will even toss any truthful statements about vaccines right out the window. Don't outright drop them if their health plans are working for you. But take anything they might say regarding vaccines with a grain of salt, if not ignore those statements out right.

If you're truly unsure about the vaccines, consult your actual doctors about them. They're the ones that actually study the fields vaccines come from, so even if they might not be a specialist in it, that fact alone already makes them more qualified to talk about it by an extremely wide margin.",m0w8fi,2021-03-09 06:52:00

 Lets get specific here. Has he spent 10 years studying and understanding mRNA vaccines? As far as I'm aware, its as brand new to him as it is to anyone else.

At any rate, I'm done defending someones elses point. You really want to be, ""the right one"" with your train of logic? Why don't you go google the new vaccine yourself.

"Hey op, just a heads up. While I appreciate the sentiment, if you really want to make a difference and encourage antivax to make the right decision, then name calling or belittling isn't really the play (in fact it's going to cause much more harm than good). 

In my experience, most of the antivax community aren't ""Karen's"" as often portrayed or even intellectually lacking, they're vulnerable people who have been misinformed and taken advantage of. Making fun of them, calling them names, insulting their intelligence, etc. just alienates them further making them less likely to listen to reason. 

I'd instead reccomend becoming informed on the common antivax talking points, keep a handful of well researched sources and know where/how to find more reliable information. And finally approach and start a conversation with compassion and a level head. Let them air their concerns and address them calmly and one at a time. Think of yourself as convincing someone you love to leave a cult (which it very much is), it won't work for everyone, and it usually won't work the first time, but you're at least providing an open pathway to reason and understanding. 

Definitely not saying any of this is easy, having a loved one become antivax is painful and disappointing. It's not dissimilar to trying to address a loved ones alcoholism or addiction issues. But saying things like ""fuck with anti vaxx retards"" is only going to further alienate people who might have been willing to listen in other circumstances :)",lzl9zr,2021-03-09 15:54:59

"Dear Sub-Human Filth,

I'm appealing to all of you stupid idiots to vote Democrat in 2024. That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist rednecks can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family.

We Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible.

I don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms.

The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you.

You see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you.

It's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do.

All of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than I am.

So please vote Democrat. Help me help you, you worthless motherfuckers.",lxu51v,2021-04-03 16:08:56

"I would make an argument the following:

This is a first of its kind vaccine, using mrna, and under Operation Warpeed the creation was able to bypass and streamline some of the same standards a traditional vaccine goes through. So being there is not significant data showing what, if any, long-term effects might exist. 

With the inability to determine if the potential short and long-term side effects of the vaccine outweigh the short and long-term risks of  COVID. The vaccine should be avoided until more data is available to make an informed decision.",lxnj4q,2021-03-04 19:07:12

We also have to do a speech and they told us we have to pick one side,lxnj4q,2021-03-06 23:01:42
"Do you have any sources that can back up these ideas, I'm not trying to say that your wrong as you do make a very good point but I would need to be able to physically cite an article to use it.",lxnj4q,2021-03-04 19:10:27
"That’s where I don’t have a specific source for that, but you can certainly piece it together by using sources that show what a vaccine normally goes through, how this is a first of its kind vaccine that is used for humans, the VAERS database showing reported side effects so far (there is a ton of data available here for all sorts of info), and then just information on COVID itself with the short and long term side effects that have been documented.

"I have a similar problem with my family. What worked for me was sitting down with them (if possible) in person and talk calmy to them. Asking them why they think that way. Explaining how it really is. 
My family always starts to get aggressive if I don't agree with them so I always had to tell them to calm down. Always said ""If you want to convince me this is true why are you screaming at me instead of talking like adults"" 

If that does not work.. harsh reality. What actually happens when people don't vaccinate. How bad that could look like. Asking them to ask every doctor they can find. Pictures articles.. etc

"Well. Sitting down and talking would be really a good first step.   
A thing that is always really helpfull is asking your local doctor for advice if you need any information or at least some arguments for that conversation. One thing I noticed from your descriptions is that your aunt is scared for your cousins health..  
In that case I would suggest to start from the very bottom of the problem, asking why they think it's that dangerous, what their concerns are etc. Like digging into the root of the problem. Maybe asking as well why they could be so sure of the fact that vaccines hurt people. I can assure you, most of the time it's literally the fear of the unknown, people don't understand how vaccines work, that why they are scared and believe it could harm them (tbh I don't blame them, I would be sceptical too if I would not do my research)   
All it takes are some good arguments and valid research, convincing somebody is not easy.. I really hope you can convince your family to change their mind so for their own health.

"Ok I was typing up a top tier roast but I think I'll try to be helpful instead. Your claims about mercury. Mercury has not been in most vaccines for the past couple of decades with the exception of vaccines that use Thimerosal as a preservative. 

According to the CDC, Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a naturally occurring ionic compound that is cleared from the human body much faster than methylmercury, the kind that likes to stuck around and build up in your body. If you've eaten tuna before, you've put yourself at a higher risk to the dangers of mercury than you would with a vaccine, which again, not all of include Thimerosal. 

With formaldehyde, the concentration is so small to the point of it not even affecting a human body. You can call it a poison or a toxin or whatever, but in reality, all compounds on the planet is considered a ""poison"" if inserted into the body in sufficient enough quantities. Hell, even water poisoning exists. You're gonna stop drinking water now because too much of it can kill you? No, of course not. Formaldehyde is naturally occurring in your body at a small concentration already, and vaccines that contain a microscopic amount of it won't do anything to your health.

This was from ten minutes of googling and just the very fact that I obtained this data do quickly is a testament to how willfully ignorant antivaxxers choose to be. There's a whole world of information out there and yet these people choose not to take advantage of it. The internet is a waste when only used for the echo chambers of facebook mom groups.",lvexmi,2021-03-01 19:37:54
Also antivax: passing this snake oil and crystals will surely help against the disease than some state of the art medicine,lvexmi,2021-03-01 22:07:47
"Yeah, antivax logic which basically translates to sheer bullshit.

The use of mercury compounds was discontinued decades ago. Almost no vaccines use thimerosal (which contains trace amounts) and no COVID vaccine contains thimerosal. If you're worried about mercury exposure, stay away from seafood as the exposure levels are higher than any vaccine ever was.

As for formaldehyde, it is used to deactivate viruses in the manufacturing process. Some vaccines may contain trace amounts but far too small to have any effect. Again, if you're worried about formaldehyde exposure then avoid fruits like bananas. A single banana contains more formaldehyde than a lifetimes worth of vaccines.

Basically if you don't want to be exposed to any harmful compound, even in such tiny amounts as to be unnoticeable, then don't eat, don't drink and don't breathe. I'm not sure what you can do to avoid skin exposure but if you stop breathing then skin exposure won't be a problem for very long.",lvexmi,2021-03-02 02:01:39

Add in crazy misinformation spread by anti vaxxers and it's no wonder so many new moms are afraid. We shouldn't look down on them. We should educate them.

"I was mocking my own country... The way we are taught in school always felt like we were trying to portray us as the greatest nation (which I believe as not true). What really got me thinking about that was because of the history books... Example: we did not go into WWII until the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor (partial truth for us to officially start fighting), what books don't really tell you was that we were supplying guns and such to allied nations during the war but acted like we wanted nothing to do with the war... Until Pearl Harbor. Granted history books might of changed details from when I was in school last since its been almost 10 years now, so I would not know.

Also it is interesting that most people call the 24h format as military time I think because of commands like: meet here at o three hundred (0300) or at thirteen hundred hours (1300). I am proud of myself for at least learning how to read the 24h format.",ltit1w,2021-03-02 18:08:12
"I wouldn't know, epidemiology is an expertise I do not have, from what I've heard was by word of mouth and this I did not say it was definite. It seems many are in turmoil because of the new strain already here with a mutation... I speculate that it MIGHT (not saying it will) be like the flu and mutate every year; looking back 10p years ago with the Spanish flu, not as bad as this highly potent COVID virus. 

I am planning on getting the vaccine due to being high risk because of asthma and if what you state is true for the vaccine helping protect against the serious illness portion of it, then I could have a better chance as to not develope as bad of symptoms. I've had acute upper respiratory illness before but covid might end up making it look like allergies in comparison... I don't know. 

Another note: I know someone that contracted the virus early last year and they recovered in may but developed pneumonia afterwards and was SSUUCCHH a slow process to recover from it. I also had 2 family members catch it (and recovered) both would be considered elderly and recovered from it to the best of my knowledge with not as serious in symptoms as my friend; but could or could not be based on lifestyle of almost organic as possible and/or just down to genetics.

"There’s quite a bit wrong with this matey.

Vaccines take 10 years to develop - no they don’t, a lot of the 10 years is wasted time between parts of research and trials where they go fundraising for more money to be able to fund the next step. Plow money at it, then they can just continually run through all the steps.

Fast tracked - it depends what you mean by fast tracked, they still have to meet all the same necessary safety standards to be able to be used. The simplest way to explain this is it takes 1 man 1,000 hours to copy a book, but it takes 1,000 men 1 hour to do the same task. Following from the previous part if you throw unprecedented money at something they can put a lot of man power resources at something, this goes both for the R&D and also the regulatory bodies. Secondly from the UK’s MHRA authorising vaccines faster, that’s because they was collecting data from the trails long before the trials was finished. They didn’t wait for the entire trial to be completed before receiving any documents, they actively got data from the trials while they was ongoing to get ahead, so that once the trial was finish they was already x% of the way through checking the data.

Covidvaccine subreddit - yeah I’m not going to pay any attention to those, it’ll just be like [Wobble Girl](https://youtu.be/Kpe1u4cKbTk)

33 deaths Norway - you mean the really old frail people who received the vaccine in the first wave? The ones who was also probably on deaths door for something else too? In the UK we’re up to 19 million doses given, we’ve not seen dramatic deaths or serious injuries/ health issues. There was an issue with allergies but that was looked into and found a very small percentage of people had allergies to one or more of the vaccine component in the Pfizer vaccine, so to resolve they’ll get the Astra Zeneca vaccine instead.",lsxrwq,2021-02-27 09:39:40

"In regards to constitution I can’t comment, I’m from the UK not the USA, we’ve had just as bad time with the amount of deaths. I would however say that our restrictions are stricter that yours (from appearance on media) and now our deaths are falling rapidly.

Coronavirus is a serious threat though. At present USA has had 500,000 deaths and the UK has had 120,000 deaths. Both numbers are severely high in comparison to other countries who took restrictions more seriously. The virus is mutating and becoming more contagious, the Kent variation for starters has become the dominant strain in the UK, I’m also sure it’s been found in the USA. That strain is what caused the UK’s more lax restrictions to stop being effective during the Christmas period, leading to our new year lockdown which we’re in now.

The people who suffer from serious illness or death is much higher than the small percentage you’ve just given, even false antivax figures give it more validity than that.

Healthy lifestyle isn’t a protection from the virus, you can’t vitamin C your way to immunity. Obesity is definitely a factor in regards to how severe the illness can be, but thinking that if you live healthier you’ll be fine is severely lacking knowledge of what’s happening.",lsxrwq,2021-02-27 13:51:06

"It’s not cognitive dissonance, it’s just facts.

You probably won’t like this [sauce](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/norway-deaths-coronavirus-vaccine) but I feel their write up covers a lot of bases.

There was only 23 initial deaths, of which they happened within 6 days of injection, not the same day like purported, 10 additional deaths where then linked at a later date. They was all over the age of 75. It was early January not a few days to a week ago, and has not increased in scale despite there being an increased amount of doses given, the UK alone has administered 19 million doses but we haven’t seen an increasing amount of complications leading to death. All deaths linked was with patients with severe underlying health conditions prior to the vaccination and I haven’t seen any proof of them living in the same care home, only that they are in the same country.

So all in all, coincidence does not mean there’s something sinister going on.

I do appreciate your edit comment and I hope you and your family have no health issues either whether you choose to take the vaccine or not at a later date. I do however hope that you keep an open mind which could lead you to change your opinion regarding the vaccination with the increased information and testing data coming available over time. I personally believe the covid vaccines currently available and soon to be available (once authorised) are safe and that any possible reactions are still better than the alternative of contracting the virus or allowing the virus to circulate until it mutates into something more severe.",lsxrwq,2021-02-27 13:37:42

"Well I’m glad that you aren’t fully antivax. It shows that at the very least your issues are only with these current vaccines, not vaccines in general.

But I’d still like to state that only 2 of the 3 main in use vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna but not Astra Zeneca) are mRNA vaccines. I’m not sure about others like Johnson/ Jenson etc but they haven’t yet been authorised in my country so I haven’t looked into them yet.

I’m not so sure about the agenda. I do believe there’s people taking advantage of the situation such as Jeff Bezos, but that doesn’t mean people are necessarily behind it or manipulating things for the vaccines, just rather they’ve seen opportunities to make more money and are, but that doesn’t mean all are. Astra Zeneca for instance have said that their vaccine is not for profit until the pandemic is over. So for now all vaccine prices cover manufacturing costs but that’s it. The UK government funded a lot of their research so they’ve not lost money really, but they’ll increase prices once we’re on top of the virus as they envisage a need for yearly vaccinations in the future possibly. But it’s expected it’ll take a few years to vaccinate the world when considering only a very small percentage of countries have vaccines up to yet.

On the queen + duke thing. It was quite surprising that the queen did say something for the media, but she has done similar things in the past such as speaking out about Scottish independence, which at the time was seen as controversial but possibly attributed to Scotland voting to stay in the UK. She’s a very patriotic person and lives her life for duty, which in itself has led to family rifts such as Prince Harry.

The duke bit, I’ve never actually heard that, but I’d ask what was the context of the conversation? A sentence can mean many different things depending what was before or after it. Although the quoted sentence can be taken in the way you mean I’d need to read or hear more of the conversation before I’d make judgment on it.",lsxrwq,2021-02-27 14:38:54

I haven’t met anyone with the horror stories that are used to scare us in to vaccinating our kids. In other words, don’t believe everything you are told. Do your own research.

I am significantly less healthy than the average child, and have a lot of issues that could be solved with vaccines/medication. Due to vaccines, we have been able to almost completely eradicate polio and measles, with almost two generations not having any experiences with it. While I do get that it may be skeptical with the new covid vaccine, having it gone through very fast testing, due to the amount of people that have died because of selfish people who have not thought about others and have gone partying, and been in places without care for the people who are high risk, we have the amount of deaths we do now. A vaccine may be the only shot we have at reducing the amount of deaths that will happen in the future, because we have seen that restrictions don’t help when they people don’t care for them.",lteh3u,2021-03-01 02:16:44

It's so strange that anyone would believe this. Your schools must not teach history on the topic?

"I think this article from Scientific American shows that antivax is causing a reemergence of previously diminished or eradicated diseases. [Rethinking Herd Immunity ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rethinking-herd-immunity/). It’s like when you see a car stuck on the tracks and the train is coming. We know not to many kids are dying currently. But as less and less people vaccinate there will be a horrible crash; and there’s going to be a lot of dead kids .

That’s why vaccinating is so important and hearing people give the long debunked argument is frustrating. It’s also like a lot of the people who use that argument are willfully ignoring the all the neon signs saying keep doing this and there will be dead children.",lrvzbt,2021-02-25 07:09:11
"As others have pointed out here, the reason disability or death from not being vaccinated is still rare is because a good chunk of the population has for sometime been vaccinated. If vaccination levels fall off the back of antivaxxer nonsense, then expect that to change. 

I’m old enough to remember a time when you’d see kids in class with leg braces - one of the better outcomes of childhood polio. You don’t see that anymore, because vaccines. Vaccines have been ridiculously successful and people have become complacent. If people delay or stop vaccinating because of this complacency, there will be more deaths from vaccine preventable diseases.",lrvzbt,2021-02-27 22:05:52
"**TL;DR Vaccines do reduce childhood death, but even with pre-vaccine disease rates less than 2%, and probably way less, of children would die form vaccine preventable diseses**

**This is not an argument against vaccines, but an argument against the myth that most children would die in a wold without vaccines, vaccines are still important though**

I know that vaccines did greatly reduce the prevalence of many infections diseases which killed children

I actually used to be antivax (grew up that way), but then I did my own research and found that vaccines are actually good in many cases, In the process of this research I have looked at the CDC statistics on all the diseases that vaccines prevent (stats for before and after vaccination) and am quite well aware that vaccines reduce childhood death, however I cannot think of any disease that is so dangerous it would make childhood death a normal thing if vaccinations were stopped

Chickenpox kills 1 in 100,000 infected children [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#clinical-features](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#clinical-features)

Tetanus is very dangerous if you get it, but before the vaccine it only infected 500-600 people per year [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html#secular](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html#secular)

Serious complications of rubella in children are one in thousands [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rubella.html#clinical-features](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rubella.html#clinical-features) (pregnancy is a different story though)

Rotavirus caused 23-60 deaths a year before the vaccine [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#us](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#us)

Polio killed around 1 in 100,000 people a year before vaccination [https://ourworldindata.org/polio](https://ourworldindata.org/polio), in a population of 2-3 hundred million, this means that a few thousand people died each year

Pneumococcal killed around 200 children each year before vaccination [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pneumo.html#secular-trends](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pneumo.html#secular-trends)

Pertussis infected 175,000 people per year before the vaccine [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pert.html#secular-trends-in-US](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pert.html#secular-trends-in-US), and in the most at risk age group the case fatality rate is 0.5%, meaning that even if all infected people were under 6 months this would have been around 875 deaths per year

Death from mumps, even among infected unvaccinated persons, is ""very rare"" [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#clinical-features](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#clinical-features)

Before vaccination, meningococcal infected about 2-3 thousand people each year [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html#secular](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html#secular), and has a case fatality rate of 10-15 percent, [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html#features](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html#features), so if we take the high end and say 3,000 cases and 15 % CFR we get 450 deaths a year

Measles killed 500 people a year before vaccination [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#secular](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#secular)

The flu does not typically kill children, and until recently flu shots were not recommended for most children, but I cannot find exact numbers off the top of my head, I can look more tomorrow

HPV does not kill children

Children are not the main age group that gets Hepatitis B, but I don't have a source for exact numbers right now, I do know that childhood death was not common in the 80s before the hep b vaccine was invented

Hepatitis A infected around 3,000 people per year before vaccination [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hepa.html#trends](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hepa.html#trends), and has a case fatality rate of 0.3% [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hepa.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hepa.html#complications), meaning that there were around 9 deaths a year

Hib infected around 20,000 people a year before the vaccine [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hib.html#secular-trends](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hib.html#secular-trends), and had a case fatality rate of 3-6 percent [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hib.html#clinical-features](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hib.html#clinical-features), if we take the high end of 6% that means 1,200 deaths each year

Diphtheria killed 13-15K each year before the vaccine, but that was also before antibiotics [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html#secular](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html#secular)

Now if we take the high end of all these death numbers for each disease, we have

600 tetanus

60 rotavirus 

3,000 polio 

200 pnumococcal 

875 pertussis

450 meningococcal

500 measles

9 hepatitis A

1,200 hib

15,000 diptheria

And add them all up we get 25,944 deaths, this is excluding diseases that are rarely fatal for children: mumps, rubella, flu, chickenpox and HPV, and excluding hepatitis B because I don't know a source off the top of my head for that, but I do know that it is not a common killer of children

Now to determine the death risk we would need to compare the number of deaths to the population by looking at what the population (or birth rate) was in the time that each number was from, or to err on the high side (higher death risk estimate) we can use a low birth rate of 2 million, as the birthrate was greater than that for the entire 20th century

And lets just round up to 30K deaths since I left out hep b and would rather overestimate the risk of death, although I really doubt it killed 5,000 kids a year

if the birth rate is 2 million a year and the vaccine preventable death rate is 30K a year, then the probability that any given person will ever die of vaccine preventable disease is 1 in 67, now this almost certainly higher than the real childhood death rate we would have without vaccines, as I rounded everything up, added over 4,000 deaths to account for hepatitis b and the rarely fatal diseases, counted all tetanus cases as deaths, used diphtheria numbers from before antibiotics, assumed in many cases that all deaths are in children, and used a purposely too low birth rate

I know this got really long and complicated, if you are confused about any of the numbers please let me know

Also this was not the most detailed analysis as it is 3AM here and I want to go to sleep, so I just did a rough estimate that was intended to be an overestimate",lrvzbt,2021-03-01 08:50:06
"I know that there will be death if too many people stop vaccinating, my point is that ""autism is not a problem"" is not a good argument for vaccines, not that vaccines are unimportant",lrvzbt,2021-02-25 07:38:07
"I agree that there will be more deaths if less people vaccinate, but even with no one vaccinated childhood death from vaccine preventable diseases will be uncommon event

I'm not arguing against vaccination, I'm arguing against the people who say that if you don't vaccinate for fear or autism you must prefer death to autism",lrvzbt,2021-02-27 22:14:14
"I think it’s not that autism is not a problem, but rather we see people try and use an outdated and quite frankly an ablest argument. Vaccines don’t cause autism, but not vaccinating will cause death. So the natural conclusion is, if they really that vaccines cause autism, that these people choose death over autism. So when we say “autism is better than death” we aren’t saying autism isn’t a problem. We are saying even if vaccines cause autism, autism is preferable to dead kids.",lrvzbt,2021-02-25 14:41:56
"“...but even with no one vaccinated childhood death from vaccine preventable diseases will be uncommon event”

What makes you think they will be uncommon Put it this way, they will be common enough that you’ll personally know people who were maimed or killed by such diseases - as was the case in the past. As is the case now with COVID-19. 

“I'm arguing against the people who say that if you don't vaccinate for fear or autism you must prefer death to autism”

I think it’s a rhetorical response to the thoroughly debunked claim that vaccines cause autism and that autism is somehow infinitely worse than risking your child’s health with a vaccine preventable illness.",lrvzbt,2021-02-27 22:54:16
"I don't think many people would dispute that death is worse than autism, however childhood death is rare in developed countries (where antivaxers are) even among the unvaccinated, and antivaxers believe the the risk of death from not being vaccinated is near zero, most of them are not looking at it as a choice between death and autism",lrvzbt,2021-02-25 19:32:14
">What makes you think they will be uncommon

The CDC pinkbook has pages on each disease that there are vaccines for in the US, and each page has a section called ""Secular Trends in the United States"" where they talk about the rate of disease before and after vaccination, reading these shows that the number of deaths is small relative to the number of births, indicating that death was uncommon even before vaccination, even if you add them all up most kids would be fine even without vaccines

I am aware that vaccines prevent death, and I support vaccination, I'm trying to point out that the people who say ""your kid will probably die if everyone was not vaccinated"" do not know what they are talking about

>you’ll personally know people who were maimed or killed by such  diseases - as was the case in the past. As is the case now with  COVID-19.

The only person I know who was seriously affected by covid was someone who I was sadly so old and frail that I had come to accept the fact that they were going to die soon even before I knew there would be a disease outbreak

>claim that.... autism is somehow infinitely worse than risking your child’s health with a vaccine preventable illness.

My point is that most antivaxers don't really claim this, so it is a strawman, and yes I see this argument used seriously",lrvzbt,2021-02-28 00:34:27

"Vaccines are not “full of babies”.  Fetal cells were harvested from elective abortions during the 70’s and 80’s.  The cells have been cultivated and grown in laboratory environments.  The “fetal lines” used today are several thousand generations old from the original samples harvested in the 70/80’s.  

The cells are used in the testing of vaccines, and in some vaccines, used as part of the vaccine cultivation/manufacture process.   This is ethically problematic for some who view abortion as murder, as they consider it as using cells from a murdered child to make vaccines.  Individuals who are educated and hold the belief that this is medically ethically wrong may choose to avoid vaccines or any treatments that are associated with these cultivated fetal lines. 

Individuals who are uneducated, or have zero understanding about test tubes and Petri dish science hear “fetal lines” and translate that into “fetal material” ... or “full of dead babies”.

Formaldehyde is used in vaccine manufacturing.   After manufacturing is complete there may be residual amounts left that are measurable.  However the human body generates more formaldehyde naturally than what’s in the vaccine.  So there is no measurable change in the body’s formaldehyde levels until after embalming. 

So when someone says it’s “full of formaldehyde and babies”, this person’s science expertise peaked in junior high Physical Science.  I wouldn’t trust this person to mix chemicals in a swimming pool, or even swim without adult supervision.",lqskto,2021-02-24 01:17:30

"TL;DR at the end

Most people who eat a varied diet, with fruits, vegetables, healthy grains, stuff that's scientifically proven to be good for you already has vitamins in it naturally, like vitamin C, found in strawberries, citrus, and other fruits and veggies. Some people OD on this stuff but it doesn't really do anything. 

Vitamin C, for example, if eaten in excess, is excreted through your urinary system. (Therefore, doesn't work) It's important to indicate that not all vitamins eaten in excess just pass through your body though, some can lead to death. For example, vitamin A, if consumed in sufficient quantities, can actually kill you. You're probably getting enough vitamins in your life if you're eating like a normal human. Just don't be a basement dweller who eats Big Macs without the lettuce with a side of chicky nuggies.

That being said, vitamins do work if you're not getting any of them through your food. If your diet really is that shitty and you're not getting the vitamins you need naturally, or you have a deficiency then yeah, go ham on vitamins. I usually have an apple a day alongside a good amount of veggies in my normal meals, so I don't worry about vitamins too much. However, on days when my diet is pretty bad I will pop a vitamin C tablet, but that's about it. 

Additionally, know that one vitamin C tablet is enough. One tablet usually contains the upper maximum a human being can absorb in a single sitting, around 2000 mg. My mom will occasionally consume 2-4 in a single sitting thinking it'll boost her immune system. I've tried to convince her otherwise but she's not convinced. Don't be like her. 

I don't have any sources backing this stuff up, but from what I know this is the scientific consensus. 

TL;DR Vitamins are only necessary if you have a crappy diet or if you have a deficiency. However, most people eating healthy diets get all the vitamins they need from their food. People who consume too many vitamins just have it passed through their body as waste, or, in some cases, can risk injury or death to themselves.",lpndib,2021-02-23 02:56:27

"**A Multidisciplinary Discussion Among Experts on Issues Surrounding COVID-19 Vaccines**

About this Event

IF THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHOULD!

Should me and my family get vaccinated? Is it safe? What happens if I don’t get vaccinated? Why am I not given priorities to vaccination? How do decisions made by the governments and big companies affect our vaccination access? 🤔

As the pandemic stretches on into the new phase where the vaccines have been developed, questions about **safety, distribution and ethics** are hotly debated. Relevant issues revolving around **equality, free will and geopolitics** also emerged. 🗣

In this multidisciplinary panel discussion, we invited experts from the fields of **philosophy, public health, public policy, medicine, bioethics, political economy and law** to discuss the **most in-demand questions revolving around the vaccines**, addressing your doubts and debunking falsehoods. ‼️

You will walk away with a more informed mind, and are able to make a more educated decision for yourself, your family and your country. 🧠💡

Join us on Saturday, March 6, where we bring together international experts from different industries to discuss on the issues surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines, just as they are being rolled out. 🔥

REGISTER HERE: [https://myphilsoc-vaccine.eventbrite.com/?aff=RedditCOVID19](https://myphilsoc-vaccine.eventbrite.com/?aff=RedditCOVID19)

Some **issues that will be discussed** include:

💉 What are your opinions on expedited trials and manufacturing processes of vaccines? Should people avoid vaccination due to its expedited manufacturing process?

💉 For people who reject vaccinations, what are the spectrum of reasons? Are they all anti-vaxxers?

💉 Is it ethical to pursue the natural herd immunity strategy?

💉 Judging by the current scenario in your country, do you think we should mandate vaccination?

**Expert Panelists** for this Event Are:

👤 [Dr. Khor Swee Kheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swee-kheng-khor-5777096/?originalSubdomain=my), consultant for the World Health Organisation (WHO)

"If you can't find an antivaxxers sub-reddit, could it be because there's no such a group of homogenous people who identify as antivaxxers?  I mean that concept was created by doomers and gloomers (and those who love to think they can control the world) to ridicule people who believe in their rights to do as they wish when it comes to putting things into their body. 

Here's an analogy: I sell plants. My plants provide plenty of benefits and values.  A lot of people love my plants and buy them, but some people don't have my plants for various reasons: 
- they don't have anywhere to put them, 
- don't like the look of them, 
- can't get to them, 
- prefer to decorate and landscape with other things, 
- some even hate my plants...

"Former antivaxer here, first off let me say that I do not believe avoiding vaccines is a well informed decision, I'm just trying to explain why people are antivax

First off while the risk of a dangerous infection is higher if not vaccinated, it is just not true that unvaccinated kids will most likely die, I've read through CDC statistics on diseases before and after vaccination (this is part of how I became pro vax) and I honestly don't have any idea what disease you think is so common and deadly that it will kill a large percentage of unvaccinated kids in first world countries (third world countries don't have antivaxers who fear autism)

Second, autism can cause severe problems, so it is logical that a parent would want to avoid autism, and if the think the probability of severe autism or other serious side effects of vaccination is higher than the probability of serious infection from not being vaccinated then they will be antivax

Let me know if you have any questions",lm6hx2,2021-02-17 22:40:49

You have no way to sue anyone if you have any adverse side effects or allergic reactions to any of the covid vaccines. The injectable flu vaccine is made with the dead virus. The nasal cannula spray is made with the live flu virus. No one flu vaccine is effective against all flu viruses as there are four “types” of flu viruses.

So yeah it’s kinda ableist to say that you’d rather have your child have a higher chance of catching a deadly disease, than them being neorodivergent.

This not a perfect analogy but polio does not harm most people it infects, yet some go on to be paralyzed, so it makes sense to try to prevent polio. I think of autism similarly, it makes sense that people would want to avoid autism because some, but not all, of those who have it are negatively affected

">Autism is **not**  problematic.  Obviously, Autistic is not the same as not being Autistic, but that's not the fault of Autistics.  That's society's fault for  being designed to cater to a select few

It's not anyone fault, it's just the way autism affects some people, and discrimination against those with autism a major problem as well, I'm not sure why you think I am denying that?

Both the direct effects of autism AND the the widespread discrimination in society can cause major problems for those with autism, and yes I am aware not everyone with autism is negatively affected by the direct effects of autism, but I have been, and there is nothing ableist about stating my personal experience as someone with autism, I have no idea why you think me staying that in my personal experience autism can be problematic contributes to oppression?

"You’re wrong about the aspirin thing. It’s used in low doses to strengthen  plants, and in high enough doses it stresses plants out and causes them to turn into hermaphrodites, which isn’t really desirable behavior unless you want seeds in your weed. 

Aspirin in regular doses is hepatoxic / bad for your liver, and in high doses of aspirin can easily kill humans too. so yeah, I’m saying that humans probably shouldn’t take regular or high doses of aspirin either if they don’t want to die. 

Do you know what happens to a healthy person who takes Nitroglycerin? Their Blood pressure drops, and they do fun things like lose consciousness!   It’s prescribed by doctors to counteract the effects of angina, not by hillbillies who have no idea wtf they’re talking about as a cure all poison, like some people are doing with colloidal silver.

 (Sorry, I've used aspirin on tomato plants and such but heard it could be used to feminize cannabis too, online.)

You can't say thing is bad because it's used in a way that isn't on people is my point.

I'm not saying silver or any of those examples should be taken lightly, or possibly unless prescribed.

What I'm saying is explaining our dismissing it the way you did is a bad way of feeding misinformation.

I don't like it being used either, but anti vaxxers do exactly what you did. You see this ingredient formaldehyde in this vaccine? It's used to embalm bodies!!!! 

Never mind that we make or own formaldehyde. But again, too much is a bad idea.

It's not the fact you're against silver being used this way, I don't think anyone but pharmacies should be able to sell it and that big warning labels should go on the box etc. 

But yeah, I want arguing you were wrong about silver or anything else, just the way you framed that argument wasn't helpful. Plants are not people.

"Im not sure what your problem is. I stand by my original statement. It changes the gender of plant seeds by essentially the same mechanisms that it fucks up the human body. 

Structurally, silver is very chemically similar to copper. Copper is needed / used by both plants and humans for certain biological processes, whereas Silver, is not. Due to the similarity of physical characteristics between silver and copper, when silver is introduced to either plants or humans, the silver will interact with some of the same proteins, enzymes etc. that plants or humans use for various biological processes, which will result in said processes not working as they should. 

I used the case of seeds becoming feminized, because it was the easiest / fastest thing I could type that would demonstrate that silver exposure seriously affects biological processes. 

It wasn’t a bad example, I just didn’t want to take the time to explain what you could have easily learned yourself.",lkprwz,2021-02-16 07:51:49

"Well, the first thing I noticed, is that the site uses data obtained from the Pew Research Center. On the surface, (much like Fox News), the Pew claims to exist for Non-Partisan reasons. 

But once we do a little digging, we find that Pew Research was founded by a family of wealthy conservatives, and is a think tank that has donated millions of dollars to the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which is a Conservative Think tank associated with Oil Companies, etc. 

That hardly qualifies them as being bipartisan, and therefore renders any of the data that their research produces invalid.

It's like non gmo food people. Or flat earthers. Literally every food is gmo. And we have known the earth isn't flat for hundreds of years.  Humans have been breeding food for thousands of years. And we have been using inoculation for a few hundred. There is nothing about avoiding vaccines that makes them look smart, but if they admit they were wrong, they look dumb. So they fight to the end. 

I worked at a furniture store, and telling someone they didn't get a good deal on the sofa/mattress that broke down in 3 years when they haggled for an hour and still overpaid is really bad, even if it's true (90% of the time it is) because they get upset. Because now they feel dumb. Luckily, they didn't brag all over social media and become a poster child for the cheap sofa movement, if they had, they would be furious rather than disbelieving, then upset. They would fight that battle with every breath.

(As an aside, this isn't to be defeatist, we should always obliterate anti-vaxx agit-prop with pro-vaxx agit-prop, but we should be realistic with our goals and targets.)

It's a factor of why arguments devolve into speaking past each other or why each side accuses the other of being illogical.  Are anti-vaxxers illogical?  No, they are logical, but it's a special pleading / fallacious unconventional logic that doesn't comport with the logic we culturally agree upon.  Is it wrong / dangerous?  Heck yes, but this is all to point out conventional logic, arguments, and rhetoric isn't for anti-vaxxers, it's for us and the unconvinced.  Anti-vaxxers require more, beyond convention.

I am in no way advocating for natural heard immunity, but these numbers are a bit high, as they are only based on reported cases/reported deaths. Many mild cases go unreported and the true mortality rate is lower, estimated at 0.78-1.79% in high income countries and 0.14-0.42% in low income countries [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-34-IFR/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-34-IFR/)",lfxeao,2021-02-09 22:38:18

"There are so many things wrong with what is written here.  
First, not all vaccines stop transmission. The Covid vaccines are just another one that doesn't necessarily stop transmission. Vaccines are designed to stimulate your own immune response. That's it.  
The trigger for the immune response of your body in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines is mRNA. mRNA is messenger RNA. It is used in your body to make proteins. There are over 350,000 types of human mRNA molecules. Just because a different mRNA is used in some cancer treatments is irrelevant. That's like saying a Ford sedan can't drive on the same roads as a GM sedan.  
The term pathogen is used to label an invader of the body, a cause or agent of disease of the person. A vaccine is an agent introduced into the body to stimulate an immune response.  
Using the term pathogen in reference to the vaccine is like reading a book and re-labeling the hero as the villain.",lfhbyf,2021-02-10 05:09:55

"Okay then, I’d say regarding your boss and coworkers, be honest when appropriate. Unless they outright ask you, “Hey, are you antivaxx?”, “Are you gonna take the COVID vaccine?”, “How do you feel about the vaccine?”, etc. then you don’t have to go into the full on explanation. Even if they do, it’s still your choice whether or not to engage. A good response I like to use when I don’t want to talk about a subject is, “I have a lot on my mind right now, can we talk about it later?”, or “I’m sorry. I don’t have enough information to make/have an informed opinion.”. People usually leave me alone then, or they think I need explaining to in a more gentle manner. Removes the hostility. Another thing you could do is look up who is allowed to get the vaccine right now where you’re at. I want to get the vaccine, but I am perfectly healthy and young, so I’m not a priority and won’t be able to get it for quite a while where I live. If it’s the same where you live, you can use that as an excuse to avoid the conversation completely. “I checked the register online, and I don’t qualify to get it right away. There are way more people who need it before I do, such as elderly, sick, disabled, immunocompromised, doctors, and nurses. I can wait if it means getting it to those who need it more.”. No one can literally argue with that and it should get you out of the conversation fairly quickly. Plus, it’s technically not a lie.",lfntqx,2021-02-09 00:36:32

"There is NO VACCINE THAT IS FDA APPROVED FOR SAFETY OR EFFICACY!!! AUTHORIZATION EUA is not FDA APPROVAL!!!  Period!!! 

You are volunteering to be injected with a completely new drug made from mRNA that’s unlike any other vaccine to date. It’s experimental. Most vaccines use the dead virus. It is injected via needle to tell the body to produce antibodies against that particular strain of virus. If you use flu mist, you are actually inhaling the live virus to stimulate the body’s immune response.  mRNA has never been used before so since the pharmaceutical companies have no liability, if you have adverse side effects or allergic reactions, you are SOL with your medical care or bills. 

Merck pharmaceutical company has decided not to enter the race for a vaccine 💉 quoting the CDC “Most people recover from covid-19 at home.”  I’m proud of Merck for not profiteering off uneducated, vulnerable people.

"Wanting to belong becomes bad. Nazis just wanted to belong. No, wanting to belong is a terrible reason for doing thing and has been the reason behind terrible things humanity has done.

Wanting to belong is how you get manipulated by evil people. If you have a need to belong then you are a target, that’s how they get you to believe their bullshit. They play on your desperation.

Wanting to belong isn’t a human need, it’s a sign of low self esteem. Humans already do belong, that’s being confident, only those that are insecure and need the validation of others have a need to belong. It’s not a normal human need, it’s a need that is already been taken care of by family and friends and shouldn’t be leading people into cults like anti-vaxx. If someone is desperate enough I; ind to be led into a cult then something is up beyond just needing to belong.

When people ut themselves in danger, like with anti-vax philosophy, they become a danger to society and the needs of society are important than their individual desires. In that case it’s absolutely wrong to listen to their desires. Just like it’s wrong to listen to the desires of anyone that puts society in danger.

I have no respect for anyone’s life that doesn’t have respect for mine. Antivaxxers put me in danger, put us all in danger. Antivaxxers should have their children removed from abuse and belong in prison just like people that try to blow people up with bombs or shoot people with guns.

Hep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial that would uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it to every child born in America on the first day of life. However the vaccine has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles) until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.

Hep b is injected into most newborns in the US in their first hours of life. http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Neonatal-hepatitis-B-vaccination-impaired-the-behavior-and-neurogenesis-of-mice-transiently-in-early-adulthood..pdf ⁠Biological studies empirically show that aluminum adjuvants make their way to the brain in mammals. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302736 ⁠Recent mice studies out of China demonstrate a mechanism through which those adjuvants elicit an immune response, causing neurological damage upon reaching the brain. http://vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/Wang%20Yao%202018%20Cytokine%20IL-4%20Hep%20B%20Hippocampus.pdf ⁠There is no compelling reason to vaccinate infants for hepatitis b, especially in light of this emerging science, unless the mother is hep b positive. Developed countries that do not vaccinate for hep b, like Denmark, have better under 5 health outcomes. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.dyn.mort?view=map&year_high_desc=false compare with: http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/hepatitis-b

Phamacuitical products should be thoroughly tested before  human consumption.

Source? No seriously it's the only thing that you didn't source and while this could be absolutely true, it could be happened for just a vaccine, maybe one made some time ago. Just to be safe you know. And ""pushing a narrative that vaccines are unequicvocally safe"" is not entirely true, since the same industry is forced to let the competent autorities (see the CDC) know what could be a possible side effect of the vaccination.   


>Just one percent of the reactions are reported

Yes, true. So what? The side effects chances are always reported, and consider this, by a WHO report of 2014 shows that of 10,000,000 kids vaccineted from measles, just a 100 got serious side effects. Globally.

Hep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial that would uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it to every child born in America on the first day of life. However the vaccine has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles) until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302736](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302736) ⁠Recent mice studies out of China demonstrate a mechanism through which those adjuvants elicit an immune response, causing neurological damage upon reaching the brain.

Developed countries that do not vaccinate for hep b, like Denmark, have better under 5 health outcomes.

Phamacuitical products should be thoroughly tested before  human consumption. Considering there is no compelling reason to vaccinate newborns for Hep B, if the mother is negative, we should probably pull it from the schedule at least until more animal studies give us additional insight into the role of aluminum nanoparticles in triggering an immune response/cytokines in the brain, leading to possible neurological damage.",ldtglu,2021-02-07 07:44:42
">Those diseases are not prevalent because of vaccines.

Yes, I know, my point was that heard immunity greatly reduces the risk to unvaccinated children, meaning that even for an unvaccinated child serious disease is very unlikly

>Those diseases are not prevalent because of vaccines. If people don’t get vaccines then those diseases become common again. Just like they already are.

So they are not prevalent but also common? What are you trying to say? Also I know if enough people stop vaccinating diseases come back, my point is that the risk to any particular unvaccinated child is too small to justify traumatizing the child by removing them form the family

>Also, child abuse is traumatic, as is measles and polio. If you don’t want your kids taken then don’t abuse them.

Of course children should be removed from an abusive family, I was saying that if the only problem is that they are unvaccinated the harm to the kid of removing them from the family outweighs the benefit, I was not talking about an abusive situation

There are many hundreds of thousands of antivaxers in the US, yet hardly anyone gets polio, and measles is uncommon even among antivaxers, measles is also no where near as bad as being removed from you family for most people

I am well aware of the benefits of vaccination, my point is that separating a kid from their family is likely to do more harm than leaving them unvaccinated

You run a pharmaceutical company, your main point is maximizing profit. What would you rather do? You have two choices that you can mix as you like. Option A: Supplements. Little to no testing required, low risks to make something harmful, extremely high margins of profits, little to no researches required, ""bland"" controls. Option B: you develop a drug (or a vaccine if that matters). Extensive testing, even for looong periods of time, high risks of making something harmful, lots of researchers that might lead to nothing, lots of researchers that needs to be paid a lot for long periods of time which can lead you to have little to no margins of profits, lots of controls, and, cherry on top, the risk of going in a lawsuit against customers/national agencies. 

You picked option A? Perfect. That's what pharmaceutical companies mostly profits on. Maybe you wanna also consider option B just to be helpful to society?

"Wow. You have a terrible grasp of the English language. Do you not understand how present, past, and future tense work? 

Clearly youdon’t understand how vaccines or herd immunity work.

Some people have health conditions that prevent them from getting vaccines and those are the only people that can be unvaccinated to actually have proper herd immunity. You seem to think herd immunity is just lie a certain threshold of how many people are vaccinated or something, with is a gross oversimplification of how it works. For herd immunity to be a thing then almost every person that can be vaccinated needs to be so that those that can’t get vaccinated are the still okay. Those people that can’t be vaccinated fill up the allotment of unvaccinated people. Beyond that if people don’t get vaccinated we will not achieve herd immunity.

The CDC admitted in in federal court on March 20, 2020 that they rely on only 20 studies to make the claim there is no link between vaccines and autism.

NONE of those studies looks at HBV vaccine. The CDC has no science to support that statement. The only studies they have are on MMR vaccine with thimerisol adjuvant. That product is not even in use anymore, meaning they have no basis for the claim vaccines do not cause autism. Of those now useless MMR studies, ZERO use a placebo control group. Here is a link to the court filing listing all the studies.

https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stipulation-and-Order-Fully-Executed.pdf

How can they study one vaccine (poorly) and claim that ALL vaccines are safe when these products have completely different ingredients. None of the 20 studies involved an aluminum adjuvanted vaccine.

This product is also linked, by peer reviewed research, to MS. The largest observational study of HBV and MS is this French study, demonstrating a link:

"Heard immunity actually is a threshold, the percent of people who must be successfully immunized to stop an outbreak can be calculated by the formula 1-(1/R0) where R0 is the transmission rate of the disease in question in an  population with no immunity [https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/17/calculating-our-way-to-herd-immunity/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/17/calculating-our-way-to-herd-immunity/)

Now vaccines are not 100% effective, so if we have a 90% effective vaccine only 90% of vaccinated people are successfully immunized 

Once we know the heard immunity threshold and the vaccine effectiveness the minimum necessary vaccination rate can be calculated by the formula H\*(100/E), where H is the heard immunity threshold in percent, and E is the vaccine effectiveness in percent

Knowing this we can calculate how many people must be vaccianted for measles, the R0 is 12-18 [https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/how-scientists-quantify-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-covid-19](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/how-scientists-quantify-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-covid-19), so we will use 18 to be safe, we don't want to underestimate the needed vaccination rate. Using the formula for heard immunity threshold with an R0 of 18 gives us 1-(1/18)=0.94444444444444444444, so lets just round up to 95 to be safe 

Now for the second formula, the CDC says that a 2 dose series of MMR is 99% effective [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#schedule) so we have 95\*(100/99) which gives us a decimal number ever so slightly below 96, meaning that 96% of the population must be vaccinated to reliably prevent measles outbreaks, but up to 4% unvaccinated people is OK

I cannot find stats on the total number of people who cannot be vaccinated, these stats seem to only be kept for children. In California, a state with strict vaccine requirements for school, the rate of exemptions for medical reasons was 0.9% in kindergartners as of 2019 [https://sd06.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-06-05-new-data-released-today-shows-percentage-medical-exemptions-have-more-quadrupled](https://sd06.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-06-05-new-data-released-today-shows-percentage-medical-exemptions-have-more-quadrupled) this means that a kindergarten class could maintain heard immunity to measles with up to 3% of the class being antivax

I used measles because it is one of the most contagious diseases there is, heard immunity thresholds vary by disease

If everyone actually followed the rules, like they were doing until the summer, our numbers would be much better.

"I know Brian Deer is an investigative journalist and not a doctor or scientist. He has been shown to be correct as you would have seen in the links that I posted. Just because you dislike Murdoch, doesn't detract from Deer's credibility.

It isn't a corporate attack on a scientist exposing damaging information but the medical authorities removing the medical licence of a crook after substantial investigation. Just so you know, Murdoch wasn't part of that decision. Wakefield, who was the main culprit here hasn't had his licence restored and that isn't going to happen.

The articles that linked show a possible link (unconfirmed) between the measles virus and intestinal issues in 'some' autistic children. Your description of 'autistic patients suffer from measles infection in the gut' is a completely misleading and wrong description. That is not what the articles say and no link was suggested between the MMR vaccine and those medical issues. So no joy for Wakefield or his supporters.

William Thompson has indeed made claims but has never offered any evidence to support those claims and his colleagues don't support those claims. So it's very hard to give those claims any credibility when the evidence shows there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This has been shown in numerous studies over many years and the only claim is based on fabricated data.

It is quite noticeable that you jump all over claims that have no supporting evidence while ignoring the numerous studies that show the opposite. Why is that? You attack the messenger while ignoring the evidence supporting the message. Why is that? Your mate Wakefield is a fraudster who has been caught out but has bounced back and is making a heap of money from frightening people with antivax bullshit.The evidence against Wakefield is both substantial and compelling, yet you conveniently ignore that. Why is that?

"What evidence against Wakefield, the several similar studies replicating his work? What heap of money, the 60bn that vaccines bring in annually for these companies?

William Thompson is making claims about his own study...

Why are you ignoring the implications of the other measles/gut studies? They have the same kind of data and conclusions about MMR and measles as the lancet study. Have you read the lancet study or just articles about it?

For you a journalist paid by a pharmaceutical manufacturer is credible, but a senior CDC scientist impeaching his own work is not? Interesting...

It’s not that I don’t like Rupert Murdoch, it’s that he is on the board of GSK and has a son on the board of Merck (MMR vaccine manufacturer) while simultaneously paying Deer’s salary.

https://ahrp.org/laffaire-wakefield-conflicts-of-interest/

These studies all draw the same conclusions as Wakefield. His lancet paper did not implicate vaccines specifically, but MMR was the only source of measles that these children were exposed to.

This prevents you from even reaching the infectious stage ordinarily.

"It is 65 years since a “wonder drug” as a palliative to morning sickness in pregnant women was brought to the market, first in Germany where Grünenthal manufactured Contergan, and then in the UK where it was known principally as Thalidomide. The drug was not properly tested in Germany, and was not tested at all in the UK. Just look at the horrendous results — many thousands of teratogenic foetuses and live births. Lives and families were destroyed.
Only the insistence of the late Dr Frances Kelsey at the US Food and Drug Administration that there had to be evidence of the safety of Thalidomide before approving it for sale prevented a catastrophe in that country. A disaster must not be born out of a mad rush for a Covid vaccine.

"You shouldn’t. Seriously, look into the research (although limited) instead of listening to the repeated narrative “vaccines are totally safe and good!”

Overall, vaccinated children are more immune to the diseases they were immunized against but less healthy overall compared to unvaccinated children, per a recent study. 

But the real concern is lack of research surrounding vaccine safety. Why are there more vaccine mandates without adequate studies? Just a question...

From what I have seen of antivaxers they really think that vaccines are harmful, why do you say they do it to feel special? There was I time when I really thought vaccines were bad

And how is saying autism is a vaccine injury evidence of bad motives?

"I used to be antivax, I believed that life threatening disease was less likely that serious complications of vaccination, I'm not really someone who is very scared of infections, I'm generally healthy and serious infections are not common for healthy people where I live (US), vaccinated or not, so I have never been too concerned about disease prevention, in the unlikely event that I did get a life threatening disease my plan was the same as it is now, go to the hospital

"**Preventing myself from getting a vaccine preventable life threatening disease:**

Well, I don't think there is such a thing. After many many hours of research into the topic I've come to the conclusion that vaccines not only cannot prevent anything they also contain a lot of toxic gick that is hard for your body to get rid of.

That being said, if you don't want to experience dis-ease then I advocate a few simple things:

1. Eat clean healthy non-genetically modified foods that were not grown with toxic pesticides.
2. Drink clean water (definitely not flouride laden water) and clean vegetable and fruit juices (again non-gmo, non peticide)
3. Get some exercise. Our lymph system doesn't function well unless we actually move around a bit... and if it isn't functioning well we cannot get rid of toxins very well... eventually causing dis-ease.
4. Get some sun. And no, don't wear toxic laden sun screens.
5. Have fun and enjoy life. Don't forget to smile.

**Getting better from dis-ease:**

Well, since I started doing the above I have not experienced any dis-ease beyond sore muscles when I over exert myself.

However, if I do get sick then I'll just double down on the above 5 things in addition to taking a step back and trying to determine what kinds of toxins I am still exposing myself to.

Basically, my ""treatment"" would be to give my body what it needs to heal itself (rest, nutrition) and stop exposure to toxins that I can identify.

I'm fairly surprised that so many here on reddit think those (like me) that wouldn't touch a so called vaccine with a 20 foot pole are crazy.  

Of course, I shouldn't be surprised as no one wants to admit that their kids problems just might be because of all the toxic garbage they have them injected with (along with the toxic food they feed them.

The simple fact that us dumb tax payers have paid billions of dollars out to people damaged by vaccines (see VAERS) should be enough to tell anyone that they (at the very least) are not as safe as our brain washed health care workers would like to believe.

downvote all you want... but if your kids start having serious problems not long after getting a ""safe"" vaccine then hopefully you put 1 and 1 together and get 2... without knowing what caused a problem it because much harder to address it. Hopefully they don't suddenly become autistic or dead.

It is worth noting that even if I believed that vaccines work I'd still only get a fraction of those that are currently pushed simply because I'd weigh the potential effects (death, autism, paralysis, etc.) against the potential benefits. 

Oh... and I won't even start on the insanity of giving vaccines to pregnant women (and so their fetuses) or babies...",l77a14,2021-02-01 04:34:15
All of you people are unbelievably stupid it’s scary to know there are so many of you. Never been vaccinated neither have my siblings. Never have either of us gotten a life threatening disease.

Well for one I eat a very healthy diet and don’t put junk into my body. I eat a plant based diet and make sure I am getting enough vitamins and everything like that and I get sick maybe once every two years with a cold at most. I don’t have allergies or any health problems. I am aware of disease and know it does happen and is serious but when I was born my parents made the choice to not vaccinate based on the research they had done talking to different doctors and the studies my mom had done and they decided it would be best not to do it and we have been fine. As I got older I did my own research and looked at both sides and ultimately made the choice to continue not to be vaccinated. Believe it or not our bodies can heal themselves that’s what they are suppose to do and how life is now with over sanitizing and Clorox wipes does more harm than good. Breathing in that stuff is what will make you sick with the amount of harmful chemicals. And a lot of the reasons people are so sick these days is because of what they put into their body if you aren’t eating a good diet you will be sick,l77a14,2021-01-29 03:12:00

Well first of all your doctor doesn’t know what is in vaccines or how they work they are only taught the schedule of when to give them. I personally know this because my mom is a doctor along with a lot of her friends and my family and I have heard this over and over again. They are taught not to question it. Now think about this. Vaccine manufacturers can not be held liable for anything that happens to you after you get a vaccine. They make a lot of money from vaccines so you would think that if they believed that people wouldn’t have bad reactions to vaccinations that they wouldn’t mind being held liable because they would only have to pay out a small number of people.,l542h4,2021-01-26 19:58:21
"ok maybe where u r, but in *Chicago*, apparently it's different. My doctor tells me *exactly* what is inside them, the percentage of how effective it is, the importance of it, and the side effects. Please keep in mind that all vaccines must be approved by the CDC",l542h4,2021-01-26 20:06:05

">	Do you guys have a Received Pronunciation over there? I don’t know a single person that sounds like Hugh Grant.

Received or perceived?  In America, Hugh Grant is basically the King Brit since he’s handsome, has a very thick accent, and is the only Brit without funky teeth.  Then there’s Piers Morgan and John Oliver.  Piers reinforces negative stereotypes since he’s such an elitist douche, and comes as no surprise for how people would expect a condescending Brit to be, especially coming to America and whining non-stop about how bad America sucks.  Everyone is just like, “Then go home, you whiny bitch” and it’s similar to Californians crying non-stop about Texas, but refusing to leave.

For everything else, it’s basically a thick accent and something to the effect of, “Oi, mate! You fooking tosser cunt, where’s your license for your telly, guv’ner? That’ll be a fine for the queen’s tea and crumpets! Now get out me way and let me watch me BBC! Doctor Who is on!” but that can also apply to Australians, and to a much lesser degree, New Zealand.

"There are RFID chips you can get implanted to do things like pay with your hand and bring someone to a webpage (by using their phones RFID reader). BUT while they are relatively small there is NO WAY you could fit it into something like a flu shot, (for reference here is a video from the modern Rogue in which [Jason Gets an implant in his hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZiRISGdQ4g)). In this video they have an expert that mentions that they have a VERY limited range and need to be within inches of the reader, so they are not going to be able to track you from space like in a James Bond movie. 

As for them making it small enough to not be noticed in a normal vaccine, with today's batteries and electronics there is no way it would be able to have a big enough battery with a strong enough antenna or signal, to be useful for any amount of time if at all, without having to be within inches of the reader.

This is why they use RFID for these implants, as it can be relatively small because it gets its power from the device reading it and it is close to the reader so it does not need a strong signal.

You just proved my point. You couldn’t even understand what I was saying,l3k080,2021-01-24 06:58:13
See the thing is my mom is a doctor and my grandfather has worked on vaccines for a lot of his life. He knows people who took part in this vaccine and those people have backed out saying that they do not think it’s safe and they are missing a bunch of safety steps. If you go to the cdc website it says there is not enough research to know if this is safe for immunocompromised individuals. Doctors have come out saying don’t take this vaccine if you are not doing to die from getting the virus. There is no way it is safe vaccines take years to make and it’s been less than a year. Even the people that are considered high risk still have a 94.6% survival rate. And also you have to take into consideration the people that they counted as dying from this virus when in fact they were going to die anyways. It happened to my uncle. He was dying because of multiple strokes he had and when he was in the hospital in his last days he tested positive. They said he died from the virus with isn’t true.

I have friends who weren't careful why they weren't in risk groups, and they seriously affected other people. And about the vaccine, it's obviously rushed, why shouldn't it be? But just because it was rushed doesn't mean it's unsafe, just because it was rushed doesn't mean it wasn't tested.

"Just to prove you wrong - I’m a provaxxer. Here’s what’s in both COVID vaccines. None of these are identified as toxic in the doses present in the vaccine. In fact 99% of this stuff is present in a normal physiological setting. 


What’s in the Pfizer COVID vaccine:

mRNA
These Lipids used to transport and protect the mRNA from degradation:

(4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis
(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide
1,2-Distearoyl-snglycero-3- phosphocholine
cholesterol
Salts to keep the mRNA from being damaged at physiological pH:

potassium chloride
monobasic potassium phosphate
sodium chloride
dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate

Basic Glucose

What’s in the Moderna Vaccine:

mRNA

These Lipids to protect and deliver the mRNA payload:

SM-102
1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 [PEG2000-DMG]
cholesterol
1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]

Acetic Acid - Buffering the pH at the injection site

Tromethamine & Tromethamine hydrochloride - More buffering agents to keep the pH from changing.

Sodium acetate - again pH buffering

Sucrose

"Most likely it is because most folks do not critically think about anything and would prefer everyone listens to corporations to make choices on the world's behalf. They are still Entrance repeating all the stuff they heard on their respective official mediums and influencers on social media.  Google and most of the world have their back on this one so it makes them feel good emotionally to get supported on their world view.

 antivax folks now have a negative stigma which negates any validity to their points even if one or two out of ten are legit and they know it.  Some will use that to appear unbiased as they scavage the webs in search of more evidence for their issued beliefs and they are scared so it is not their fault.  Sunshine and rainbows are issued to those that follow the CDC cult.

Polio is actually a bad example to compare to Covid as it's a one and done.  There is no money in a cure thus Covid will be a federally mandated flu shot whose effectiveness varies due ""multiple strains that we will likely soon learn about as it modifies to increase revenue streams"" 

If they cared so much they would share the recipe so other large corporations can help get us the same shit but nah make it feel hard to get to influence folks to get it more expeditiously while coordinating round 2.

People should be more positive about Covid, less folks died of the common flu this past year!

I'm pro choice on vaccines.  several vaccines are helpful but ones like this are glorified flu shots in which scientist are likely paid to prove its effectiveness with the support of the media on their side.  Hey their families also need to eat.  

Chop chop, get your shots and worry about yourself and family.  No we can't force teenagers into federally mandated birth control to save our future children either.  We can educate them and equip them to make better choices though ;)",l1pr4g,2021-01-21 09:10:34

So, if someone says they don’t want to get the smallpox vaccine, there’s still a chance they could get it from people who carry the virus, couldn’t they?  And it’s possible to be vaccinated and carry the virus. 

So is the disease really eradicated, or do we just all have antibodies to the existing disease?  I think those are different things.",l1pr4g,2021-01-21 03:54:30

I would like to ask you to stop using my own, along with many others’, neurological condition as a cheap political point. I would have expected that by now, you all would let go of stereotypes and stigma surrounding autism, yet you parade the idea around that autism is a bad and unforgiving “disease” that leaves a child as a “stupid vegetable that won’t be able to do anything in life.” Instead of taking into consideration what I, my family and many people like me have to deal with, you say that my existence is a mere mistake of medical mismanagement and error of corporate greed. That my existence is proof of the corruption that exists were there is no corruption. 

This is frankly hurtful and akin to racism or sexism. If you can’t go around saying that all black people are criminals that must be avoided, why can you still go around saying that autistic people have something deeply wrong with them and that this outcome must be avoided as well. Autism is a spectrum, and there are many people with it more worse off than me, but I and my family have worked hard to get here, and to say that it was the product of a gross mistake and waste of human life is just sick.

"Norwegian here. This is such a non story it almost hasn't been covered in news papers at all. So a quick backstory; Norway has done pretty well throughout the whole pandemic. We are currently at about 50.000 confirmed cases, and 500 deaths. Numbers have been a bit high this fall and over Christmas but are currently down to 2-400 daily infected. Given these circumstances, our vaccination strategy is to start with the most frail and elderly in hospitals and care homes, since that is where most deaths have occurred. 

Any vaccine has side effects, which can include a light fever, nausea etc. The people who have died have been in such a poor state that their body has not been able to handle these mild side effects. These people were sadly on their last breath, and wouldn't have survived much longer if they weren't given the vaccine.

"Norway has started so far vaccinated over 25.000 with the Pfizer Biontec vaccine.
29 reported cases of side effects.
23 reported deaths. So far only 13 examinated and confirmed as a result of side effects such as fever/nausea.

Only old and frail elderly people who died. All older than 80, some of them 90 y.o. 

Governmental (FHI - General Health institute) recommendations changed as it may not be wise to vaccinate people with such reduced general health.

"I think we’ve got our wires crossed, I’m not in this screenshot, it’s just a conversation I stumbled across on Facebook (where else lol) the people in the conversation are colour coded, basically it’s an anti-vaxxer who is using this article as a basis for their anti-vaxx logic without realising it’s click bait and nothing to do with vaccine deaths, the person they tagged has read the article and has drawn the same conclusion as you (by reading as such) and therefore challenging the anti-Vaxxer who admits they haven’t actually read it but in their typical fashion “are still right” hope that has cleared things up, we’re laughing at them :)",kzefnj,2021-01-22 20:18:06
"No. Correlation is a measure of the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. Causation is when change in one variable causes change in another.

Variables can be correlated, but not have a causal link. For example in fictional city A, the rate of prostitution and the number of churches increased at the same rate. A smart man understands that one didn't cause the other, but both are simply caused by a population increase. There isn't a causal link, but it's not a coincidence either.",kzefnj,2021-01-17 23:55:52

"I haven't read the article but here's a guess. If you're in a nursing home you are going to get the vaccine early. If you're in a nursing home you are probably also old, frail and sickly. Therefore, if you're in a nursing home you will probably get the vaccine and you will probably also die soon. Ergo, people in a nursing home that get the vaccine are more likely to die than 20 year olds that get the disease (but only since they were more likely to die in the first place).",kzefnj,2021-01-18 06:24:44

"Not necessarily. You want to vaccinate those who are at a greater risk of serious illness. Those who are at the greatest risk are also generally frail and have a bunch of other problems, so getting the vaccine is correlated with dying because we give the vaccine to those who have the greatest risk of dying.

It's like how a high vitamin D level is highly correlated with a more positive health outcome for almost all diseases. Yet vitamin D supplements have never been shown to have the same effect. See if you can figure that one out :)",kzefnj,2021-01-18 12:06:57

Mattress Firm - This is the only one I would potentially change. If there's a slot between Speculation Line and Leaving Reality, I think it should go there. I did try to do some basic math on Mattress Firm once just based on bed prices, what it probably costs to have a brick and mortar store, employee wages, and it really doesn't take a whole lot of beds for it to make financial sense, especially if they get you on that payment plan thing. BUT there's just something a bit odd about why there are so many stores in such close proximity to each other. Perhaps they just have that many so they can keep more inventory in an area.

Bigfoot - What a great story. I'm weird on this one too.

I think Matt Groening is a time travel > Greta Thunberg is a time traveler. The Simpsons got close to right on a lot of future shit and absolutely nailed some of them.

"""Illuminati"" should be in the ""Things That Really Happened"" section, as the Bavarian Illuminati, lead by Adam Weishaupt, was real and nobody denies its historical existence.  

Also, putting Bigfoot and Cryptids in unequivocally false but leaving UFOs and Area 51 in ""We Have Questions"" is hilarious.  Cryptids as a category are the most likely to produce real evidence, since new species are discovered all the time.  Bigfoot seems highly unlikely, but is at least well within the realm of scientific plausibility.

My dad -- a green beret -- worked security at Area 51 in the 1960s, while he was on light duty recovering from some combat injuries.  He saw the SR-1 Blackbird land and take off from the facility decades before the government admitted its existence.  Area 51 has nothing to do with aliens.  When Lockheed-Martin was test flying their experimental planes, they launched from outside Los Angeles, flew to Area 51, refueled, then flew back.

"NGL it looks like your political bias is seeping into this one.

Obama's Birth Certificate is 2 places above Prince Charles is a Vampire.  If you ignore the specific people, do you really think it's less rational to believe a world leader was born outside of the country than it is to believe a world leader is a fictional villain?  Also, why wouldn't Charles be placed in the same category as the other ""world leaders are a fictional villain"" conspiracy theory at the top?

The Mattress Firm and Wayfair conspiracies are functionally the same (Company is a cover for xxx illegal actions) but one is 2 ranks higher because it's peddled by Q instead of redditors?

Cultural Marxism is at the very top, well above completely bogus stuff like crop circles, despite some of its claims actually happening in the 60s.  Obviously the greater conspiracy is wrong, but things like 5G have absolutely no basis in reality and are lower.

The Wildfires conspiracy is based on the fact that [people were setting wildfires in Oregon](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?auth=login-google).  If  speculating who shot JFK and for what purpose is just ""we have questions"", why is speculating who started the fires and for what purpose ""get help""?

"If you really don't believe that the wealthy are part of the same social groups due to living in similar areas and believing the same issues, then your are a fool. Its like how people living in the same areas and who frequently talk to one another tend to believe in the same issues because they hear the same or similar points being made non-stop and don't talk to people outside of their social circles. 

Now realize that they also have the resources to manipulate public opinion. If the owner of a major news network decides that they are for fracking, then anti-fracking ideas aren't going to be spread on the things they control. Kind of like how you aren't going to put a bumper sticker on the back of your car for a cause you actively disagree with.

Added to the fact that you push for ideas that advance your own self interests. If you are making money by discrediting certain ideas, then you don't really care what the consequences of those ideas are. Especially since you have the money to protect yourself and those you care about from the consequences of those ideas. If the consequences are centered in a country, then you move out of the country. If it is centered in the environment, then you move to where it is more livable.

Added to the fact that, especially in the most recent election, we have seen political candidates actively rejected by media sources, I.E. Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders. Hell, in the case of Yang, people have left major news networks and called them out for doing this.",kxxaw4,2021-01-15 22:32:11

Not for souls or something but because Jewish people could do things like lend money/usury, things the church didn’t approve of and didn’t allow Christians to do.

Everything I have heard around these people all sounds so similar to pre ww2 that I have been so suspicious. First you hear things being controlled by small elite next you usually hear Jews. Now my suspicions are confirmed and I was glad to read this thread and know that you guys and girls aren’t giving into this stuff. Even if there were some shadow jewish elite I don’t know why then the logical decision is to makes us all suffer. After getting bar mitzfahed I was not told of any secret anything.

Some of the most notorious flat-earth books have various reasons why Jews did it, or how they are helping do it;

\>  The Jews stirred up the people, who then persuaded the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, to crucify Jesus. “\[T\]he chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.” (Matthew 27:20) The methods used by the Jews have not changed. Today the Jews control the mass media, which they use to propagandize the people into pushing the politicians into doing their bidding against God and his anointed (406).

"> Faked moon landing

Here is a funny bit about the faked Moon Landing: If you believe that the Moon Landing was faked, then all of the Cold War was fake. The USSR (and several other countries) had the technological prowess to check whether Nasa landed on the moon and a vested interest in ridiculing the USA.

So why did they not ring the Bell? Either the Moon landings are real, or the Cold War was a huge Charade, and then you are deep into Secret World Government/New World Order/Illuminati/whatever Territory, and sooner or later (((They))), or ""The Rothschilds"" or ""The Globalist Elite"" or whatever Codeword for Jews is in this year pops up.",kxxaw4,2021-01-15 20:11:11
"I've done enough research to say that almost every extra crazy theory leads back to Zionisim, hollow earth and hollow moon having secret *jew* bases inside them, the moon landing was faked by the Hollywood elites who are also Jewish, Bill gates is actually Will Gatesberg or something similar.

A lot of conspiracy theories grab you with interesting possible truths and if you're susceptible you fall down the rabbit hole and then it's easy for that source to peddle more false information to you because in your mind ""they're the only ones who'll tell me the truth.",kxxaw4,2021-01-15 20:32:40

Oh, also Jews are in on it too, for some reason."". I really do not understand what it is about Jewish people that makes them such a prominent target for conspiracy theorists.",kxxaw4,2021-01-15 22:17:13
"Well, I agree that believing the earth is flat isn´t anti-semitic, but to the question ""why should nasa/politicians lie to you in this case?"" many Flat Earthers respond that there is a (jewish) elite who is behind all these lies and so on - my point is, some of these theories aren´t anti-semitic on their own, many of their followers are.",kxxaw4,2021-01-15 22:17:14
"They're linked to the grand unified conspiracy illuminati satanic Qanon bullshit that is definitely anti-Semitic. I have heard it directly from people's mouths in real life that these things are all connected. However, they are also just batshit crazy conspiracy theories that can be espoused on their own without being connected to this. That was more common 10 or 20 years ago, though, most conspiracy people today are all in on the Qanon or Lizard People shit.",kxxaw4,2021-01-15 22:31:45
"Anti-semitism is the 'ur-conspiracy' of western conspiracy theories. The kinds of anti-semitic conspiracies of the 19th century (e.g. protocols of elders of zion) said that there was a secret jewish cabal, simultaneously bankers and communists, plotting world domination and using special magic or technology to control events from behind the scenes.

Hollow/flat earth, moon landing, require a massive global coverup to make sense. This coverup has to be done by some behind the scenes cabal (the word cabal literally coming from Kabbalah, i.e. Jewish mysticism).

This cabal, in the conspiracist imagination, tends to be Jewish. People who study conspiracy theories notice great structural similarities between Nazi or Tsarist or other historic antisemitisms (the behind the scenes Jewish clique controlling the world) and modern conspiracy theories around the NWO or whatever. Not only are there structural similarities and similar themes/ideas, but conspiracist communities tend to have a Nazi core that explicitly name Jews as the root of the problem. Conspiracy theories are also (seen a lot now) a common entry-point into the far right, again, with an explicitly anti-semitic Nazi core.

So the point isn't that every single flat earther or 'moon landing faked' believer is an antisemite. Its just that conspiracist beliefs of all types are closely associated with anti-semitism, both in terms of communities of conspiracists and the beliefs themselves. Hope this helps!",kxxaw4,2021-01-15 22:32:01

"This is a misconception about UFOs in general. There are actually two distinct kinds of unknowns which are considered in these UFO programs (at least in the case of Project Bluebook, the COMETA report, and the French UFO program). The first is unidentified due to insufficient information, and this is what most people think of (if they don’t think alien spaceship, that is). It’s impossible to identify because you just don’t have the information, so it could literally be anything. In the case of project bluebook, these were classified as “insufficient information.”

The second kind of unidentified are the truly unidentified objects, as in the real head scratchers. These are cases where there is plenty of information (multiple sightings from the ground and the air, radar returns, heightened radiation, electromagnetic interference etc), but despite the available evidence, it can’t be matched to any known phenomenon. Because of the circumstances required to gain this sort of evidence (multiple planes, radar, etc) these types of sightings are usually military ones.

If you want to take a deep dive into this subject WITHOUT getting into the crazy shit about little green men or abductions, check out the book UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record by Leslie Kean. It stays grounded in reality and just gives you the facts based off of FOIA released documents, pilot testimony, the testimony of multiple generals, one NASA scientist, and several rather impressive photos. It covers the history of how the stigma around this subject happened, how most nations are not nearly as opposed to talking about UFOs as the US, and some of the most convincing cases. I cannot recommend this book enough",kxxaw4,2021-01-16 01:21:39

"Some facts: 

There has never a single case of the vaccines being anywhere near as dangerous as the diseases they were supposed to prevent 

Millions of people already had them and allergic reactions that could be cured within a few hours were the worst thing that happened to them 

They took less to develop than usually but that's because they didn't have to be developed from scratch, they reduced the bureaucracy and merged some phases of testing, which shouldn't affect safety. Also the amount of knowledge the scientists have today is way better than when the early vaccines were developed which means that they're less likely to really fuck it up

The pharmaceutical companies are definitely not trustworthy but they just couldn't allow themselves to release a dangerous vaccine because with the amount of media coverage covid gets and skepticism around the vaccines their reputation would be gone forever if they failed",kx6tc6,2021-01-14 16:29:35

"Don't think of it as ""safe"" or ""unsafe""; think of it in terms of risk management.

To be honest, there is a tiny risk of side effects with the covid-19 vaccine.  Most of them are transient, but it is not zero risk.

There is a much larger risk of long term side effects if you get covid, and we really don't have any data about how long they last.  Some people are having a really, really bad time.  Google ""long covid"".

I do not however get a flu (I’m using a virus vaccine for reference) vaccine because that has been proven to be somewhere between 40 and 50% effective according to the CDC. My concern with Covid is that there are new strains making rounds. The world health organization gets together and reviews which strains of the flu virus have been making people sick and decide which strains the next season’s vaccine should cover. If Covid has multiple strains making rounds, then how do we know the vaccine will be effective against those new strains?

If you had* to develop antibodies for the virus, then you really only have two choices - take the vaccine or actively seek out someone with the virus, get them to cough all over you, then to being extra careful make sure you do not infect anyone else, be bed ridden for X days till you develop the antibodies naturally.

Theoretically if you did it right, it should not matter to others which way you choose to do it, because ultimately you develop the antibodies both ways. But when I think of it like that.. the shot starts to sound more appealing",kx6tc6,2021-01-15 02:40:31

"Hi, I don't have the time right now but I will try to find some links to data and the scientific analysis of it later.

Not every strain will have had mutations that change the surface protein of the virus, this surface protein is what your immune system responds to and is what vaccines recreate so that your immune system responds to the real virus. Scientists are testing the vaccines alongside the new variants to see if they work with them, I'm sure when they have a firm answer we will all be told!

Also, do you actually have the opportunity to get the vaccine in the next 18 months? Look at your local criteria for priority, usually based on covid risk with age, occupation, conditions?  You may also be allowed to defer. Even though they are now ""on the market"" scientists will still be testing the vaccines and doctors and scientists will look into any reported adverse effects (from the millions that will have been vaccinated), I believe by the time I am offered a COVID vaccine (a year or so from now) that there will have been plenty of testing .
Related to this, it seems the COVID vaccine tests had very large numbers of participants (40k ish?), so they do have quite a thorough testing already, and any side effects would already have presented.

"Some people get seriously ill from the same illness that you could have a very high chance of surviving. There is the risk that you could become really ill, but you also could cope really well. The issue is protecting those who are vulnerable and at risk, who dont have as high chance at survival.

A good example is that I'm luckily mostly healthy. I do have asthma but it's well controlled so it's likely that I would survive, and my immune system would work as it should. Theres a risk of me becoming more severely ill and a very small risk of death, but chances are I'll get away with feeling rough for a week or two. That risk is low, but never zero. The problem is, my grandma has cancer that has destroyed her immune system. She can become extremely ill from the common cold, never mind anything worse. Her risk of death is marginally higher than most people she therefore hasnt left her home since march except for her appointments. For her, this is literally life or death and the vaccine is her way to returning to normality. 

I'm having the vaccine because I dont want to be poorly, but it's worth everyone getting the vaccine so people like my grandma can have a chance at surviving.",kx6tc6,2021-01-14 16:24:49

In order for your completely BS 99.8% number to be true, we'd need to have missed 900 *million* cases (IE we only are capturing 1/10 of the total cases).  Although possible, this is *extremely* improbable.  

Username most definitely does *not* check out.",kx6tc6,2021-01-14 18:32:12
"1% death rate is a more realistic estimate. If you assume that the healthcare everywhere is gonna be capable of keeping it like that no matter how many people get infected and if you assume that the amount of people that can get infected twice is negligible, and that the antibodies will work against all mutations, which are all very optimistic assumptions we're talking about 70 million deaths worldwide before reaching the herd immunity 

Meanwhile none of the vaccines have killed anyone",kx6tc6,2021-01-14 20:05:08
"That could be 15,600,000 worldwide. Herd immunity requires a large amount of a population to get the virus.

It's also not a realistic percentage of cases Vs deaths.

It also doesn't account for people who aren't going to be treated for other illnesses or injuries because hospitals are overrun with cv-19 patients. 

Also the effects of long covid are apparent on people who have not died.

The immunity of catching the virus naturally is only suspected at about 5 months for many people [link](https://www.scotsman.com/health/coronavirus/previous-covid-infection-could-give-immunity-5-months-you-can-still-transmit-virus-3100191?amp) and you can still transmit the virus in that time.

This vaccine could give protection for a year or more and give us enough time to wipe out this virus enough to get a handle on things and get the world running back to normal.

Here we're having a 1500 deaths some days, partly because we let people meet up for Christmas a few weeks ago. With lockdowns our numbers go down but when things are relaxed the number go right back up again.

World needs to get on, whilst saving the lives of people we love and care about. Including their life of not having to live with long term effects for years afterwards.

This is the quickest, safest way for us to move on.

Your immune system does not get weaker from being taught these viruses exist, it's safer for you. If you catch measles naturally it can wipe out your immune system against other illnesses you would normally fend off for ages afterwards. Fighting an actual virus can wipe out your body and you need rest, and can have a slow immune response afterwards. 
These vaccines with examples and pieces of viruses or ones that mimic weaker versions etc, do not give you the virus but they do teach your body how to recognise and fight it quicker so you either barely notice catching it or get it much less severely than you would have had it.

Think of anyone you know with asthma, over 50-60, has cancer,now on immunosuppressents etc. Someone you know and care about has something that will make this a possible problem for them. 

Sure, you may have a low risk if you catch it, but for many that risk is a lot higher. There's millions of these people in the world, and as the virus spreads more then it's only likely to get more variants and change behaviours.

The longer we get this go on at this high infection rate where the virus multiplies so many times over, the more chances you have for mutations to occur, until eventually we will need to come up with a new vaccine.

At the moment we have the means to start protecting, stop the spread as much as possible.

If you only cared about someone besides yourself then maybe that would mean something to you.

All countries should be have the same rule as Indonesia- caught without a facemask, dig graves for those who have died of this disease.

It's all too real, it's more deadly then reading numbers and pretending they're not a big deal means to you.

US has a 9/11s worth of deaths a day (3922 today). UK is currently around 1000 to 1500 deaths a day. Total worldwide deaths recorded for the 12th of January was 9,371.

"I do payroll and have two coworkers but we are virtual. The station I have an office at (which I don't use often) has 2k employees that I oversee paychecks and premiums for. It's a wierd dynamic. They aren't our employees because I am not a supervisor to them per se but I help manage their accounts and make payments as well as remove and add accounts. I don't input time usually, but the timekeepers come to us for guidance because we are the next step above them though we are not the supervisors to them either because we belong to a separate entity still. It's a convoluted mess of hierarchy so we just refer to them as 'our employees' because we are in charge of the accounts divided by alpha and stations. When someone dies of covid or something else, we are notified and take action. When someone needs special payment for covid leave or the shot or side effects, we facilitate it. That was a very wordy response and I'm not sure it made much sense for your question but it's a term or responsibility/endearment for me.",kx6tc6,2021-01-15 02:23:21

"I'm pro vax too, but this whole thing is unsourced and contains falsehoods

>**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

This is false according to world health organization, serious reactions are rare, but can happen [https://www.who.int/initiatives/the-global-vaccine-safety-initiative/tools-and-methods/reaction-rates-information-sheets](https://www.who.int/initiatives/the-global-vaccine-safety-initiative/tools-and-methods/reaction-rates-information-sheets)

>Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported.

You need to cite a source for this

>One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects**

This also needs a source, you cannot expect to be taken seriously if you don't link the study

>In 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability**

No, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 **reduced** manufacturer liability [https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/98/6/1179](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/98/6/1179)

>One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects**

Again you claim something with no source

>**Andrew Wakefield,** ...... is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**.

Also false [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mauricio\_Barreto/publication/254468384\_Outbreak\_of\_Aseptic\_Meningitis\_associated\_with\_Mass\_Vaccination\_with\_a\_Urabe-containing\_Measles-Mumps-R\_ubella\_Vaccine/links/548deb3c0cf2d1800d842001/Outbreak-of-Aseptic-Meningitis-associated-with-Mass-Vaccination-with-a-Urabe-containing-Measles-Mumps-R-ubella-Vaccine.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mauricio_Barreto/publication/254468384_Outbreak_of_Aseptic_Meningitis_associated_with_Mass_Vaccination_with_a_Urabe-containing_Measles-Mumps-R_ubella_Vaccine/links/548deb3c0cf2d1800d842001/Outbreak-of-Aseptic-Meningitis-associated-with-Mass-Vaccination-with-a-Urabe-containing-Measles-Mumps-R-ubella-Vaccine.pdf)

>The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of  horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of  mass psychogenic events

Yet again no source...

>The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals

No source

>The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in  children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and  thoroughly investigated for safety

No source

>\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of  carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no  issues have been found.

No source, I'm honestly starting to wonder if you are an antivaxer trying to make fun of pro vaxers by claiming vaccines perfectly safe without any sources

>It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of  allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

You really need to cite sources for a claim like this, vaccines aren't even designed to prevent allergies

>It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer

No source

>Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

I think this may be true but you need a source

>France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has  higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed  countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

"I there should be some clarity with these things because there is misleading or lack of proper information on both sides of the argument. Doing a little research there is in fact a distinction that I don't think the CDC or the WHO have addressed although I could be wrong. When it comes to an airborne virus, there are masks that are effective and some that are ineffective.  

I'll link one study [https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577), but over time I have come across several studies and I believe some from the CDC themselves when discussing other viruses in the past. The use of cloth masks which a majority of people are using have been found to be very ineffective against airborne viruses including Covid-19. Surgical masks offer better protection, but in actually it should be n95 or better for viral protection.  

There is an issue with availability, but if the CDC was genuine with their concerns, they should maintain the public well informed to try and get the proper mask for the situation. There should be a push to have companies produce the proper masks, however, I don't see much of anyone pointing this out anymore.  

So as it stands, as I stated earlier, there should be a distinction which I no longer see being advocated. It's not just a simple ""do masks work, yes or no?"" Rather, it's a question of ""which masks work and which don't?"" If nothing else is available, sure, you should use whatever you can get your hands on, but I feel the public should be continually reminded and informed on what to aim for and companies need to be helped to produce more of the right type of mask.",kwzws8,2021-01-20 07:00:36

"You might be sick of hearing that but it didn't make it less true.

As for me being delusional, well it's not me that is a member of QAnon or conducting criminal acts leading to others deaths.

Additionally, do some research because what she is saying has been proven false time and again. She's had other posts removed when she's encouraged people not to wear masks or socially distance. That is dangerously irresponsible because masks can reduce airborne contagions by up to 95%. Social distancing had been proven to reduce infection rates.

Currently, she has a petition against forced vaccinations which is being used to spread fear and uncertainty among members of the public who don't fully understand what is happening. The actual facts are that there is no forced vaccination. None. That petition is based on falsehoods and is only good for scaring people.

I don't expect you to suddenly move away from your antivax stance but if you want to wave that flag, then don't use someone who clearly isn't telling the truth as your flagbearer.

"The idea with reusable cloth masks isn't to give compete viral protection.  We are not (hopefully not) living in Covid wards.  They are not too protect US from Covid.

They are intended to prevent spittle and spray from flying out as we talk and breathe, closing off a major transmission vector.  These masks have been shown to greatly reduce the spread of the virus, but there is a reason you don't see medical staff using them in theatre.",kwzws8,2021-01-21 05:09:15
"First of all I have no idea what QAnon is, I don't watch MSM, and I don't follow politics or religion. And I really don't care what yours or anyone else's political or religious affiliations are. I care about the truth, no matter which side it's coming from. Secondly I'm sorry, my mistake for thinking the 'antivaxxers' sub was for anti-vaccine. My bad.
What are these doctors gaining by speaking out? What are these front line nurses gaining by speaking out? Losing their jobs, practices, mocked and ridiculed. What do you think their motives are? The state of Oregon pulled a doctor's license to practice because he gave his staff and patients the option to wear masks and didn't mandate them. Why? and spare your links on masks blah blah blah. I have some to counter, but you obviously don't care.
Hydroxychloroquine has been FDA approved for 65 years. And is over the counter in many countries including many African Nations. Africa being a third world country with no ICUs, no masks, no social distancing reporting death rates at 1% of the Western nations. She was fired from her hospital for treating her patients with the hydroxychloroquine. Not because they were concerned, but because the biggest payer at that hospital, an insurance company, didn't want her to use it. If it's working, then why? This kind of reminds me of when they made marijuana illegal because they were pushing for people to take aspirin, morphine, and other highly addictive opioids, which has worked out SUPER great. I can tell you the motives for big pharma and pfizer are money. Not your health. Why is it that the four major vaccine companies make 50 million a year selling vaccines and then 500 billion a year selling adderal, inhalers, albutral, diabetes meds, seizure meds, etc. why are we in an opioid crisis?
Fauci has stated the experimental vaccine, and I quote, ""will not stop transmission."" Why on earth would you take an experimental vaccine when the chance of you surviving is higher with NO TREATMENT. As the CDC states: if you are under the age of 20 and NO TREATMENT you have a 99.997% chance of survival. Age group 20-49 a 99.98% chance of survival with NO TREATMENT. Age group 50-69 a 99.97% and 70+ 99.95 chance of survival. They are approving, mandating in some places, these females at child bearing age to get these experimental vaccines not knowing the effects on the placenta. It is not a conspiracy. They don't know. That is insanity and makes absolutely no sense to me. But if it does to you, great. Have a good day.

Edit: third world countries in Africa",kwzws8,2021-01-14 19:05:19
"Well, your last post explains a lot. You have the opportunity to check on all these bizarre claims and you've not done that. So much for caring about the truth.

QAnon is a group formed after posts from a person or persons calling themselves Q. It is dedicated to a discredited conspiracy theory that claims that a cabal of Satan worshipping cannibal paedophiles that runs a global child sex trafficking ring is at war with Donald Trump because he is leading a secret war against them. It's no surprise that his political opponents are all named as leaders of this cabal.

You want to talk about things that don't make sense, try that.

QAnon advocates and uses violence in support of Donald Trump as was witnessed in the recent attacks on the Capitol, in which this doctor took part. If five people dying, including the murder of a police officer, isn't bad enough, the authorities found at least one vehicle with stashes of bombs. The stated intentions of the attack included hanging officials if they were opposed to Trump.

This is the person you have chosen to endorse.

As for Hydroxychloroquine, yes it has been FDA approved...for treating malaria. Studies have shown it is not effective for treating any virus and has a range off dangerous side effects.

It's a little odd that you advocate using a medicine worth known side effects instead of a vaccine that you claim might have side effects. Somehow that makes sense to you? As for the term experimental vaccine, it is not. That term was advocated by doctor Gold to be used as a propaganda tool and I see you've got on board. So much for caring about the truth.

As for some of your other claims, it's clear that either you are amazingly ignorant or endorsing lies. Africa is NOT a third world country. It is a continent that has many countries.

It is absolutely untrue that there are no ICUs, no masks, no social distancing and a one percent death rate compared to western nations. Everything you have claimed is one hundred percent false.

South Africa (a country) is currently in lockdown because new cases of COVID 19 are being found daily, currently over twenty five thousand new cases daily. They've had over 1.2 million known infections and nearly forty thousand deaths. South Africa is an advanced country with many hospitals, ICUs etc completely contrary to your claims, which you made with no supporting evidence.

I'm not going to keep pointing out the rest of the falsehoods because this is getting too long but everything you have claimed is untrue. 

You care about the truth? Not enough to actually post any truth it seems.",kwzws8,2021-01-14 22:46:42

There are facts and probabilities, they're not the same. What you posted was neither fact or probable as it was all demonstrably false.

"Not entirely true with the last statement. Nurses are treatment administrators not medical researchers. However, i do find it weird that a trained nurse would be completely anti vax. However, I understand why some are hesitant with the Covid-19 vaccine due to its short turn around where normal vaccines and medical treatments take years to verify. However, many of them forget Moderna have been working on the delivery system of MNRa for 10 years now. But yea, total anti vax with nurses is weird, but the covid vaccine caution is understandable.

Hey new person. It's a new type of vaccine that uses proteins rather than the new virus. I don't believe there is longterm science on it however I might be wrong. I personally don't believe this is a reason to not get vaccinated however it hasnt been researched. I would prefer the old type of vaccine because there is research on  weekend or dead virus.,kvlue2,2021-01-13 02:41:54
">Vaccines are not tested thoroughly.

There is no answer to this, different vaccines have been tested different amounts, whether it was tested sufficiently probably depends on the vaccine 

>Vaccines alter your DNA and contain poisons that your body, esp. the liver, tries its best to eliminate.

Where did the idea that they alter your DNA come from? And I don't think any of them have enough of any toxin to strain the liver, what chemicals specifically are they worried about?

>Viruses don’t exist and have never been observed.

This is just plain false

>Terrain theory \[greater than\] Germ theory.

Both exposure to germs and your bodies natural resistance (terrain) are important, and vaccines increase this natural resistance

>Masks are pointless/ineffective.

I don't know much of the science about masks but I thought studies had shown them to work

>The COVID-19 test is a trick for the government to collect our DNA.

This kind of speculation needs some evidence to back it up

>The COVID-19 death tolls are fake. Deaths from other causes are attributed to COVID-19.

It is hard to decide what to count the cause of death as is some cases, but deaths caused directly by covid have been clearly documented, and the total death rate from all causes has rises drastically during covid

>Scientists are controlled by the government and are forced to falsely report data. Don’t trust them.

Not all scientists and government officials can be trusted, true, but how does this mean vaccines are useless?

"I don't think that makes you an anti-vaxxer. It's one thing to say that all vaccines are poison (super anti-vaxx) and another thing to be wary about one brand new vaccine that just came out. Here's a relevant story:

My mom is not anti-vaxx by any means, and has never been anti-vaxx. At the time of this story, I had been completely vaccinated on schedule.

When I was 10, the new Gardasil (HPV) vaccine came out. I was at my pediatrician's office, and they were pushing my mom to give me the new vaccine really hard. At the time, I was dealing with epilepsy and constantly going from medication to medication to figure out which one would stop my seizures. These medications were causing all sorts of side effects along the way too. Because I was already dealing with this mess, my mom believed it would be too much for me to have a brand-new vaccine administered to me too and decided to wait (plus I was 10, I wasn't going to have sex anytime soon). They were so bad about pushing this vaccine that my mom ended up getting a new pediatrician for me.

I am now vaccinated against HPV, and my seizures are under control. I absolutely don't blame my mom for holding off on the vaccine. Wanting to be cautious with any kind of brand-new medical treatment is normal and sensible. That being said, because I am now in a good place in terms of seizure control and general health, I would have no problems receiving the COVID-19 vaccine whenever it becomes available to me.",kvuzwj,2021-01-13 18:14:27

"Totally agree with this. I personally think it’s sensible to wait if you are not in the “at risk” group. I’m not anti vaccination, but I am concerned about new technology that has no long term results (MRNA), and would prefer to wait for a traditional style of vaccine. I am someone who has also had to carry epipens around on my person, so people with undiagnosed allergies are being advised against having the vaccine at the moment anyway. In my mind Anti-vaxxers are people who won’t take any vaccine despite years of positive results. Wanting to wait a little longer to see what happens but being open to having the vaccine when you feel confident in it, is not the same as an anti-vaxxer. To me it just seems sensible. Don’t be afraid to make up your own mind about how you feel and think about things. If you don’t feel comfortable to have it right now, that’s all you need to know.

The most layman’s way of thinking about mRNA is picture it as a LEGO instruction book. Your cell will read it and begin building what it says to build. Once it has read the instructions it will tear up the book as it isn’t needed anymore because it built what it said to. 
What the book says to build is a protein that is the same as the one COVID has. Since this protein isn’t something normally found in the body it gets flagged and the immune systems goes to remove it. This is how we can get immunity from the virus.

"Unfortunately there is plenty of science calling the safety of these products into question.

Science does not support the proposition that these products are 100% necessary and safe, but in fact suggests they are the root of the epidemic of autism and auto immune disease we face in the US. Take a look at HBV.

Recent studies from a top Chinese university have shown a potential link between HBV vaccine given after birth and autism/neurological impairment. These are the first studies of their kind. This 2016 mice study shows significant neurological effects from just one round of the hep b vaccine:

“This work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and multiple sclerosis.”

This is testing ONE vaccine. Not the cumulative effect of the combined aluminum injected into children under the ever increasing modern vaccine schedule. A 2018 follow up study on the mechanics of this process found the following:

“These findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.”

Paul Patterson's research at Caltech supports the proposition that a vaccine induced immune activation event could lead to autism and other neurological dysfunction.

Hep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial that would uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it to every child born in America on the first day of life. However the vaccine has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles) until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.

There are zero long term safety studies of this vaccine.

To address the neurological safety of a product long term clinical trials and placebo based safety studies are relevant. Those have never been done with this product.

"“Universal hepatitis B vaccination was recommended for U.S. newborns in 1991; however, safety findings are mixed. The association between hepatitis B vaccination of male neonates and parental report of autism diagnosis was determined. This cross-sectional study used weighted probability samples obtained from National Health Interview Survey 1997-2002 data sets. Vaccination status was determined from the vaccination record. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds for autism diagnosis associated with neonatal hepatitis B vaccination among boys age 3-17 years, born before 1999, adjusted for race, maternal education, and two-parent household. Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life. Non-Hispanic white boys were 64% less likely to have autism diagnosis relative to nonwhite boys. Findings suggest that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine prior to 1999 (from vaccination record) had a threefold higher risk for parental report of autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated as neonates during that same time period. Nonwhite boys bore a greater risk”

HBV is not a deadly disease affecting children. HBV is an STD. Kids born to HBV negative mothers are extremely unlikely to come into contact with the disease. 95% HBV cases resolve without complications.

Autism is permanent and can be profoundly debilitating.

25-50% of autism cases are non verbal.

The CDC admitted in in federal court on March 20, 2020 that they rely on only 20 studies to make the claim there is no link between vaccines and autism.

NONE of those studies looks at HBV vaccine. The CDC has no science to support that statement. The only studies they have are on MMR vaccine with thimerisol adjuvant. That product is not even in use anymore, meaning they have no basis for the claim vaccines do not cause autism. Of those now useless MMR studies, ZERO use a placebo control group. Here is a link to the court filing listing all the studies.

https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stipulation-and-Order-Fully-Executed.pdf

How can they study one vaccine (poorly) and claim that ALL vaccines are safe when these products have completely different ingredients. None of the 20 studies involved an aluminum adjuvanted vaccine.

There are many recent studies calling into question the neurological safety of injected aluminum vaccine adjuvant and HBV vaccine.

Honestly there’s not enough information to even suggest that COVID will become a new Flu. In fact it’s likely it’ll be quite the opposite. If we take a look at the last SARS virus; it spontaneously just stopped spreading on its own after a couple years.,krc2ny,2021-01-07 07:29:15
"Well, even if it does not become the new flu, studies seem to suggest the vaccine/antibody is not a permanent thing, and it is not unlikely COVID will be here for at least 1\~2 more years.  


Which means new shots once the old one fades.  


Not to mention new shots for the new variants.",krc2ny,2021-01-07 08:39:36
"So, from what I’ve been listening to the good news is as follows, since COVID doesn’t have a global transmission mechanism beyond humans, once we get it under control with the vaccine it’ll significantly slow down its capabilities of reproducing and it’s ability to mutate in tern. 

Because this virus isn’t constantly being circulated globally via avians it will take years for new forms to develop if they do at all. However; that’s moot at this point because now that we’ve got a working mRNA vaccine, a new vaccine is just plug and play. 

You sequence the new spike then plug the changes in and make a new vaccine.",krc2ny,2021-01-07 08:45:03

"But the year isn't usually because of that being the time to test a vaccine. It's due to not being able to get funding to support each stage of the trial.

Most side effects of from a vaccine are apparent quite quickly. The amount of previous research on vaccines means we already have a lot of information that we didn't have when scientists were developing them from almost scratch.

Some of these vaccines have been in progress for a virus vaccine before covid-19 was discovered and were able to adapt the vaccine and such as soon as the sequence was released.

I'm not a scientist, but I do enjoy reading a lot of this and the only thing I think I'd be conferences about personally is pregnancy and vaccination.

You wait a year then another load of people are gonna die, maybe more as hospitals get overrun from faster spreading variants cross with people getting very complacent/non-compliant.

There have been the three stages of testing done. There are always rare side effects that may never be discovered until a national roll out but this isn't usually down to time but number of participants. If you haven't rolled a vaccine out to 4 million people then you may not discover the one in 4 million chance of a side effect. 

For example there was about 1 in 100,000 who additionally contracted GBS (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) from the 1976 swine flu vaccine. This was only noticed after it had been rolled out to more people.

However the statistics of those who would have died of swine flu out of the people vaccinated are much higher. It's not ideal but there is a risk to every medication people take, even the ibuprofen most people take quite regularly. 

If we wait a year the death toll will be high. World covid deaths are [reportedly](http://worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) at 1,851,997. It is likely to be higher as those are just the reported/confirmed.

Flu usually causes up to 650,000 global deaths a year.

Anyone who is willing should or vulnerable should get a vaccine if possible. Those who don't should definitely continue rules such as distancing and masks as they are still at risk of either carrying it asymptomatically or suffering the illness (and if not death then fatigue or long covid symptoms).",kq2y84,2021-01-04 09:49:42

"Exactly this. 

In the UK we had 2 bad reactions to the Pfizer Vaccine. As a result within 24hrs we immediately advised against anyone with serious allergies to anything to not take the Pfizer vaccine until some research had been done. A couple of weeks later and our vaccine authority have now narrowed down the constituents that caused the allergic reaction and have now rolled that information to doctors for their vaccine planning lists for patients. Both patients with the bad reactions recovered.

An additional problem with delaying mass vaccination is virus mutations. The more particles of virus out there means there’s more mutations happening day to day. Coronavirus as a whole doesn’t mutate as easy as other virus’s but still does daily with its prevalence worldwide. At present the UK has now a more contagious variant of the virus, which isn’t anymore deadly but spreads about 50% easier. In South Africa there’s a coronavirus variant that might be resistant to the vaccine or at least partially resistant. 

Waiting any period of time and allowing the virus to remain in such high numbers means there’s more chance for the virus to mutate and possibly create a vaccine resistant strain, that we wouldn’t be able to fight without another year of vaccine research.",kq2y84,2021-01-05 05:57:33

Science does not support the proposition that these products are 100% necessary and safe, but in fact suggests they are the root of the epidemic of autism and auto immune disease we face in the US. Take a look at HBV.

Recent studies from a top Chinese university have shown a potential link between HBV vaccine given after birth and autism/neurological impairment. These are the first studies of their kind. This 2016 mice study shows significant neurological effects from just one round of the hep b vaccine:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/

This well sourced paper explains the importance of animal studies in analyzing vaccine toxicity:

http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Animal-Studies.pdf

The 2016 mice study speaks for itself:

“This work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and multiple sclerosis.”

This is testing ONE vaccine. Not the cumulative effect of the combined aluminum injected into children under the ever increasing modern vaccine schedule. A 2018 follow up study on the mechanics of this process found the following:

“These findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.”

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29751176/

Paul Patterson's research at Caltech supports the proposition that a vaccine induced immune activation event could lead to autism and other neurological dysfunction.

http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4166/

Hep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial that would uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it to every child born in America on the first day of life. However the vaccine has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles) until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.

HBV is one vaccine we should probably take off the schedule. Not everyone asking for safer vaccines is ignorant or scientifically illiterate.

More information on HBV, AL, and autism:

⁠The US Austim rate is skyrocketing (most likely do to an environmental factor). https://health.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20090218_autism_environment/ ⁠The US vaccine schedule and resulting aluminum nanoparticle exposure is coincidentally skyrocketing at the same pace as autism. https://www.safeminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/aluminum-and-mercury-in-vaccines-through-2007-ayoub.pdf ⁠The relationship between aluminum vaccine adjuvant and autism rates has NEVER been properly studied. http://vaccinepapers.org/category/aluminum/ ⁠The relationship between the hep b vaccine and autism is likewise almost completely unstudied. Hep b is injected into most newborns in the US in their first hours of life. http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Neonatal-hepatitis-B-vaccination-impaired-the-behavior-and-neurogenesis-of-mice-transiently-in-early-adulthood..pdf ⁠Biological studies empirically show that aluminum adjuvants make their way to the brain in mammals. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302736 ⁠Recent mice studies out of China demonstrate a mechanism through which those adjuvants elicit an immune response, causing neurological damage upon reaching the brain. http://vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/Wang%20Yao%202018%20Cytokine%20IL-4%20Hep%20B%20Hippocampus.pdf ⁠There is no compelling reason to vaccinate infants for hepatitis b, especially in light of this emerging science, unless the mother is hep b positive. Developed countries that do not vaccinate for hep b, like Denmark, have better under 5 health outcomes. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.dyn.mort?view=map&year_high_desc=false compare with: http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/hepatitis-b

8) A recent UK study shows elevated aluminum levels in autistic brains, apparently from aluminum adjuvant transported there by the immune system. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763

Phamacuitical products should be thoroughly tested before  human consumption. Considering there is no compelling reason to vaccinate newborns for Hep B, if the mother is negative, we should probably pull it from the schedule at least until more animal studies give us additional insight into the role of aluminum nanoparticles in triggering an immune response/cytokines in the brain, leading to possible neurological damage.",kp4bd1,2021-01-03 06:21:19

"Please stop trying to link vaccines to autism. Autism is a developmental disability that starts on the day the brain develops in utero and seems to be almost entirely genetically determined [(here)](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20190717/autism-largely-caused-by-genetics-not-environment-study). In fact, they've narrowed it down to a bunch of genes that are the likely culprits [(here)](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-genetics-explained/). Autism is literally a fundamental difference in brain structure and how information is processed. Is it not damage. The brain has already grown and developed a different way. That does not magically happen after a vaccine, it just so happens that the milestones that are associated with certain expected developments happen to correspond to when childhood vaccines are received. Once again, autism is not brain damage.

Autism rates are not skyrocketing, autism DETECTION is much better now and is not mired in racial, gender, and class-based assumptions as previously has been. Many people are getting diagnosed as adults because they were never detected as children but the signs were always there. The criteria are broadening to include the same underlying developmental event while accounting for different ways that people are socialised.

I would also like to point out that your suggested that Denmark has better child health outcomes because they do not use the hep B vaccine on newborns. I would humbly suggest that this is due to the absolutely horrendous healthcare and poverty issues that the US has and refuses to resolve, especially as the rate of ASD diagnosis in Denmark is actually higher than the US statistic shown in your links ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21311963/#:\~:text=Overall%20ASD%20prevalence%20rates%20were,(21.8%20per%2010%2C000%20children](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21311963/#:~:text=Overall%20ASD%20prevalence%20rates%20were,(21.8%20per%2010%2C000%20children)). The lack of social care given to children and the sheer expense in seeking medical care, not to mention the notoriously unhealthy products on offer that are far cheaper than fresh fruit and vegetable, is a recipe for institutionalised child neglect for lower income households. The comparison is essentially meaningless.

I also noticed that you keep mentioning how certain things have never been studied as causal links and therefore we don't know if certain factors cause autism. But there are many sources of adjuvants that contain much more aluminium than a vaccine [(here)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm) and no one is calling for these to be investigated or banned. Using deodorants did not make me autistic. Drinking tap water did not make me autistic. I am not American, but I am autistic, and I was autistic before I had any kind of vaccine. People keep having to debunk this over and over because people aren't listening and keep holding this frankly disgusting view that being autistic is somehow worse than being dead or permanently affected by a very preventable disease. Trying to defend our existence is frankly tiring. We exist and people need to accept this because we have always existed, long before vaccines and long before the prejudice that devalues us to the point of being a fearmongering statistic to trot out in opposition to good science.

Thanks for reading.",kp4bd1,2021-01-03 20:15:53
"I'm not a scientist nor a doctor. I'd just like to point out that vaccines aren't our only source of aluminum exposure. It's found in our water, our deodorants, food and drink cans, cooking utensils, and fluoride. We can't say that its trace presence in vaccinations is responsible for autism and dementia without considering there are many more sources and higher exposure levels in our every day lives. To do so would be hysteria.",kp4bd1,2021-01-03 19:19:33
"Finally someone speaks the truth. So many uninformed zombies drinking the kool aid with their sheeplike comments. It’s exactly how the big plastic companies pulled one over our head by changing the narrative of plastic production into the public’s problem. Instead of producing less plastic they put it on the consumer to recycle. Turning us on each other whilst completely removing themselves and their record year over year plastic production out of the equation. Essentially recyclers speak out against non recyclers instead of focusing on the clear root of the problem. CONTINUOUS PLASTIC PRODUCTION. Same with vaccines. Big pharma has pulled a veil over the heads of many unsuspecting Americans. There is literally trillions of dollars at stake for them if they don’t fight the growing anti Vaccine movement. This isn’t about tracking devices and population control conspiracies. It’s about immuno response. Weakening our immune systems get us into big pharmas “system” or “database” from a very young age. We will become reliant on their meds as we grow older. Our bodies natural immunity will be compromised for good and they stand to benefit. In science class they had fetuses in a jar of formaldehyde that were 30 years old, in vaccines they have dead fetal tissue from an animal with the same. There is so much emphasis on “no preservatives” yet we inject our tiny children from 3 months old with a vile full of it. A preservative that can maintain human bodies for YEARS! It’s just one of many preservatives needed to inject the dead fetal tissue into their bodies, which, in turn weakens the child’s natural immune system from such a young age. This isn’t a conspiracy it’s just big business. And big business special interest groups with billions behind them usually win and in this case just like the plastic companies they’ve created “pro vaxxers” to go after those who choose not to put actual poison in their baby’s bodies. To disallow our children into school without it. To silence us without anyone realizing who the real culprits are. To stop us from finding better ways to create immunity maybe even dare I say, natural ways. Everyone’s so enamored by “organic” foods (to the point where every huge food conglomerate is finding a way to get this word on their package) and no one seems to think it’s abnormal to inject our 25 lb kids with these vaccines. Give it to me if they have to keep Sales and profits up. I weigh 150 lbs and I’m 41. I’d gladly take it in their stead Don’t make my little kids with developing immune systems take it. @epictetus1 we need more ppl like you trying to educate ppl. This isn’t a conspiracy just like us wanting to stop plastic production isn’t. They’re bad for our general health and there are alternatives if only the veil were lifted for more people to see. If only ppl would do their own research and see the hypocrisy. We’re so obsessed with ‘natural’ ‘organic’ ‘no preservatives’ no ARTIFICIAL ingredients yet you’re evil if you don’t want to put it in your infant. Completely backward with big business to silence those who Speak out. They’ve created a system where they cannot lose. 
Would love to hear civilized thoughts and comments. It’s a serious issue and everyone should have a right to choose.

"You are conflating the toxicity of water soluble environmental aluminum ingested in food (AL3+) with non water soluble aluminum salts like amorphous aluminum hydrophosphate sulphate (AlHO₉PS-₃) that are injected into the bloodstream as vaccine adjuvant. The body reacts to these chemically distinct compounds in different ways. Non water soluble aluminum salts are used as adjuvant because they incite a dramatic immune response. 

More info:
""Most studies of Al toxicity look only at water-soluble Al3+ (e.g. from Al lactate or Al chloride). Al exposure from food enters the body as Al3+ ions. The kidneys quickly remove this dissolved Al3+. Most of it is gone within 24 hours. Al adjuvants are different, because they do not dissolve. They are made of insoluble solid particles of Al hydroxide, Al phosphate or Al sulfate. Because of the low solubility, Al adjuvant remains in the body and is not filtered by the kidneys. Al adjuvant particles have been detected in humans over a decade after vaccination. It does dissolve very slowly however, releasing a trickle of Al3+ ions. These Al3+ ions do appear in blood, but the amount is so small as to be undetectable (compared to baseline, normal levels). The solid Al adjuvant particles do not appear in the blood. Al adjuvant particles from vaccines are phagocytosed (i.e. eaten) by macrophages, a type of immune system cell. Mostly, the Al adjuvant remains at the injection site, inside the macrophages. Macrophages rarely travel through the blood, but they do travel all over the body, mostly via the lymphatic system. As macrophages travel, they carry the Al adjuvant particles inside them. This macrophage transport process occurs slowly, over months or years. Consequently, at any given time, there is little Al adjuvant in transit. Macrophages travel to organs like the spleen, liver, stomach, kidneys, lymph nodes, and brain. Al adjuvant particles cause chronic inflammation and injury wherever they go.""

"None of those things are due to a viral pandemic, and actually I think you'll find we have bodies that control all those things. Medical staff answer to medical boards to minimise risk. You need a license to drive to minimise the risk. Restaurants need to answer to food safety regulations and hygiene inspections. And outside the US, people do wear masks when they are ill to protect people around them. Our whole lives are structured around minimising risk for both legal and quality of life reasons. This is one of those cases.

So we're talking about a specific situation here (COVID) that doesn't map to any of the examples you gave. A better example would be you insisting that people don't need mosquito nets in some regions because the percentage of people that die of malaria isn't that high.

Whataboutism isn't going to see you through this one. Boring is also preferable to irresponsibly infecting people with a life-changing and potentially life-threatening virus, and the pandemic would be over much sooner if people actually observed good practice.

"Seriously; without intentionally being mean, your understanding of the immune system is flawed. You don’t inherit antibodies of any kind from your parents; the only inferred immunity is via milk which contains antibodies. 

“Natural immunity” is also a stupid phrase. Your immunity from a natural infection could be worse and go away after some time but your immunity via a vaccine could be lifelong and permanent. 

Some diseases don’t even give your body a chance to create antibodies (rabies; tetanus; etc) before they ought right kill you or do permanent damage.",kojbuy,2021-01-07 07:43:00
"Do you mind to clarify your understanding of an “immune system”. 

What is it? If it is a “system”, what are the individual components working together? How does it work? Why does it work? What differentiates a strong immune system from a weak immune system?",kojbuy,2021-01-02 01:23:30
"OK, let's talk. I get your point but there is a problem.

Basically, you say that we should let nature do its thing because it always did and we survived.
That's fine. In an evolutionary context it worked, yes. But you probably underestimate the number of lives it needed to take. 
You are basically saying that you don't mind to lose, for example your brother (or whoever), to a disease because he was then obviously not naturally strong enough.
Being young and having a healthy lifestyle may help you against some diseases but it does not make you automatically immune against everything. There are sooooo many factors that influence the outcome of a disease.
Your argument with giving people that need a vaccine only makes sense if those people can still get a vaccine. There are people out there who cannot even take the vaccines due to their medical condition. They rely on herd immunity to minimize the risk of getting the disease.

Also, the mechanism of an infection and a vaccine (especially RNA vaccine) is quite similar. The major difference is that the pathogen actively destroys your body while you are fighting it. So, even if you survive quite easily, you might be severely damaged (even if you don't feel or see it from the outside) and so much more vulnerable to another infection. The vaccine would be like a training. A training that teaches your immune system how the intruder looks like, so it can kill it before it did too much damage. Nature doesn't care about being ""naturally"" or ""artificial"". Cells and their compounds do not think. If I water my flowers or the rain does not matter for the flower. It will use the water, no matter where it came from.
Of course, we don't know everything. And a vaccine could also be harmful to some (by e.g. Inducing an anaphylactic shock) but the probability is much much lower. And I think, if the vaccine would be for some reason harmful for your body than the actual pathogen would be harmful for you too, for sure.

Taking the vaccine or not is not only a choice for yourself. It is a choice that you also make for others. Sure, we could always let nature do its thing. And maybe it would be better sometimes. But then we  should not help any people that could not live alone once they are adults? Should we not use anything that is far from being naturally but helps us live like we do today?",kojbuy,2021-01-02 10:13:37
"Ok, so I just wanted to let you know that a vaccination is a natural process. The vaccine contains a 'fake' version of the virus, that your body will fight off easily. The way immunity occurs is when a virus wakes up memory cells in your body, these cells will store information about the virus and when the virus comes back, they can coordinate a successful attack on it. This defense is so good that you might not ever get that virus ever again. However, the flu is a rapidly mutating virus that requires re-doses in order to keep memory cells informed. It's better to get a vaccine rather than exposure because the vaccine makes you just as immune, without you needing to get sick in the process. Plus, after a fight with a virus, the immune system will often be hurt during the battle, leaving a window for other viral infections while your immune system is still recovering. And why would you want to get sick when you could just take a tiny poke with a needle? It's still natural! And a good immunity isn't made by diet, it's from experience during battles. Now, I ain't no doctor, but I've done plenty of research, and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEE THIS VIDEO!

"tldr; you sound like you're in favor of darwin's survival of the fittest.
the simple explanation as to why people vaccinate boils down to trying to make your body stronger, just like taking vitamins, working out, or eating healthy.

I'd say a strong immune system has a higher regulation of the many operatives that keep one healthy or alive. A weak immune system is one whereby what keeps one healthy is not being circulated in high quantities.,kojbuy,2021-01-02 12:41:24
"I think you make some extremely valid arguments. I agree with you in many ways but have counter points. Thank you also for being open to discussion. I figured that no one would reply to this since it was taking so long to get any response. 

Okay so I'll try to answer this as efficiently as possible. 

1. In an evolutionary context it worked. 
Yes it did, and it does, and it still works and we should not disrupt that. 
2. Death toll underestimation. 
Yes, it's easy to underestimate the death toll, but in all cases the death toll will always be older people with weaker immune systems. The outliers will be people who have bad hygiene, weak genetics or stressful living circumstances. So the death toll will typically be those who were weak anyway. 
3. Automically immune. 
Yes, no matter how you live, you will never be automatically immune. It's not about immunity, it's about conditioning. One must condition their immune system to fight against viruses until the immune system becomes effecient at this process. The process I think is over simplified, fighting a virus is not only detection which plays a big role. It's also the fight. A weak immune system cannot fight, a strong immune system can fight really well and keep the body going whilst the anti bodies learn the behaviour patterns of the virus. 
4. People with health conditions who rely on herd immunity. 
These people have it rough! They were born with genetics that did not favour them in the experience of survival and thrival. The herd should be immune to a great degree anyway if they all have good immune systems, however herd immunity is not enough. In nature you must be strong because viruses are small fuckers who fit through tiny gaps. A virus is a master of following air currents to its next target. Relying on others does not help you in nature. You must be strong on your own so you can be strong as a group. 
5. Viruses damaging your body whilst you are fighting them making you vulnerable to further experiences, vaccines giving the ability to allow antibodies to locate and delete quickly before damage occurs. 
Indeed, however it is the fight that conditions you! If I fight a human in a ring, that is different to fighting a punching bag in a gym. There is a sharp difference between a living virus and a dead one. Conditioning your body to survive against viruses is extremely important, your body must be able to adapt and remain strong even if a virus is swimming through you, and you must give your body the opportunity to learn to detect a virus whilst it's alive not when it's dead. This is valuable training data in comparison to the training data you get when you just take a vaccine. If I condition my body to detect dead or weakened viruses, after 1000's of years, my body will become an adept at detecting dead/weakened, not alive ones! Alive viruses are different to dead and weakened ones. This is because alive viruses can do shit that dead viruses cannot. Viruses mutate and adapt, they will eventually learn that the human body can only detect dead weakened shit due to 1000's of years of conditioning, and so the virus will, over the course of a looooong time, adapt to be able to bypass those conditioned detection procedures which are specified to dead or weak organisms. 
Battle scars are a part of the war my friend! 
6. Nature doesn't care between natural or artifical because it doesn't think. 
Yes, 100 true. Nature doesn't think, nature does not reason, nature does not logically conclude. But that does not mean nature is not *intelligent*. Whilst nature cannot reason and think, it is intelligent in its own way that we still do not understand because humans we humans are still neophytes in our understanding of nature. Nature does care, it just cares in a way we are still learning to comprehend. What Nature cares about is completely different to what humans care about. Humans care about thoughts, nature cares about, well... Something? Who knows what. But one things for sure, it is that whatever nature cared so much about is why we exist in the first place. 

To your final point, no. We should never use unnatural things to help us live. Unnatural things make us weak in most if not all circumstances, however, natural ways keep us strong. The strong do not need vaccines, only the weak need vaccines. If the weak are desperate to live because they have family that they love and want to live along side of, it is their choice to use technology to keep them alive. However, it is our irrational fear of death that causes us to not allow nature to run its organic course. People die, this is how nature intended life to be. Whether that happens because of a virus should not matter. Disrupting nature is a terrible thing to do. The consequences are unforseen until they manifest. Living alongside nature is how a civilization remains mighty and genetically superior. This does not mean you become a cave man, it means instead that you let the stresses of your environment shape you, at most, nature will stress you out with an illness, or an earth quake, or a weather abnormality, or a volcanic spurt, or finally a survival of the fittest situation. Rather than using a vaccine, we must teach our physiology to deal with these situations. 

Thank you for your detailed response, I'm looking forward to your counter arguments. Thanks for being willing to talk.",kojbuy,2021-01-02 14:40:34
"Hello my friend, let's debate! Looking forward to your counter arguments. Let's keep it civil but it can be as heated as you want.

1. No vaccinations are a completely unnatural process. The body easily fights off the altered version of the virus, this is infact the biggest issue. The immune system is not fully understood by medical science because the human physiology is extremely complicated not just at a cellular level, but at those super small levels that the human eye/microscope cannot pick up. The immune system at a simple level does as you described, it remembers viri, but that is not only what the immune system functions to do. The immune system is like a machine learning operation, AI I mean, I'm sure you know what AI is. The struggle with AI is that it is not intelligent enough to, say, learn Chess and then transfer those learnings skills to another game like Checkers. Same with our immune system, unless you condition and teach your immune system to deal with viruses *fully*, it will not learn how to operate without medical intervention. Conditioning your immune system by having it deal with viruses and infections organically without vaccines is the best way for it to learn to detect new kinds of viruses. Viruses are alive! And what is alive is complicated, because things that are alive can fool your immune system, vaccines are either severely weakened viruses, dead viruses, or altered viruses, these viruses are not alive in any real context however, so they are missing the x factor that serves as the perfect teaching environment for your immune system to work with. Alive viruses once again can do things that vaccine viruses simply cannot, and can fool your immune system! It is your immune systems job not only to *remember* but to *learn* how to search and delete those pesky intruders who are doing a brilliant job at avoiding detection. It is the learning process that gets completely skipped when you rely on vaccinations. During that learning process you will be ill and you will exhibit symptoms of said illness. Another part of conditioning your immune system and body is learning how to be good at being ill! Being ill is annoying if anything, but one must learn to endure illness so that they can give their immune system enough time to search, learn, and delete the virus. These are vital skills that will be passed on to next generations over the course of thousands of years, but these positive genetics can only be attained by allowing the body to organically deal with viruses by not taking vaccines.
2. The flu is rapidly mutating, but redosing on a flu shot is the exact opposite to what you should do... The learning process of allowing yourself to contract the flu, conditions your immune system over many flu experiences to learn how the flu mutates. This is exactly the same way an AI can learn how to transfer chess skills to checkers, the immune system can use previous data to detect similar patterns and fight off the flu much more effeciently than before. When the immune system is weakened after a hard day at the office, the likelihood you will get another illness is extremely low! You only got ill because the immune system had to deal with something mutated, you will not get ill again unless a new mutated organism floats into your blood stream, but the likelihood that will happen is extremely low since you already just dealt with the mutated version. Teaching your immune system how to recover from just having fought off a virus is vital training for the immune system. You are conditoning your immune system just like you condition your muscles for your next work out.
The exact reason to get sick is so that you condition your immune system to outsmart all reoccurring viruses. It's organic and natural to get sick. It's completely inorganic and unnatural to get poked with a needle and injected with a lab altered organic material. You must condition your body into having a strong immune system, taking vaccines works at the memory level, getting naturally ill works at an incredibly holistic level. If medical science had full understanding of this, they would not endorse vaccines, and would only suggest that weak immune systems should take vaccines and strong immune systems should totally avoid them.
A good immune system is made by maaannnnyyyy things, not just battles from natural experience (without vaccines), but also from eating well, drinking well, exposure to your natural environment, being relaxed and unstressed, being hygienic and having good mental health. All of these make a wonderful immune system. Vaccines should only be given to the weak who have compromised immune systems, not those who have strong and healthy immune systems. Typically people who are immunocompromised are old people, unhealthy people (no surprise), or genetically faulty people (unfortunately, but that is more of a nature vs nurture thing).

"Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you are basically stating that people with weak/compromised immune systems just “have it rough” and “need to be strong.” Do you understand strength has nothing to do with it? No matter how healthy someone is, how many vitamins they take, etc...if their immune system is weak a virus will take longer to fight off and most of the time need medical intervention. How does herd immunity not help those with weakened immune systems? Surrounding oneself with vaccinated individuals is much safer for an immunocompromised person that that person just going out, no mask, exposing themselves to everything. And this is just not with COVID, flu season is tough for the immunocompromised. When viruses are going around in a community, the immunocompromised have to be more careful. To the ones who have weakened immune systems, not much changed day to day besides wearing a mask. They constantly have to look out for themselves and stay clean and away from sick people because people are not considerate enough to stay away from others when sick. They have to be careful with what kind of jobs they choose (ie an ER or clinic nurse is not ideal). There’s not really a “choice” in the matter. Just saying “don’t be stressed, be strong!” is not an easy task. Especially for those who suffer with anxiety, depression, etc. It’s more than just a lifestyle choice, it is a life or death situation.",kojbuy,2021-01-03 03:39:18

"Dude, teach me everything! I wanna learn more of course. Yes those two sentenced are essentially my understanding in the most simplified way possible. I believe the immune system is not fully understood in its more subtle aspects. I think being fully pro vaccine means that one does not fully understand the immune system at a very subtle level that I think science has not yet explored or fully understood.

To me, the immune system is something likened to a hive mind, it is like search and delete. The effectiveness of the operation is dependent of course on how one's genetics have mutated and adapted/evolved over time since everything ultimately comes from DNA. A vaccine I believe takes a way from the quality of adaptation, that the immune system needs to adjust to new environmental circumstances. I believe that nature has a way, we should never disrupt natures way. If we do then it will reek consequences for the future of humans. I think vaccines should only be used on the weak, the strong should not take vaccines and should instead deal with the hits that come with the immune system doing its most important job.",kojbuy,2021-01-02 14:46:45
"Hi there, thanks for replying. I'll also try to reply as best as possible.

1. No I'm not saying people with compromised immune systems have it rough and need to be strong.
Instead, I am defining strength as superior genetics in terms of one having a superior immune system to another because their generics are better. Equally strong as in someone who is healthy through and through. So in my definition, strength actually has *everything to do with it* because if you are strong generically and strong circumstantially (nature vs nurture) you will be able to deal with most if not all viruses without the need of a vaccine.
Being healthy and strong has nothing to do with vitamins, I personally have never taken a vitamin in my life and I only get ill once per year. Being healthy and strong means to be genetically competent, hygienic, unstressed and relaxed, and cognizant of the bodies organic needs (good food, non carbonated drinks, water).
2. Medical intervention is not neccesary for those with good immune systems, only those with weak immune systems. The weak should be the only people who use medical intervention, the strong as described above should fight off the vaccine normally to condition their body. It's good to keep the body working hard to survive so it can be conditioned against its natural environment. This allows favorable genes to be passed on. Taking pills and medical concoctions causes the body to become lethargic and causes genes to become lethargic. After 1000's of years of lethargy, you will create a specie that is entirely dependent on pills and  medical concoctions just to go to the shop.
3. To your last point about the immunocompromised having it rough. Yep that is exactly right, they have to do *all* of those things due to either them being old, or having a genetic defect during their early development. I feel sorry for them, I think they should be the ones to take the vaccine. They simply have it rough, and have had it rough from the get go, and they have to do all of those things to simply stay healthy that you had said. Herd immunity is quite useless because germs and viruses alike spread like wild fire. Even if everyone is vaccinated, that doesn't mean the virus hasn't multiplied and is looking for new targets.
And finally, yes nature has made it so that life and death are not optional. Living a life means you must accept the inevitable occurrence of death. If that means dying to covid in the coming years, this is unfortunately the reality. People have depression and anxiety, true! People's living situation does not help, true! But guess what, this is the reality of what the world is moving to, being able to live a stress free life is becoming impossible because of how much humans have completely disrupted the natural progression of things. This is why people are depressed and anxious, because they live in a horrible society, so they become weak genetically over the course of generations until they become dependent on medical intervention to support them. It's an awful cycle. And this cycle cannot be repaired by medical intervention, it can only be repaired by humans weening themselves completely off medical intervention.",kojbuy,2021-01-03 12:11:07

Well, thats kinda philosophical now. Then you could argue also that it was nature's why how we humans developed and it is in her will that we are able to create such advanced technologies.

***Herd immunity is quite useless because germs and viruses alike spread like wild fire. Even if everyone is vaccinated, that doesn't mean the virus hasn't multiplied and is looking for new targets.***

That is just wrong. For a pathogen to spread it needs first to be able to infect you. Then it has to multiply and after that it has to be passed in sufficient amounts to another person. Being vaccinated fastens the detection of the pathogen, therefore eliminating it before it can multiply itself enough and leave your body. So herd immunity significantly reduces the probability for a pathogen to spread.

***Medical intervention is not neccesary for those with good immune systems, only those with weak immune systems.*** 

If I understood you correctly, for you a good immune system is based on good genetics. However, genes that give you advantages over pathogens X could make you more vulnerable against Pathogen Y. Therefore, a healthy person with an overall good immune system might still need medical intervention if it has to take a fight against the wrong enemy

***Living a life means you must accept the inevitable occurrence of death. If that means dying to covid in the coming years, this is unfortunately the reality. People have depression and anxiety, true! People's living situation does not help, true!*** 

Accepting death does not mean to risk your life in every possible way. I also doubt that you would gladly embrace death when you are still young if death could be preventable. I also doubt that you would risk your children's life for nothing.

***But guess what, this is the reality of what the world is moving to, being able to live a stress free life is becoming impossible because of how much humans have completely disrupted the natural progression of things.*** 

I agree that getting closer to nature would benefit a lot the mental and physiological health. However, it does not mean that everything that does not come from nature directly is bad.

***Being healthy and strong has nothing to do with vitamins, I personally have never taken a vitamin in my life and I only get ill once per year. Being healthy and strong means to be genetically competent, hygienic, unstressed and relaxed, and cognizant of the bodies organic needs (good food, non carbonated drinks, water).*** 

You take in vitamins or pre-products of vitamins automatically in by food and drinks. So if you have a healthy (food) lifestyle and no medical conditions you'll have enough vitamins in your body. Also, vitamins play a role for the immune system.  


Vaccines are not replacing the immune system. Vaccines show how the threat looks like. The immune system has to fight anyway. Vaccinated or not. However, with a vaccine you reduce the receiving damage. Pathogens are not infecting you to just fight your body. They are attacking other cell types too, leading to irreparable  damage if your body cannot fight off the pathogen fast enough. A recent study has for example shown that measles basically delete the ""memory"" of your immune system, making you vulnerable again against pathogens that you were immune to. 

Your thoughts are based on the assumption that during a fight without a vaccination, your immune system will ""learn"" something that makes it stronger.  It's like recruiting an army, not train them, and then send them to war, hoping that they will get ideas and knowledge during the fight that would be beneficial to fight superior aliens that may eventually come to earth. While risking to get your your whole army and country getting destroyed.  
Also, the genes that you pass are beneficial for your environment. So, getting genes that prevent coronaviruses from infecting you because your bloodline had to fight them often. Those genes could make you more vulnerable to other diseases in other countries/continents.

So you would risk a lot without knowing that there is some benefitial outcome after generations of generations. However, you, for sure wouldn't benefit since your genetics won't change simply. I would say it's a bad cost-benefits ratio.

"Thank you for detailed reply, lets go through your points. I'll let you know if I agree, disagree and what not.

1. Natural question, id say nature had two intentions for technology, 1. Making it easy to eat, have a shelter, keep warm and get from one place to another as well as off planet when our planet begins to die. None of that has anything to do with health and vaccines though, humans should be naturally healthy.
2. Can't disagree, completely valid argument. I'd only say that if the herd was naturally strong in their immune systems, vaccines would ever still be very unnecessary. I do also think that herd immunity is not a totally viable strategy however. I have a suspicion that due to the sheer number of viral organisms floating about in the air at any given time, relying on the herd to killem all off before you get ill is probably not the best idea. 
3. Interesting, the more you know. I think the fight should happen organically without the intervention of a vaccine so that the individual can adapt in a more balanced way if they do have a good immune system that can handle the blows, this will spell well I believe for future generations in terms of general immunity over the course of time. I'm also subscribed to the idea that whilst immunity at a genetic level plays a massive part, there are many factors that contribute to having a good immune system such as, non stressful living, being relaxed, good mental health, healthy eating habits, etc, if all these ideals are in check, illness will be a thing of the past and vaccines will be completely unnecessary, if we lived in a very healthy society, vaccines wouldn't exist because our immune systems would be able to handle many of the reoccurring viruses that pop up. Nature in its viri can only mutate to such and such a degree.
4. Of course, but is a vaccine neccesary if one is healthy? I think not. If I have healthy children I will not have to vaccinate them, there is no threat of death. If my children are immunocompromised, I don't have a choice, I have to vaccinate them. No one wants to die young, but people die young. Kobe Bryant for example. It happens. Death is inevitable, you do have to accept it whether you are young or old. People risk their lives all the time also. Sometimes you have to, such is life. If I'm healthy and I risk my life in getting covid, and I get covid, there is an incredibly low chance I'll die. If someone has a bad immune system, the chances of death are higher but only if their symptoms are just absolutely diabolical! You have to be realistic I think.
5. I agree to a degree, but a also disagree a lot as well. Most inorganic technology nowadays is bad. Humans ought to live by nature, in nature, with nature. Technology at most should make argicultre extremely easy, should make living in a shelter comfortable and pleasant in regards to heat most especially, should make water and light easily accessible, and should allow humans to get off the planet when the earth starts to die due to it coming to the end of its goldilocks cycle. It should not be used for the many consumerism things it is being used for now, this is an abuse of nature and is visible in how unhappy people are. The mere fact that we have to take anti depressant pills is embarrassing at a general level because this means we have strayed far away from our roots. 
6.1 Yep, I missed that about vitamins, thanks for correcting me. 
6.2 This is interesting, thanks for this information. I do have a slight thing to add let me know what you think. A vaccine shows the immune systemwhat the threat looks like, it was my understanding on reading about vaccines, that the whole point of a vaccine is that you don't get ill, and that the virus is severely weakened or even dead, and that the immune system kills it off easily and seeps that into its memory cells for the future if those pathogens come again. 
6.3 I disagree, let me know your thoughts, I think your army is trained due to prior run ins with foreign visitors, there is no better place to learn to battle than in field. You learn the basics at army camp which your immune system already knows genetically, the practice is on the field itself. Nothing beats the real life experience, that does mean getting infected, that does mean battle scars, but it always benefits your immune system to fight the alive version of the virus than the dead, I believe your immune system learns better specifically against something alive, than something injured and dead. In the case of measles, the human body would have to organically learn through adaptation to counteract the technique that the measle virus uses to fool the immune system, but for that to have happened, measles would have to be extremely common, in regards to common flus and viruses the body can handle, I think we should allow our bodies to deal with them naturally without resorting to vaccines due to the ""learning"" assumption I have invested in believing in. This is how we evolve I think. Let me know if I'm wrong. 
6.4 Interesting, I have a question. Do we not have a plentitude of valent gene sequences available for potential use to allow our evolution to continue without the side effect of being lopsided? I personally think so, if you disagree I'd be very interested in your reason why. 
6.5 Hmm, there is not nearly as much risk as you are thinking. Dying from a virus like the flu or covid typically happens to those whom are much older, or are immunocompromised due to nature/nuture, this means that those whom die from covid die because they had issues in the first place that the healthy population did not. I doubt the risk reward ratio is what you think. Looking at things realistically, if the healthy portion of humans can handle covid without a vaccine, not using the vaccine should be done so that the immune system can develop a holistic understanding of the virus. However, you are also sadly correct because the healthy portion of humans nowadays is becoming uncanningly low due to how we have abused nature. I'd be interested in your response. 
6.6 I think most humans live in an way that by 23245 generations, we will either have died off naturally, or we would be dead inside on many levels due to our complete abuse and reliance on technology as a whole. Whether the use of chemicals for health and mental health, whether the continual use of vaccines at a growing level, what technology we use to replace nature's organic way, will be our absolute downfall. 

Now I must say, your response was wonderful to read. You've changed my opinion on herd immunity, you are challenging my understanding of vaccines which is what I was looking for out of this, Thank you. I still for the most part think vaccines are 10% good 90% useless.

"As I said, the vaccine does not replace the immune system. It just minimizing the damage by letting the immune system know what it should look for. The pathogen will still be able to infect your body and cells. But since the immune system already knows how it looks like, it can react faster. 

I am not sure about your knowledge about the immune system. But I assume that immunology is not your profession. 

There is an argument that you use which does not make much sense in a logical way. You are saying that the immune system is complex and we dont know everything (which is true). But the people who worked and work with that know quite a lot and the evidence is very much that Pathogens can cause a lot of damage even if you are overall healthy (which varies between Pathogens of course) and that it is safer to take a vaccine. It might be true that the covid-19 would probably not kill you. But I doubt that, no matter how healthy and genetically fine you are, you could easily fight off something Ebola or HIV and being after a while as fine as you were before. 

So far (at least to my knowledge) there is no evidence that vaccines would somehow weaken our immune system over generations. 

&#x200B;

You cant say that vaccines are probably unnecessary because we dont know everything about the immune system, while the evidence so far supports strongly the use of vaccines. Just because vaccines are man made and not directly from nature (even though the compounds are). That is just irrational.

"It's insane that you think that. I'm just pointing out how I could pick out hundreds of people who reply just like you, and make the same kind of statements like you. I've dealt with people like you ever since I got on this website. Your just the same as most redditors. Hard-core science believers, people who don't question the validity of mainstream understanding and people who when someone disagrees with your religion, start flaming them and throwing some baby tantrum hissy fits. I expect courtesy in all my discussions! You can't give me that? Well then, time to move on. Vaccines being refuted is the entire thing you think is ""a bunch of hippie spiritual idiots who don't know anything about life."" People who write replies like you lump us all into the same group in the way I am lumping you into the ""I am a Typical Redditor"" group. In the same way you stereotype me, I stereotype you.

I'm still down to debate, I make my points, you make yours, if your logic is solid, you win, i accept defeat ""humbly"", if my logic is solid, fair game, guess I win. You wanna talk about vaccines, let's go. Whenever your ready to stop throwing an emotional tantrum let me know.

I am 90% for vaccines, 10% against.
I've been corrected by a Redditor here in my lack of understanding in herd immunity, I am also learning from that same Redditor about gene specialization.
I believe vaccines are not neccesary for a civilization if that civilization is healthy. I think vaccines should only be given to the immuno compromised. Prove me wrong if I am such a idiot. Refute me if your scientific understanding is as righteous as your response.

It is responses like yours that piss me off the most, but come on. You want a debate? Let's fucking get on with it rather than wasting our times having an emotional battle like immature children. I am not here to be a child and be an emotional and  say ""Your a this and your a that because you believe this and I believe that"" I left that behind due a long time ago.",kojbuy,2021-01-04 19:03:16
"1. Thanks for clarifying
2. Definitely not, but I am learning a lot from you, appreciate your replies.
3. Yh, I see the lack of logic in my argument as you have pointed it out. It's true what you say about extreme viruses like HIV, if a vaccine came out for HIV that would be a big deal. I think for less seriouses viruses like the flu, vaccines are not neccesary at all for healthy people. But I 100 agree with you that a vaccine is pivotol for extremely lethal viruses/pathogens. Vaccines will always be safer short term, I agree with you in that context but only in short term which of course there is no proof for yet.
4. There is no evidence, it is a hypothesis, I think it is true, but I may be totally wrong. But I am pretty certain that long term vaccine usage will weaken the immune system. Just a hypothesis based off certain logical factors. I base it on the idea that what you don't use you lose. For example, if in 500 generations, humans did not use their hands once and only used their feet, our hands would look different and lose many of their functions. Similarly, I think vaccines when used as a crutch for all illnesses will cause a degree of lethargy in how the immune systems operates. I am most interested in your perspective. If you disagree because there is a lack of logic in this argument and you can say otherwise, then I am willing to go 100% pro vaccine right now and close this thread. 
5. I would say its not totally irrational in actuality, and this may be where we mainly disagree. Nature didn't create vaccines, humans did. Humans created vaccines because we figured they are a better solution to illness. I think you have changed my opinion on this in context to serious pathogens like HIV, I can now say that yh, I totally agree with you, vaccines are extremely useful for viruses like this. So I'll clarify that I believe vaccines are not good when used to fight viruses like the flu and even covid for that matter. My disagreement toward vaccines only stretches as far as non fatal illnesses such as the flu most especially in that humans should naturally condition themselves again the flu and things like covid. I would consider covid to not be totally fatal either. Seemingly people are dying left right and centre from covid19, I think the deaths were inevitably going to happen.

Stuck on ventilators for weeks on end. It’s very terrible and it doesn’t seem to matter age or pre existing conditions. I got my first vaccine about 10days ago because I just decided to pretty much get it over with and stop worrying about whether to get it or not. I didn’t have any negative effects.

Absolute balderash to claim Shia muslims believe this

A couple of days ago, Ayatullah Sistani , who is currently the authority with the highest authority in Shia Islam declared that [Vaccination against COVID-19 was mandatory for muslims](https://the-14.com/grand-ayatollah-sayed-ali-al-sistani-replied-to-questions-about-the-coronavirus-vaccine/). That you absolutely must get it when it legally becomes available to you. This is the man who raised an army (the PMU) to fight ISIS with single command. 

Not only that the authority with the 2nd highest following in Shia Islam, Ayatullah Khamenei, the leader of Iran, has okayed the import of the COVID vacvime and under his orders [Iran is currently trying to develop it's own COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-begins-human-trials-of-homegrown-covid-19-vaccine/2091943) 

And regarding the Mark of the Beast, Shia Islam has a very different view of what the Beast of The Earth is and what it's Mark is.

>[Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali) said in a sermon about the signs leading towards the day of resurrection;

>*“Daabbatul Arz (The Beast of the Earth) will emerge from Mt. Safa. He shall be having the seal ring of Prophet Sulaiman (a.s.). When that ring would be touched on the face of a believer, it would brand him to be a true believer. And when it is touched on the face of an infidel it would clearly mark that he is really a disbeliever. So much so that the believer will say to the infidel, “Hell is ordained for you, O infidel.” And the disbeliever will say to the believer, “Tooba is ordained for you, O believer. Alas! If I were also successful and delighted with you this day.”*

>*Thus when the Daabba raises his head he would, by the permission of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime be able to see whatever is present between the east and the west. And it would be at a time when the Sun will rise from the west.* ***At that time the time for repentance would be over and no repentance would be accepted from anyone. Neither would any deed rise up to the heavens as mentioned:…its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith…”***

"I'll leave this summary here to inform others who may come across this post:

**Aluminium**

Aluminium serves as an adjuvant in vaccines - a wake up call to the immune system to induce a strong response. ""US Code of Federal Regulations recommends that the amount of Al permitted in a single unit human dose of vaccine should not exceed 0.85 mg of Al3+ per dose (...)."" \[10\]

Many seem to think our food is not 'contaminated' by heavy metals. This is completely false. An **average human intakes 10mg of aluminium just in food every day**. In case of drug administration, the normal average intake may reach 50-1000 mg/day, which far exceeds the maximum allowed dose of vaccines. \[11\]

Some evidence points out that aluminium injections can have nasty effects on the nervous system and may be linked to autoimmunity. Yet, despite this, aluminium adjuvants are still widely considered as safe by experts.

"They're salts instead of an oxide like most nanoparticles (The only examples I can find of a nanoparticle that isn't an oxide is silver and iron, though the former often exists as largely oxides.) When salts dissolve they're much smaller than nanoparticles, usually around a tenth of the size because the ions separate.

"Two types of aluminium adjuvant are mostly used, aluminium oxyhydroxide and aluminium hydroxyphosphate. 

The aluminium adjuvant consists of aggregated nanoparticles and once inside the phagosome an equilibrium will be established between various levels of aggregated nanoparticles and of soluble Al3+ ions. 

Maturation into a phagolysosome will change the protein and peptide content inside the vesicle and due to oxidative burst, change the redox potential in the vesicle. The pH will also drop, reflecting an increase of the H+ concentration by several orders of magnitude. 

The Al3+ concentration will rise since a decrease in pH increases the solubility of the aluminium salts used as adjuvants. 

Nanoparticles of aluminium adjuvants are more potent adjuvants than their corresponding microparticles and treatment with nanoparticles of aluminium adjuvants establishes a higher intracellular aluminium content.

Conclusion:

**Side effects such as ASIA caused by aluminium adjuvants have raised concerns on the use of aluminium salts as adjuvants in vaccine formulations and a chronic inflammation induced by a constant intracellular concentration of Al3+ ions could be the core of the autoimmune related side effect observed. By lowering the amounts of aluminium adjuvants in the vaccine formulation, an efficient immune response may still be achieved, however, the amounts of aluminium adjuvants persisting intracellularly will be reduced and thus mitigate the induction of a chronic inflammation and the occurrence of adverse reactions.**",km2j1k,2020-12-30 12:39:19

If you look at some of the preservatives in vaccines you’ll see aluminum and thimerisol which is mercury.

"This is my default comment in regards to sharing why, in part,  I'm against authoritarian-vaxxers: I'm in the process of learning more on this issue, and from what I've found there are a number of problems which the vaccination program faces. The following is by no means exhaustive but a start:

First of all: “Vaccination does [not](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1542/peds.106.6.1307) account for the impressive declines in mortality seen in the first half of the century… Nearly 90% of the decline in infectious disease mortality among US children occurred before 1940, when few antibiotics or vaccines were available.”

In addition, vaccines are found to have dangerous [contamination](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fmedcraveonline.com%2FIJVV%2FIJVV-04-00072.pdf&atb=v214-4se&t=ddg_android).

Next there's the [Office of Inspector General report](http://www.oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-07-00260.pdf) that found the CDC is Lax in Policing Advisors’ Conflicts of Interest, and this report by the Committee on Government Reform, entitled [Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine Policy Making](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fvaccinesafetycommission.org%2Fpdfs%2FConflicts-Govt-Reform.pdf).

There's also the genetic component in vaccine effectiveness and failure [Twin studies of immunogenicity—determining the genetic contribution to vaccine failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X00004680). 

Moreover, vaccines don't induce a great herd immunity, because even in highly vaccinated populations outbreaks occur, see [Measles outbreak in a vaccinated school population: epidemiology, chains of transmission and the role of vaccine failures.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646939/), 
""An outbreak of measles occurred in a high school with a documented vaccination level of 98 per cent.""

[Aluminum Vaccine Adjuvants: Are They Safe?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21568886/) - Abstract: ""Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences.""

There's also the mitochondrial dysfunction susceptibility in a subset of the population which may be at an increased risk of triggering autism spectrum disorder symtoms via immunization [Mitochondrial dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Mitochondrial+Dysfunction+in+Autism+Spectrum+Disorders%3A+A+Systematic+Review+and+Meta-Analysis&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DXDDpS1mmJkQJ); DA Rossignol, RE Frye; & [Developmental regression and mitochondrial dysfunction in a child with autism](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Developmental+Regression+and+Mitochondrial+Dysfunction+in+a+Child+With+Autism&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DdONEsMBjhWQJ); Jon S Poling, Richard E Frye, John Shoffner, Andrew W Zimmerman.

In addition, seeing as how RF-emfs contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction [Role of Mitochondria in the Oxidative Stress Induced by Electromagnetic Fields: Focus on Reproductive Systems](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Role+of+Mitochondria+in+the+Oxidative+Stress+Induced+by+Electromagnetic+Fields%3A+Focus+on+Reproductive+Systems&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3Dmy3juxBZ-4kJ); Silvano Junior Santini, Valeria Cordone, Stefano Falone, Mahmut Mijit, Carla Tatone, Fernanda Amicarelli, Giovanna Di Emidio, and the proliferation of increased exposure to RF-emfs via the densification of 4GLTE and 5G telecommunications networks, there's real reason for concern that these subsets will grow into the future.

Adverse vaccine reactions are reported every year yet few are [compensated for](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-vicp.pdf).

Worse yet, a million dollar grant study paid for by The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ), a partner of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and conducted by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. found: ""Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported.

Anarchy cannot enforce such a rule without local government and a judicial system (call it what you may), as one man's interpretation rule may be different from the next man's, and so on. 

This means that the consequences vary from person to person also, so one man may consider 'no nudity in this park' to warrant mere laughter and ridicule, and another may consider it to warrant actual punishment- to come to a universal conclusion of consequence agreed to by all members in the society requires a central governing body to decide that consequence and a central governing body to uphold justice. 

>.no even if it is a state run school it’s not authoritarian because state runs school are still run by THE COMMUNITY

The policy comes from government, and is enforced by government. Government decides what the children learn, not the community, and all who are employed in the school are government employees.

>. Ya I agree on the fact we should deprave them off there base needs food water and shelter but if they want to be apart of everything else society has to offer they will have to uphold society expectations .

**Percent of children aged 19-35 months receiving vaccinations for:**

* Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (4+ doses DTP, DT, or DTaP): 83.2%
* Polio (3+ doses): 92.7%
* Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) (1+ doses): 91.5%
* *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) (primary series + booster dose): 80.7%
* Hepatitis B (Hep B) (3+ doses): 91.4%
* Chickenpox (Varicella) (1+ doses): 91.0%
* Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (4+ doses): 82.4%
* Combined 7-vaccine series: 70.4%

VS

It is estimated that worldwide one in **160 children** has an ASD. This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence varies substantially across studies.

So if 1 in 160 children have an ASD then why don't over 90% of them have an ASD

"This is why we don’t have, for example, a vaccine for HIV.",kiytqq,2020-12-23 19:28:10
">Yes, it contains mercury, but it’s found in compounds, basically making the mercury good.

No most mercury compounds, including those in vaccines, are dangerous, but the dose makes the poison, and the dose is so tiny",kiytqq,2020-12-23 23:55:11
"it depends on the virus, this is why there is no vaccine for HIV, and why flu shots don;t work that well, but measles doesn't mutate as much and that vaccine works great",kiytqq,2020-12-23 23:56:10
"You're effective wrong-ish. The fact vaccines mutate are exactly why we have so many different types of vaccines for them. You have any idea how many different straibs of the Flu exist?

Theres alot. That flu shot that gets promoted every year? It isn't the same uniform formula every time. It's a different vaccine based on the city and state you're in and what type of flu virus is expected to be common there.

We don't have a vaccine for HIV/AIDS because it mutates too rapid to pin down, and we're using an mRNA vaccine right now for COVID for that very same reason. The strain recently reported of it is like... the fourth one to my recollection, which is why the COVID vaccine isn't a more tradition injection than what is commonly familiar to people.",kiytqq,2020-12-24 07:05:48

Also most vaccines no longer contain mercury preservatives.,kiytqq,2020-12-28 10:56:35
"True, I should’ve specified it. I was mainly referring to the COVID-19 one.",kiytqq,2020-12-24 04:14:43

"It is safe yes, *because the amount is small*, this is the same treason you would be completely fine if you ate a very tiny amount of cyanide, but you would not call cyanide harmless, would you?

I should also note that some mercury compounds are not only toxic but bioaccumulative, meaning that all the mercury you are exposed to gets added up, and this inspired early fears about thimerosal, but research shows that thimerosal does not bioaccumulate like some other mercury compounds, so the doses don't add up, I think this is where the ""it's nontoxic because it's a compound"" myth comes from",kiytqq,2020-12-24 06:21:25
"I know mercury is accumulates, but the point of the post is not about the structures and properties of mercury. And when I said that thimerosal is safe I meant in any dose, not just in the vaccine.",kiytqq,2020-12-24 10:06:51

"Well I'm not taking it for a while either, and unless you are older than 50 or have underlying conditions, you shouldn't take it. The immunization lasts only 90 days before you have to get another, and there is limited supply. I'm going to let older people and people with underlying conditions to take it first, before I do.

Another thing that bothers me just a little is that it is rushed, and I know that people have already taken it and they were fine, but I feel as if there's a greater chance of vaccine injury from a vaccine produced in less than a year.

I also understand your view, you're waiting for better versions of the vaccine and ones that are less rushed and more safe. What most internet troglodytes seem to not understand is that this is not being anti-vax, and for the troglodytes that think it is, read below.

Say someone invented a bicycle, which of course has two wheels, and made it in short time as to not last too long and only has 2 wheels. The chances of dying while on a bicycle are super super low, but still a worry. Instead of buying this new invention some would wait for the tricycle, with three wheels and almost no chance for death.

If you are of old age or have underlying conditions then please take the vaccine, the more of these people with the vaccine the less deaths we will have. Maybe the vaccine is completely safe, but it still worries me a little.

TLDR: If you're old or have underlying conditions take it, if you don't then I discourage it.",kia0e2,2020-12-22 23:05:53

"I used to be antivax, so I think I can answer this more accurately than most people here 

When I was antivax I did not think autism was worse than a life threatening infection, I simply did not believe that an unvaccinated kid was likely to get a serious disease 

I no longer believe vaccines to be the main cause of autism, but it is true that even before vaccines most of the infections kids got lasted days to weeks and then went away, the only common childhood disease that was normally serious was diphtheria, which antivaxers believe went away due to sanitation, not vaccines (in reality both had a role) 

It's not about thinking serious infection is better than autism, but that serious infection is a very rare result of not vaccinating",khb8os,2020-12-21 15:55:04

"Proper antivaxxers don't think like that. Don't compare us with low IQ extremists. Normally antivaxxers raises the questions about the quality and safety of vaccines, gives examples of side effects and seeks for answers. If you or your children experienced side effects you start digging and seeking for answers. And the more you search the more unclear and ""dodgy"" it become. Most likely, the ones who laughs at antivaxxers are low intellect people with zero knowledge about vaccines and ingredients (except what mainstream media tells them). They most likely lack of common sense aswell. They don't care that pharmacy is 3rs most profitable industry in the world and it needs sick humans (not healthy) to thrive. My child developed mild asthma from vaccines (as i suspect). Yes, do your research, some vaccines even officially confirmed has increased chance to cause asthma. Look at exponential diagram of increasing numbers of asthma patients alongside vaccination processes over the decades. 3500 people dies from asthma in USA every year. That's 10 per day. And nobody cares. Doctor asked me maybe someone in my family had asthma so that my daughter kind of developed it due  to dna blablabla... Nobody neither on my side or my wifes family side had asthma. It's not a bad one for my daughter but she has to breathe steroid inhalers daily for rest of her life. I won't even mention other side effects she had over first 2 years of her life. Luckily, none of them were serious enough. 
And btw:
Why put any kind of nano technology through vaccines if you can offer them for free (swipe your hand for payments, answering calls etc) and 90% of people will take it.",kgk2ce,2020-12-20 22:33:01

Definitely a risk we didn’t want to chance!

"RNA vaccines use a set or proteins and amino acids that cause the body to produce a protein response that is fatal to the targeted virus. It does not change the cells DNA. It does not do anything but amp up your natural antibodies that your body would normally create in time (hopefully before you die of it) to fight off the virus even quicker by prepping it. Rna vaccines have been being developed since the 1960s and are very easy to adapt and produce for targeted viruses and abnormalities. There are several cancer treatments on the market that went through testing and have been for sale now for 10 years successfully. This vaccine has also been third party verified and approved.

"Under the circumstances. Probably better to get the vaccine out to the people with the possability of it making things worse, than to sit on it and allow the current downward spiral to continue.

If we had the time to give it a proper length of time to test, sure. I'd say don't take it. But time isn't on our side so we'll just have to take the plunge. At any rate, there isn't enough yet to vaccinate everyone, so in a way... we ARE testing the vaccine. Right now. With everyone that it's currently being given to.

Check in at any hotel or motel.

Gyms and other facilities

"
My post is about HBV vaccine. HBV is not a deadly disease affecting children. HBV is an STD. Infants born to HBV negative mothers are extremely unlikely to come into contact with the disease which is spread by sex and needles. 95% HBV cases resolve naturally without complications. No reason to risk brain damage on the first day of life to protect against an STD.

Autism is permanent and can be profoundly debilitating.

25-50% of autism cases are non verbal.

The government's expert witness in autism court, leading scientist Andrew Zimmerman, has come out and reversed his stance on vaccines and autism:

https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/425061-how-a-pro-vaccine-doctor-reopened-debate-about-link-to-autism

The CDC admitted in in federal court on March 20, 2020 that they rely on only 20 studies to make the claim there is no link between vaccines and autism.

NONE of those studies looks at HBV vaccine. The CDC has no science to support that statement. The only studies they have are on MMR vaccine with thimerisol adjuvant. That product is not even in use anymore, meaning they have no basis for the claim vaccines do not cause autism. Of those now useless MMR studies, ZERO use a placebo control group. Here is a link to the court filing listing all the studies.

https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stipulation-and-Order-Fully-Executed.pdf

How can they study one vaccine (poorly) and claim that ALL vaccines are safe when these products have completely different ingredients. None of the 20 studies involved an aluminum adjuvanted vaccine.

There are many recent studies calling into question the neurological safety of injected aluminum vaccine adjuvant and HBV vaccine.

This study ties HBV vaccine to autism:

So, I do have a question. Did you only read the abstracts or all the articles in full?  And more importantly, did you fully understand the contexts, concepts, and findings in these articles? It is important to understand the contexts of each article and make sure they all contain proper contexts to what your conceptual basis is.

For the first article you simply put the abstract in your comment. I would like to hear what your thoughts and opinions are about the entire article. Luckily, I was able to find the free PDF version on google scholar, since my university doesn't subscribe to this journal. First off, it is quite a bit outdated for a reference when trying to make an argument for current standpoints on biological and neurological sciences on vaccines, but let's push the acceptable date to 2007 to be in your favour.  Your quoted input all came from the abstract, but let's look a little deeper into what this paper is really trying to get across.

With-in the very start of the literature review it is stated "" Universal newborn immunization with the hepatitis B vaccination was recommended in 1991 (CDC, 1991). A recent narrative review concluded that hepatitis B vaccines available since 1982 are safe and effective (Demirjian & Levy, 2009); however, safety findings from individual studies are mixed. In Vaccine Safety Datalink studies, Lewis et al. (2001) reported no evidence of a significant association between vaccination at birth and fever or neurological adverse events, Naleway et al. (2009) found an elevated, **although not statistically significant**, risk of immune hemolytic anemia in children vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, and Price et al. (2010)  reported no association between autism and vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccination during the first month of life. Additionally, Marques et al. (2007) found no association between time of hepatitis B vaccination, i.e., within 24 hrs versus 2–4 days postnatally, and neurodevelopment delays at 6 months of age.""

Now looking at how it states that ear infections and pharyngitis are seen in higher rates of vaccinated children, possibly due to suppressed immune responses. It also states that these conditions were reported after the vaccination by parents who soon saw developmental regression. So, at face value this might seem to be a link between autism and vaccines. But when you read a bit further a look a little closer what is really conveyed is that children with autism have a suppressed immune response, and due to this being a symptom of autism you see conditions like ear infections and pharyngitis at higher rates in this context.  This already starts to paint the picture of how autism and the related conditions, believed by some, are caused by vaccines are not correlated in the right direction.

Now let's move along to the results.

"" There were in total 193 children with autism diagnosis and 79,690 without autism diagnosis included in the parent sample, or a rate of **2.42 per 1000 children** (Table 1). The ratio of autistic boys to autistic girls was 5.43:1. In the total sample, 97% of children with an autism diagnosis were age 3 years and older\*\*.\*\* Sixty-one percent of children with an autism diagnosis were non-Hispanic white, compared to 60% of children without an autism diagnosis; this difference in unweighted proportions was *not* statistically significant. ""

As stated in the literature review, autism is usually diagnosed as early as 3 years old, around the time when children are still being vaccinated. Also, you basically put the entire abstract in your post, 

"" Because the current study’s sample represents infants born prior to the manufacture of thimerosal-free vaccines, questions are raised regarding the possible adverse affects of the vaccine preservative thimerosal. Of note, the relationship between neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and autism diagnosis among boys was also examined without restricting birth year to before 1999, and it was found that the association became marginally significant, and attenuated. There was one observation with autism diagnosis born in the later period, and this single observation was unvaccinated during the neonatal period. Thus, there is insufficient sample size to evaluate vaccination exposure before and after the availability of thimerosal free vaccines. ""

This is stating that the vaccines before July of 1999, which this study is based on, had components that were more harmful in development but due to the then recent changes they did not have a large enough sample size to conduct a study.

Keeping in mind that this was in referenced in the context of the findings for vaccines pre 1999 this is the best part about this article **"" . Our findings do not suggest that the risks of autism outweigh the benefits of vaccination; however, future research into hepatitis B vaccination** ***scheduling*** **is warranted. ""**

"" Consequently, no data was available to differentiate specific autism spectrum diagnoses such as Asperger syndrome from low-functioning autism, or phenotypes such as autoimmune autistic disorder (Singh 2009), delays-plus-regression autism (Ozonoff et al. 2005), and autism-epilepsy (Tuchman et al. 2009).""

So this outdated article did show that pre 1999 the Hep B vaccine did have a higher *correlation* to autism, it was not the majority nor close to it.  Also keep in mind, this article did not mention high functioning or lower functioning autism. Severity does matter. Natural developing autism was ***not*** accounted for in this study.

For this article if you are arguing that current vaccines cause autism, it would be a very weak argument as it only weakly, in a very outdated manner, connects to your conceptual basis.

I see the concern, but it has been addressed. And although this study's outcomes seems to support their hypothesis, you have to take into account what their original hypothesis is, and what other information they state in the article that also shows the prior research done in the literature review that is more recent. 

I don't have the time to go through and write a lengthy reply to all of these; but I will go through and respond to as many as I can. I'll read the rest of them, but doing a response for each one is not with-in my time limits.

*Pregnancy, Immunity, Schizophrenia, and Autism* was written in 2006. It is very old to have as a source that argues against current vaccination, and if I read it correctly, it's more so to do with maternal vaccination.

These were an interesting read though. And I can see why you might distrust vaccines, and *possibly* making an argument that vaccines should be given at an older age, but let me ask you two questions. Can you explain all the relating factors, e.g., the neuro and biological components, each of these research articles have to each other?

"The abstracts provide an easy synopsis, but yes I have read the text. Gallagher 2010 is indeed dated and looking at thimerisol containing vaccines. However it is useful for the proposition that an immune activation event in a neonate can have neurological consequences.

Patterson is useful because although that research relates to prenatal development, it likewise suggests that brain development is affected by immune activation. 

We have to view this data in light of exploding autism rates that correlate with an expanding vaccine schedule. The recent animal studies cited suggest that aluminum adjuvant is neurologically harmful to the developing brain in mammals, although as you point out that damage can be apparently reversed over time. It is important to consider however that those animals are receiving a single vaccine and that developing children are receiving many aluminum adjuvanted vaccines. Flarend 1997 show that insoluble aluminum salts migrate to the brain:

The clinical trials of these vaccines end mere days after the final dose, however autism is typically diagnosed around 4 years of age. We have no meaningful safety data regarding the neurological impact of these products and the manufacturers are exempt from all liability. As autism rates continue to rise, we must look at this environmental factor seriously.",kfk5je,2020-12-24 05:08:27

HBV is not a deadly disease affecting children. HBV is an STD. Kids born to HBV negative mothers are extremely unlikely to come into contact with the disease. 95% HBV cases resolve without complications.

Autism is permanent and can be profoundly debilitating.

25-50% of autism cases are non verbal.

https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/425061-how-a-pro-vaccine-doctor-reopened-debate-about-link-to-autism

The CDC admitted in in federal court on March 20, 2020 that they rely on only 20 studies to make the claim there is no link between vaccines and autism.

NONE of those studies looks at HBV vaccine. The CDC has no science to support that statement. The only studies they have are on MMR vaccine with thimerisol adjuvant. That product is not even in use anymore, meaning they have no basis for the claim vaccines do not cause autism. Of those now useless MMR studies, ZERO use a placebo control group. Here is a link to the court filing listing all the studies.

https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stipulation-and-Order-Fully-Executed.pdf

How can they study one vaccine (poorly) and claim that ALL vaccines are safe when these products have completely different ingredients. None of the 20 studies involved an aluminum adjuvanted vaccine.

There are many recent studies calling into question the neurological safety of injected aluminum vaccine adjuvant and HBV vaccine.

“Results support the hypothesis that, among boys born before 1999, there is a differ- ence in the OR for autism diagnosis in boys vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccination during the first month of life compared to later- or never-vaccinated boys. Our finding of increased risk for autism diagnosis among male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vac- cine is novel.

"I want to start off with saying, science and research is a beautiful world where exploration and understanding can happen. I may not agree with your view, but keeping an open but critical mind is important when reading research. There is no point to have a petty argument as it is not efficient; so intelligent and mature conversations are a better route.

Also, seeing you are an attorney made me smile. I have a side interest in policy and the judicial system. It also explains your forethought of citing the article about why research that involves mice in this case is important. I assume you have graduated and are practicing so you, unfortunately, only have access to what can be found without having to pay a journal. I really do wish open science was more prominent. 

I do want to know your overall stance on vaccines. For the HB vaccine, do you believe it should be given later on in life, or are you against it completely? Do you have issue with all vaccines? 

For the article you shared yesterday, it is from 1997.

Issues I see with this one is low sample size. And the data should be taken with caution. I will post an article that is more open with their data, as data manipulation should be looked for when reading research articles.

For your second article. It should be taken with caution as well. Reporters do not have an understanding of research that scientists have and often can misinterpret findings. It is an issue within the scientific community. It should also be noted, what intention did the writer have, what are his biases, is he aware of his biases, what is his agenda? All questions that should and hopefully are kept in the mind of researchers and the hopefully the public while reading any type of article.

Although it is 11 years old I recommend you read  [this.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000114) It has valid points about many things including how the scientific community responds to the public. In research you stray away from absoluteness or leaving no space for future research to show different findings, as science is ever evolving and it would be irresponsible to say something is set in stone. It does mention a subgroup just as your article stated, but it also goes along that same conclusion that screening should be done. 

I recommend [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-018-2988-4), for explanation on genetic and environmental factors.

[Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14006367) is a meta-analysis. I believe you should have access to it.

The last analysis you has some vagueness to it that makes me question the possible basis in mind while conducting the experiment.

[This](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-012-6716-y) is another meta-analysis. One of the points made is the availability of populations. It also mention the issue with pulling from a large pool from a database.",kfk5je,2020-12-24 20:21:30

"Mate the abstract is an outline of the work and if briefly used to explain of the paper. Otherwise there would be no point in a conclusion or a discussion of findings. This doesn't say which sampling methods were used, whick socio-economic variables were accounted, which types of ASD disorders were considered for or give any interpretation of the results. The paper also establishes a correlation, not a causation between the jab and ASD. A causation would be impossible since ASD is an innate condition caused by around 50 genetic mutations. What you're doing is the intellectual equivalent of reading the first paragraph off a Wikipedia page. Having an understanding of something is not just about throwing superficial facts and big numbers around blindly, it's also about having the correct methodology and an in depth understanding of the subject.

"Vaccines cause autism.

**""Findings suggest that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine prior to 1999 (from vaccination record) had a threefold higher risk for parental report of autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated as neonates during that same time period. Nonwhite boys bore a greater risk.""**

There are zero long term safety studies of this vaccine.

To address the neurological safety of a product long term clinical trials and placebo based safety studies are relevant. Those have never been done with this product. Merck and GSK (the 2 companies that supply these vaccines to us) have documented history of lying about safety and manipulating studies to hide fatal side effects of their drugs.

GSK recently withheld data of suicide risk in kids while marketing Paxil to them.

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-fraud-settlement.html

Merck recently set out to “destroy” doctors exposing heart attack risks of Vioxx.

These are the companies you are putting your faith in.

This is a 2016 study exploring the neurotoxicicity of this vaccine.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/

The professional researchers carrying out this study found that HBV had a neurotoxic effect.

""This work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as **autism** and multiple sclerosis (Gallagher and Goodman, 2010; Stubgen, 2012). This study used the same vaccine and a similar time schedule to those used for human infant vaccination in China. Therefore, these findings suggest that there may be similar effects of neonatal HBV vaccination on brain development and behavior in humans.""

This is a 2018 study on the subject:

“These findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.” IL-4 mediates the delayed neurobehavioral impairments induced by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination that involves the down-regulation of the IL-4 receptor in the hippocampus.""

Wang X, et al. Cytokine. 2018. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29751176/

This 2018 study found brain damage from the aluminum adjuvant used in HBV.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29221615/

""This is the first experimental study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that aluminum adjuvants can impair social behaviour if applied in the early period of postnatal development.""

This 2017 study likewise found that low dose aluminum adjuvant impaired behavior:

""Neurobehavioural changes, including decreased activity levels and altered anxiety-like behaviour, were observed compared to controls in animals exposed to 200μg Al/kg but not at 400 and 800μg Al/kg. Consistently, microglial number appeared increased in the ventral forebrain of the 200μg Al/kg group.""

After the program began, the vaccine was associated with an increase in reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause paralysis, respiratory arrest, and death. The immunization program was ended after approximately 25% of the population of the United States had been administered the vaccine.

Also this vaccine “associated” with Guillain Barré syndrome, got any figures for how prevalent it was? There are always risks with vaccines, however the chances are obscenely low, for instance around 5-10 children out of 10 million who receive the MMR vaccine can die of a fatal form of measles that hides in the brain... So the MMR vaccine also increases reports of fatal measles cases, without context news can be very misleading",kg0h03,2020-12-20 15:54:32

The COVID piece of the vaccine was done in 8 months but the technology behind the method of action of the vaccine has been researched for far longer. mRNA vaccine tech is not new and it certainly wasn’t developed in 8 months.,kfr01u,2020-12-18 19:07:11

To address what you obviously would rather discuss, the lack of ability to sue is not intended to make people miserable. The law in question is stated clearly in the article as including the words “as long as it’s not due to willful misconduct”. This means that if they did all they could do to assure your safety and shit still happened they cannot be held responsible for that. That’s incentive for innovation and has held true over decades. It’s not new and it’s not particular to vaccines. 

If they lacked doing the appropriate animal/in vitro and human studies to guarantee safety, then this wouldn’t apply and you could hold them responsible. So I’m not sure that *you* read the article or bothered to understand it before trying to fear monger.",kfr01u,2020-12-18 19:12:56

That’s about a protocol that we’ve set forth recognizing that it’s the way best way we could ensure safety. A protocol that the companies themselves don’t determine.

Far as that percentage the anti's mentioned though....

That is more than likely a contributing factor to having such a high survival percentage at the moment.

I’m not blind. I’m assuming you aren’t either. If you watch the video, it’s clear he isn’t getting anything injected into him. You’d have to convince people otherwise, because we’re literally watchful it with the naked eye. 

A conspiracy theory would be whatever reasoning a conspiracy theorist would come up with to explain why it happened. 

It’s also stupid to tell people to blindly believe every excuse they hear. 5 total people get vaccinated on LIVE TV, and they fuck that up. They should either not air it, or do a better job of creating security in people. 

Pretending like this mistake isn’t a big deal is stupid, because the negligence here wouldn’t be okay in any setting where anyone’s getting vaccinated, and it certainly isn’t okay when we’ve got enough anti vaxers and anti maskers looking for excuses to not trust the government. 

PS: They could’ve obviously just injected him with saline solution if they wanted to lie for the cameras,  and I can think of more reasons why it is a fuck up rather than conspiracy.

I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

"""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.""- the Word of God.

“Researchers sometimes do studies based on analyses of medical records, but trials that test patients randomly assigned to get an experimental drug or placebo are considered the gold standard of drug trials.” You can’t control the patients included in this study so baseline differences in the cases and their severity, risk etc isn’t a controlled variable. Overall the Henry Ford study has been discredited by the medical community and goes against multiple, more thoroughly done research that fits the standards in the quote. Also post actual primary literature not something diluted by a journalist.

Talks about the same flawed study from the first link. Also the AAPS is a fringe group of conservative physicians and DO NOT represent the medical community in any appreciable way.

I don’t expect laymen to read, digest and interpret primary literature. It is something that even physicians with the best intentions struggle to do well. Having said that, anyone with even a basic science degree can tell you why a retrospective chart review study doesn’t count as quality science and should not be the basis of pushing a treatment we have shown is dangerous and confers no benefit through rigorous, randomised, controlled studies.

The vaccine also has side effects of it’s own

Pain, swelling, or redness where the shot was given
Mild fever
Chills
Feeling tired
Headache
Muscle and joint aches
Fainting can also happen after any medical procedure, including vaccinations.

Keep in mind that most common side effects are a sign that your body is starting to build immunity (protection) against a disease

Serious side effects from vaccines are extremely rare. For example if 1 million doses of a vaccine are given, 1 to 2 people may have a severe allergic reaction.

Nothing is being forced on them, they have choices about it all. And by the way, this country has always required vaccines. They used to vaccinate kids in school without even bothering to get parent’s consent. It should be that way. Unvaccinated people are a danger to everyone, I firmly believe that if someone dies after coming in contact with an unvaccinated person that that that person should be tried for murder.

I can understand people's, often uninformed, fears, we are only human. Take the thalidomide issue. However this was ~60 years ago and so much knowledge has been learned since then. Many laws were put in place to prevent this social disaster happening again. 

I don't believe they even did any trials on pregnant women before they released it. Madness.

I don't believe a vaccination that has been worked on since the late 80s and has been medically trialled on people should be feared.

If someone is going on about Bill Gates' microchips then they are true idiots. I do not believe you are one of those people though. 

This misinformation and lies is a disgrace. It is no wonder that a lot of these ideas of dangerous and rushed vaccinations develop in a country that lets business make huge profit out of health. 

What's that guy called that changed the cost of medication from being in around $20 to nearly $800? He is in prison now anyway. 

I think when you are from a place where socialism (NOT FUCKING COMMUNISM) is the preferred movement of government, it doesn't make any sense to rush a vaccine. 

These are my thoughts anyway. 

Take the vaccine, it's unfair to people who are unable to take it.

"Now that science is developing a greater understanding of nanoparticles and the use of algorithms, we should be embracing this kind of breakthrough. 

It does all sound a bit Prey by Michael Crichton but can you imagine if the internet existed when they first developed vaccines? People were being told they were going to have a virus injected into them, even if they haven't been poorly. It would be exactly the same response, I imagine. 

Scepticism should be encouraged in life but not to the point of covering one's ears and going ""la la laaaaa!"" if they don't like the evidence they are receiving.

Critical thinking should be taught from a young age.

It doesn't change your DNA and it's not like they are making things out of plastic to be injected. From what I can gather, using the algorithms, they can test millions and millions of possible variants and use nanotechnology to teach the DNA how it needs to react to new viruses.

This kind of medical breakthrough is what will be the cure for cancer and much more beyond that. It should be celebrated.

Unexpectedly, the amount of antibodies that the body produced from these proteins (that aren’t the virus itself) was enough to interfere with HIV testing. 

They stopped using that vaccine because it interfered with the accuracy of the HIV tests, not because anyone actually had the virus. Thanks.",kdgcp8,2020-12-17 15:17:21

"That’s why they stopped using it! They also didn’t want people to test positive after the vaccine because it interferes with actual testing. 

The word “vaccine” comes from the first virus that a vaccine was discovered for. Which was the Vaccinia virus (cow pox) which was found to give immunity to its more serious counterpart in the pox virus family, smallpox. 

Similarly, Vaccinia comes from the word “Vacca” which is Latin for cow.

EDIT: also, the vaccine is not genetic engineering. Using mRNA is not going to change our genes. The way viruses work is that they hijack our cells to produce their own proteins. The vaccine does this on a negligible scale by allowing ONE protein that the virus uses to be created by the viral mRNA so that our body will learn how to respond to the real virus.",kdgcp8,2020-12-18 06:15:38

"It may be rushed but it hasn't cut any corners. A lot of the information on Covid actually existed before covid existed (bear with me). This is because in 2003/04 there was another coronavirus pandemic called SARS, which a vaccine had started to be developed but then was abandoned after SARS disappeared completely. However covid has a lot in similar to SARS and since they were around 90% through the vaccine development for SARS they could just transfer the info that related over to the covid vaccine. Also vaccines need I think 3 phases of human testing with a minimum of 30,000 people per phase, they do a placebo for some (water and salt mixture) and the actual vaccine for others. 2 people had complications out of the 90,000 people who took part. 1 had taken the placebo so their condition was unrelated to the vaccine and the other person's complications was a blood vessel condition that was found to be unrelated. This however doesn't guarantee that there won't be REACTIONS to the vaccine, as every body reacts differently, however the chances of developing complications due to the vaccine are very very low.",kcinly,2020-12-14 13:31:50

"It's also that they're using a new production method. Instead of putting a weakened or dead virus for our immune cells to recognise as a threat and fight off, they use mRNA. This gives an instruction to the cell to produce a protein that is found on the outside of the virus called a spike protein. The cell displays the protein on its surface and the immune system recognises that this isn't supposed to be there. You then mount an immune response and your body learns to attack the protein so that it immediately recognises the virus as a threat. That's the simplified version anyways, I don't think I'm qualified to go into too much more detail.

"Ok, so here's my thing. I'm not anti-vaccine, I don't trust this vaccine due to the sketchiness of the situation. Why is this being pushed so hard and so fast when other viruses in the past didn't receive the same treatment, for instance, Swine flu, avian flu, Ebola, etc? I also heard Bill Gates made comments about overpopulation which also makes me uneasy. For the record I realize I could be wrong but if rather be safe than sorry. The rumors of nanobots being put into a vaccine are also making me and my partner feel uneasy about this. For years the government has been using the media to manipulate the people and lead you in the direction they need you to go like cattle, it all comes down to money and power. I am not Republican nor Democrat I do not adhere to any political party because I feel like a person should think for one's themself instead of doing what one person you've never met and knows nothing about you or what you're dealing with. If the government wasn't in control of all this I wouldn't be so uneasy about all this if I'm being honest.

">nor the fact that the vitamin D is given in a potentially toxic amount

the recommendation of 5000-10000 iu/day is perfectly inline with the actual research on safety of vitamin D:

 [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22414585/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22414585/) 

> In conclusion, long-term daily intakes of up to and including 10 000 IU of vitamin D maximize physiologic benefits and are safe. 

the 50000 iu/day on the first page is very likely short term.

also please read the paper, that i liked on what the results of overdosing on vitamin D actually are. if you manage to take 80000+ iu/day for a long period for example:

>  In another case, a man with multiple  
sclerosis consumed escalating amounts of vitamin D (8000–88  
000 IU/d) for 4 y; he exhibited hypercalcemia only when his  
serum 25-OHD concentration exceeded 1100 nmol/L \[201\]. 

and perfectly fitting here:

>  The daily consumption of 50 000 IU  
of vitamin D by healthy adults for 8 wk produced serum 25-OHD  
concentrations as high as 643 nmol/L, without changes in serum  
concentrations of calcium or 1,25-(OH)2D and in the absence of  
adverse reactions or side effects \[189\]. These results suggest that  
instead of 10 000 IU/d, the highest observed safe intake of vitamin  
D is 50 000 IU/d.

2 months 50000 iu/day of vitamin D no  adverse effects, despite being hugely over the suggested ideal vitamin D blood level range of  125-200 noml/l

so if you read somewhere, that 10000 iu of vitamin D3 can be dangerous, then they are just throwing around unscientific nonsense, that is not based on real world testing.

great article about vitamin D in general btw:

 [http://health101.org/art\_cancer\_vitamin\_D.htm](http://health101.org/art_cancer_vitamin_D.htm) 

and in regards to iodine, i have been taking  50  mg of iodine for many months.

those are longterm however medical supplementation therapy levels, that should not be done on your own and require  you to look for bromine detoxification, thyroid function a bit, when you are on thyroid meds and get co-factors in to get the iodine properly absorbed.

a lot of the iodine c-factors are actually part of the suggested therapy by this person here already like vitamin C, zink for example.

however we are again looking at shortterm use it seems.

taking 25 mg/day of iodine for a few days or even 50 certainly isn't anything to be concerned about and definitely not toxic.

i have been taking 50 mg/day again for many many months and it massively improved my health, because i had a very big iodine deficiency.

i wish i could talk about intravenous vitamin C, but 2.5 grams of vitamin C doesn't sound like much at all. orally i have been taking 6 grams per day and while of course ingestion can't be compared to injection, i must say, that 2.5 grams of vitamin c still seem lowish. i am not aware of the absorption curve of oral vitamin C vs injections. so feel free to enlighten me about it, if you have data on 2.5 grams of injection vitamin C could be an issue.

so do you have any data of 2.5 grams of  intravenous injections are an issue at all?

oh and in regards to vitamin A. 100000 iu of vitamin A per day is not uncommon.

if one gets measles the actual REAL and helpful treatment is 200000 iu/day for 2 days of  vitamin A.

example study about vitamin A for measles:

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1245303/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1245303/) 

measles is an extremely harmless infection of course, but if you happen to be vitamin A deficient, then it could be an issue, hence the 200k iu/day for 2 days.

100000 iu of vitamin A per day  is well within safe limits for adults in comparison then.

so nothing seems to be at any unsafe levels from the things, that i know about at least.

i have no idea about safety of  hydrogen peroxide  however, but please research it properly, rather than assuming, that x level is unsafe, because someone said say.

your assumption was clearly wrong for vitamin D for example.",kck33y,2020-12-16 05:14:51

Then, the website quotes other antivax websites and not some official, peer reviewed articles, which is not a great sign either, and if it quotes some reliable source, either the quote is inaccurate/forged, either the articles are not relevant to the matter.

"As someone who's actually going into this field as a PhD candidate next year, I can understand some of the concerns this person brings up. Primarily, potential side effects that could occur at higher doses (such as inflammation) because this mrna vaccine will stimulate a completely different part of the immune system in a different way than traditional vaccines. However, it's also important to consider that mrna treatments to treat tumors have shown to be effective and secondly, that we're in a pandemic and any progress in developing a vaccine will overwhelmingly outweigh the potential side effects. Despite this being the first of its kind, this mrna vaccine was developed in such a way that the only parts being injected are the genes that code proteins known to being subjected to immune surveillance without any of the typical pro-infection/pro-mitotic protein or the signals it could stimulate. Some of the surveillance proteins may have signaling that could still trigger and inflammation cascade in the body, which is why there has already been a disclaimer that pregnant women and young children can't be given the vaccine since they're at risk for this effect. Traditional vaccines on the other hand simply have an attenuated strain of the pathogen, but mutations can still occur to regain its pathogenicity or develop into a new strain. This is a possibility (although I do need to emphasize that it's extremely rare and it's not at all a reason to avoid vaccines altogether) but through genetic manipulation, the tentative mrna vaccine won't have this same possibility whatsoever, making it safer in that regard.

I couldn't find the original post since I think its better to spread correct information, but at least if the OP finds this, I hope they read this. I wouldn't downvote their post, since it seems like they were genuinely concerned and simply uninformed, which isn't a reason to label someone as antivax (I would question their experience in academia, however, since this info can be quickly found on Google scholar). I personally also had some concerns while the vaccine was in the early clinical stages and there were rumors of it being rushed through stage 3. However, upon reading their publications and seeing the safety and efficacy data, my concerns subsided and a vaccine with few unknowns is so much better than catching the virus with who knows what long-term effects that it may cause. Concerns are great imo because it's how science pushes itself and keeps itself in check! I love it!

Also, in terms of risk, I’m not really sure I follow. Nasal sprays include the real deal, the actual live virus, albeit weakened I think, but with a possibility to cause the actual disease, that’s a lot riskier than injecting some mRNA that tells cells to make the spike proteins, as these proteins can’t cause the virus they’re trying to prevent.

This is the FIRST vaccine that uses mRNA there are a gazillion other vaccines people get and are being given daily to people for other things that use weakened viruses to produce antibodies instead of mRNA. The whole point is nasal sprays/oral vaccines should be the first way to administer vaccines in general, they are cheaper and easier to store and administer and all these viruses/bacteria they are supposed to protect against infect you through your mouth or nose. 

Also why is the mRNA vaccine causing similar side effects to other vaccines that use weakened or live virus if it does not have any virus in it? Also to say its safer in the short run, what in the world? You want something safer in the long run not the short run lol. 

Whats crazy is this article listing the side effects of the covid-19 vaccine the FDA warns about it says - ""Likely to be localized in the arm, but potentially appearing elsewhere, some of these pains may be signs that your immune system is making antibodies in response to the viruses in the vaccine.""

"Apologies if it didn’t make sense, although I didn’t have any issue re reading it myself, let me try to work through the points you mentioned

I never said this wasn’t the first mRNA, i’m fully aware it is, and whilst not new to science (as we’ve been researching these for decades, cited in the CDC website linked below) theres no doubt that we’ve never had one mass produced before. From my understanding, mRNA vaccines are much faster and cheaper to produce than nasal/oral, again as cited in the website linked below, and in the middle of a pandemic where thousands die every day, prioritising a fast means of treatment at a small risk (as i said, we’ve known about mRNA vaccines for a lot longer, whilst we don’t have many large scale trials to work with, we’re not taking a stab in the dark). If we waited for the nasal vaccine to finish (which again, is in development, but the mRNA vaccine finished first) then we’d be letting people die for no good reason. 

The mRNA vaccine causes the same symptoms as regular vaccines because it causes a similar immune response, in both situations your body notices things that shouldn’t be there, and reacts accordingly, this is also why many vaccines for completely different illnesses have similar side effects, your immune system doesn’t care what it’s being invaded by, it just does what it knows how to do: remove it and remember it for next time. I also didn’t say I’d prefer it to be safer in the short run, there are definitely possibilities for long term issues we haven’t seen yet, that being said, the risk is pretty small as we have a good understanding of these vaccines. I can’t deny that this isn’t ideal as we have little to no evidence of it being safe in the long run, we’re going entirely off theory, but I doubt experts would decide to push this vaccine forward if there were any obvious signs within their theory of long term issues.

As I mentioned, here’s the website I got all this from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html",kahktm,2020-12-14 22:45:19

"Obviously gastric acid affects only orally administered vaccines. 

It appears that only live attenuated vaccines can be administered via the oral or nasal route and be effective. My reading though is a problem with a live vaccine are that they actually can revert back to their non attenuated (stronger) version of the disease. So far this has only been observed in oral polio vaccine. 

So, it appears that only live attenuated vaccines can be effective when administered orally or nasally. Since the Sars-COV-2 vaccine is not live attenuated but an mRNA  it needs to be administered intramuscularly and with multiple doses.

Nasal vaccine has to be a live virus that’s why it’s not safe,kahktm,2020-12-14 21:51:50
"Yes, I am saying the info is incorrect, or simplified to make it easier to understand, mRNA vaccines contain the code within the virus, so *technically speaking* you can say it’s the virus if you squint a lot, but it isn’t, it’s just a part of the virus that tells cells what to do, and as I said, your body doesn’t care if it’s a virus or some dirt, it sees an intruder and it attacks it. The mRNA vaccine tells your cells to make the spike proteins present on the sars-cov2 virus, the cells then die and release the spike proteins into the surrounding area, which gets picked up by the immune system the same way it would if there were viruses present, but in this case there’s no viruses, and therefore no threat of infection, as the spike proteins themselves can’t infect more cells and repeat the cycle.

Also, if nasal vaccines are, as you say, always cheaper, then how do we have an injectable vaccine ready to go whilst the nasal one is still in development? And if we’ve rushed it and it’s so unsafe, why would we do that? Who serves to gain from killing people from an untested vaccine?

"It all has to do with what was already being worked on. It's a misrepresentation to say that nucleic acid vaccines are entirely unproven. While none have been approved in humans they have been the primary focus of many biotech companies for a number of years now. They're safety and immunogenicity have been well established. When the pandemic started, the fastest thing to do was for companies like moderna to use their current platform to develop a sarscov2 vaccine. This is a very straight forward process, and allows them to use the same manufacturing process. Not only are live attenuated viruses inherently riskier (as mentioned above) but they are NOT straight forward to create. Either you have to rationally choose a gene to mutate which requires extensive knowledge of the viruses biology or you have to passage the virus through an alternate host for several years, until it picks up the right mutations on its own. These are not great or fast options. Injecting a single gene to generate neutralizing antibodies should be the cleanest and safest way to generate a new vaccine.

Once inside the cells, the vaccine's RNA functions as mRNA, causing the cells to build the foreign [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) that would normally be produced by a [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) (such as a virus) or by a cancer cell. These protein molecules stimulate an [adaptive immune response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_response) which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells.""

Teaches the body? Why would the body need to be taught this and not do it on its own????? OH WAIT, most people who get COVID don't even have any symptoms or recover after 2 weeks with symptoms similar to the flu so the body does do this on its own. If somebody has some genetic deficiency that does not allow their body to then they would be in the minority and they should be the ones only being selected to take the vaccine.   


""To induce cells to make proteins that they do not normally produce, it is possible to introduce heterologous mRNA into the [cytoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm)  of the cell, bypassing the need for transcription. In other words, a  blueprint for foreign proteins is *smuggled* into the cells. To achieve this goal, however, ***one must bypass cellular systems that prevent the penetration and translation of foreign mRNA***. There are nearly-ubiquitous  [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) called [ribonucleases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonuclease)  (also called RNAses) that break down conventional, i.e. unmodified,  mRNA. **There are also intracellular barriers against foreign mRNA, such  as** [**innate immune system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system) **receptors** [**toll-like receptor (TLR) 7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR7) **and** [**TLR8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR8)**, located in** [**endosomal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosome) **membranes.**""

HELL NO, these toll receptors and things are designed to defend the body your literally opening up your own cells to be inserted with something you are blindly believing from big corporations who have a history of killling billions of people to do who knows what!

Wait, is Bill Gates the face of vaccines a man with no medical background not on record verified fact-checked to have said vaccines are a means of population control!? Wait, yes he is and he did say that and you can even look up the speech to hear him say itself from his own mouth!

That is the thing though they control the media and articles that go out so they write these things in a manipulative way so people don't think.

"Oh wow, we're bringing a lot of stuff into this. Since my training is in molecular biology, and the original topic was focused on vaccine mechanisms, I'll try to stick to that. Maybe you could start a new thread for all the Bill Gates and adverse  reaction stuff, that would be fun. I have seen the video you referred to, but I don't know much about the other stuff. Could you post your sources on the HIV cases you mentioned?


But let's go back to the science. You are totally right about the mechanism of transfection. The idea is to use nucleic acids to get a cell to express a foreign protein. We do it all the time, in fact I just finished a transfection protocol this evening. However, you seem to misunderstand what happens in a natural infection. During a Sarscov2 infection, a virus injects ALL of its RNA into your cells and hijacks your cellular machinery to make copies of itself. Our body has many innate receptors like you've mentioned to prevent this from occuring. However, because Sarscov2 is able to replicate and spred in humans, we can empirically conclude that the virus has successfully evaded our defenses. 

Now, you have a choice. You can either wait for a natural infection where a virus will express all of its foreign proteins in your cells or you can get a vaccine that produces just one of these proteins. Either way, your body will produce spike protein and ""learn"" to reject that antigen in the future. For young people, the choice is not very significant, because Sarscov2 seldom makes young people critically ill. For older individuals the benefit to risk ratio is very different, and a targeted, non replicating vaccine would be a wonderful option. 

You seem to be quite distrusting of the biotechnology industry, and claim it has killed billions of people. I certainly think there is some reason to be distrustful. However, the irony is that viruses are the obvious killer here. In wealthier countries it's easy to forget, but without vaccines, millions of Americans alive today would have never made it to adulthood.",kahktm,2020-12-13 00:27:26

"Well then it’s a good thing that being pro-vaccine is about the noble cause of reducing disease in the world and not entertainment. We’d be fucked if it was about entertainment, it’s not a funny topic. Maybe this is old, but maybe it’s someone’s first time, or even tenth time, seeing it but this time they share it on Facebook where someone else sees it and whatever, but if it saves one life it was worth it, and if it doesn’t there was still that chance making it ultimately a good thing. If this sub is just for vaccination-related entertainment then I must be in the wrong place, cause I’m here cause I care about getting people vaccinated. Make no mistake about it homie, this is propaganda in service of a noble goal, it should be shared as much as possible, it’s not for us cause we already vaccinate, it’s for them.

"6 died: 4 on placebo & 2 on vaccine. The deaths were unrelated as with a testing group of 40,000 including older people over several months, a few dying of heart attacks & strokes is expected. It is highly unlikely it's related to the vaccine, especially if temporally remote from vaccination.

"Alrighty then. Here we go:

Let's first try to understand what allergies are. Essentially, allergies are when your immune system overreacts to a certain (usually otherwise safe) substances (this is almost criminally basic, but that's the gist of it). NOW, most allergic reactions are harmless, causing maybe some discomfort and perhaps some rashes. 

The recent rise in allergies can be chalked up to the rising cleanliness of our children. One (again, just ONE of many) of the reasons our bodies may continue to overreact to certain substances is b/c they weren't exposed to it when they were developing ie when they were kids. By getting sick and being exposed to different substances, our bodies kinda realized that this is normal and learns not to kick into overdrive everytime the substance is present (cough cough but some kids can't develop immunities towards certain diseases which is where VACCINES come in). Now here's the thing: b/c we always keep our place of residence and our kids spick and span, a greater number of kids don't have the opportunity to develop these immunities. This is especially true when it comes to things like dust or fur allergies. 

To reiterate, kids are developing more and more allergies b/c they aren't being given the chance to lick the dirt off their shoes as often. 

That said, you still need to vaccinate your child. Cats may cause an itchy nose, but measles is probably gonna kill them. 

Again, this is almost *criminally* simple explanation for a fairly complex and widely researched issue. Talk to your DOCTOR and NOBODY ELSE is you're concerned about your vaccines or allergies.",kaf66i,2020-12-10 14:33:10
"They have been around since mankind existed and there is literature dating back to the ancient greeks referring to it. People with severe allergies usually died in early childhood, sometimes they would attribute these deaths to witchcraft or the the devil. Childhood deathrates for children with allergies was significant until the 1970s when testing became easier. Before then most didn't even know they had an allergy until they were exposed and often that was too late. Testing has gotten easier and we are testing for more things so of course therefore we are finding more.",kaf66i,2020-12-10 14:32:15
"Allergies have likely been around since the human race began, but documentation tends to be sparse at such early times.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy#Changing_frequency) has a nice outline of why the prevalence has gone up and some history on it (though the article only dates back to approximately 27BC).

Before you continue on this #antivax crusade, I should note that this subreddit is actually a very pro-vax subreddit.  If you want to try to make a martyr out of yourself, I won't stop you, but I will at least warn you.",kaf66i,2020-12-10 14:28:43

"Your also forgetting a big one. Years ago befor we understood allergies kids just died. So unless you knew some one who had it and died you probably never heard of it. Also you wouldn't know what caused the death. 

Additionally our diets have expoloded with Verity. 200years ago our diats would have been very very basic. You may have been deathly allergic to peanuts but peanuts didn't exist in your little corner of the world. 

If I'm not mistaken the issue with allergys related to vaccines is usually (obviously not always) because they use egg protein. 

So it's not a vaccine allergy it's an egg allergy. Like anything you put in your body if you have allergies. You need to check the ingredients.",kaf66i,2020-12-10 15:56:35

"You're absolutely right, people should have the right to do whatever they want so long as it doesn't harm anyone. With that being said I support the choice to vaccinate, however I also think that if you choose not to vaccinate and you don't have a valid medical reason as noted by a physician, you should have restricted access to public services. If you feel the need to not vaccinate, you should have to pay for medical treatment and forfeit any government assistance in regards to medical bills. The same goes for public schools, children not vaccinated (again unless medically exempt) should be prohibited from attending public schools.

You absolutely should have the choice to vaccinate or not, but you should be prepared to live with the consequences of making that choice.

"No one is denying health care, just revoking the governments involvement in paying for it. Antivaxxors shouldn't be given free or subsidized Healthcare if by their actions they show they do not care about those around them. Their choices can cause more people to get sick costing the government more. If they contribute to the problem, they don't deserve to have universal Healthcare. They're more than welcome to get Healthcare, just they should get billed for it. 

Its not a punishment. Its a condition that should be met to receive it. Everyone should be free to make their choice, however choices have consequences. You're actively putting people in danger by not vaccinating, and if you don't have a valid medical exemption they absolutely should get restricted public services. 

With that being said, anyone should have the ability to get vaccines free of cost. I don't know about america, but Canada's vaccines are in large part free. There should be no excuse for people to not be able to get vaccinations.",k9gz3i,2020-12-10 03:37:25
"Its a freedom of choice, human rights thing. Its currently illegal for me to push/punch someone. Also illegal for me to rape someone, rightly so.

"There aren't vaccines for HIV because it's already a highly preventable disease and has existing treatments to begin with.

We don't have vaccines for the common cold because.... it's the fucking common cold! Don't know about any of you out there, but I can't recall a single instance where a person didn't experience more than being inconvienced slightly by a cold.

COVID is getting a vaccine so quickly because it's the first disease we've had in hundreds of years to litterally cripple the entire known world! If HIV or a cold could do that. You bet your ass we would have them on a higher priority than we do!

Oh yeah, and cancer isn't a virus. So we CAN'T make a vaccine for it. Also, again... cancer hasn't managed to cripple the entire world! COVID is a bit of a higher priority than even a wasting disease like cancer right now because of that.",k8ul4b,2020-12-09 06:50:37

"1. The HIV vaccines are still being tested and there is a huge probability that they might fail due to the replication cycle of the virus, that thing is a pain in the ass because it's replication enzymes make so many mistakes that you can end with 4 types of the same virus that work and look slightly different, making the vaccines almost useless.
2. The main treatment for common cold is symptomatic because there are a shit ton of viruses that can cause common cold and the symptoms aren't that dangerous.
3. Different cancers have different causes, different structures and different everything, making them almost unpredictable",k8ul4b,2020-12-08 10:35:32

Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses.

But you are correct, this is a ridiculous sign!",k8ul4b,2020-12-08 02:39:32
"Cancer is a generic term for a huge variety of diseases. There probably will never be a cure for cancer. There are treatments and even a vaccine for cervical cancer as we know that's caused by the HPV virus.

HIV is a different beast. Again, it's caused by a virus and we have very few treatments to cure viruses other than the human immune system. The best defence is prevention and that's why we use vaccines.

Common cold is also another virus and can't be treated by antibiotics because they only work on bacteria.

There are some anti viral drugs but generally these are used to suppress rather than remove the virus.",k8ul4b,2020-12-08 02:44:32

"Also, antiretrovirals for HIV have come leaps and bounds.  We are now at the point where those who are HIV positive and wanting to conceive can reduce their viral load to undetectable with antiretrovirals, have unprotected sex, and have essentially minimal risk for passing along HIV.  I hate to say no risk, but the data shows it is an increasingly minimal risk.",k8ul4b,2020-12-08 14:11:05

"There have been two documented cases where a person known to have HIV were later shown to be clear of the virus.

This doesn't mean there is a cure but it gives some hope.

I'm wracking my old tired brain here but there was one in London and the other in Berlin. Normally, the anti retro virus medications can suppress the action of the virus but if the treatment is stopped then the virus returns.

The two cures happened as part of a treatment regime for cancers. It involved destroying immune and blood forming cells, which is obviously very high risk, and replacing the bone marrow with an HIV resistant marrow.

So currently there is no cure for HIV.that can be used by the general population. The treatment that worked is quite dangerous, where the patient has no immune system and HIV resistant bone marrow doesn't really grow on trees.

What we do know is that HIV can be cured but the method so far would likely kill more people than it cured.",k8ul4b,2020-12-08 17:04:12

"Just incase anyone needs a summary: I'll just go quickly, do your own research for more in-depth info, prove me wrong, whatever.

Mercury: Ethylmercury is usually contained in flu vaccines, not methylmercury (which is in fish and can cause neurological damage with high exposure). Both types of mercury are eliminated from the body but ethylmercury has a faster rate of elimination. There is no proof that ethylmercury causes autism.

Formaldehyde: Your own body produces formaldehyde from metabolism. The formaldehyde in vaccines exists in a very very small amount and this is likely harmless (there is no evidence to prove otherwise).

Glyphosate: Go read up about the way vaccines are prepared, this chemical wouldn't have made it to the final product with all the processing involved. Person who found this in vaccine likely had contaminated specimens. 

Aluminum: Present in many foods, water, you name it, newborns get a higher dose from being breast fed. Negligible amounts in vaccines, not even near close enough to do any damage.

MSG: Some people may have a short-term reaction to MSG but this is not supported by evidence. There's no good evidence that it is harmful. It is only present in a couple of vaccines (flu and adenovirus).

Drinking human blood: Who? What? Where? Blood for transfusion is processed and checked for diseases, as well as matched to the recipient. I hope this was a bamboozle. Please proceed to r/occult.",k9kyrf,2020-12-09 06:15:32

How does this prove anything? The fact that a product has R&D costs doesn't mean it isn't profitable

>vaccines are free so they don't make any of the money back or any kind of profit.

This is false, vaccines are not free, but they are often covered by insurance, in these cases the insurance company (or the government in places with government insurance) pays the vaccine manufacturer instead of the patient, so the manufacturer still makes a profit

What actually changed my mind was the fact that when I was trying to find statistics to prove to peopel that vaccines were bad I found that they actually aren't as dangerous as I had thought and were often quite helpful, however there is such big problem with misinformation on **both sides** that I made an entire post just to try and debunk many of the fallacious arguments I have seen about vaccines [https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineDiscussion/comments/haglrv/common\_vaccine\_fallacies\_to\_avoid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineDiscussion/comments/haglrv/common_vaccine_fallacies_to_avoid/)",k8hzym,2020-12-07 16:53:03

Perfectly understandable as to why the vaccine has been fast tracked, and part of me is glad it was. But I'm going to wait to see what happens with the first wave of volunteers before I step up myself.",k7p6yg,2020-12-07 11:47:20

"I am pro-vax but often label as anti-vax because of my stances of ""not all vaccines are created equal"", ""informed consent to medication cannot be given without first being informed"", ""right to bodily autonomy"", and lastly, the most controversial one, ""herd immunity and other circumstances can emancipate one from getting medicated""  


**1 - not all vaccines are created equal - pretty self-explanatory**  
Example being - OPV and it's relationship to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis & vaccine-derived Poliovirus outbreak.  
Or - mRNA vaccine is a science that has not been approved for use in humans up until 2020, has not been peer-reviewed on the efficacy, and a complete lack of information on medium to longer-term data on potential side-effects.  
Or - TB vaccines, which only decreases the risk in Children of getting the infection by 20% and the risk of infection turning into active disease by nearly 60%.   


**2 - informed consent to medication cannot be given without first being informed - also pretty self-explanatory**  
Ideally at least to be a basic understanding.  
Even if one chooses ignorance, that's their freedom; but please don't go around promoting said ignorance, that's annoying.  


**3 - the right to bodily autonomy - also pretty self-explanatory**  
Some might argue vaccination as national security, which is fair.  
Personally, I see it as a slippery slope.  


**4 - herd immunity and other circumstances can emancipate one from getting medicated**  
Other circumstances would include the reasons why most countries do not have Japanese encephalitis or Tuberculosis vaccines are part of our routine vaccination.  


Herd immunity is a sensitive topic - the basic premise is - if almost everyone has immunity from vaccination...

From a personal standpoint, if I decided I am safe enough, I can choose to not medicate, as with any disease.  
From a public health standpoint, the average Joe poses a statistically insignificant risk to those who are not immune.  


Take measle for example.

[https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)  
""In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year. Also each year, among reported cases, an estimated 400 to 500 people died.""  
Note - the population of the USA was 189.2 million in 1963.

[https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)  
We got 3243 confirmed cases of measles from 2010-2019, with 2020 having 13 confirmed cases so far.  
Note - if we remove 2019's data as an outlier, we end up with around 197 cases of measles per year from 2010-2020

[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death)  
We have about 17 measles deaths between 1995 to 2015.  
Note - I am sure this data did not include SSPE deaths, which would triple this number.  
Note - put things in perspective, about 43 reported lightning fatalities per year in the USA.
