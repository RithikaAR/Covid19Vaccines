"It is not normal, this does not mean it's working and yes you should be very concerned. So many ppl having reactions like this (and MUCH worse) but don't expect to hear about it, at least not followed with every sort of ridiculous excuse you can imagine. Do not get your second shot if you value life.",nqqgqh,2021-06-02 21:10:15
"Yes, it is common. Unfortunately this thread is infiltrated with worthless antivaxx d bags. You have far more to worry about crossing the street- that is statistical fact. I know it's disconcerting, but swollen glands, nodes, etc. are part of a healthy immune response.",nqqgqh,2021-06-02 23:52:16
It is normal or not? I don’t understand what you say,nqqgqh,2021-06-02 20:06:36
Though this reaction is written on astra sheet I signed so I’m not very worried about it I just don’t understand why it doesn’t disappear after 2 weeks,nqqgqh,2021-06-02 21:13:26

Dude you're stupid,nqqgqh,2021-06-03 01:50:24
"Hmmm...stupid to not rush out to take an experimental vaccine which may alter DNA, and produces spike proteins which we still don't fully understand what they do long term, and has shown to cause more adverse events in 5 months than all other vaccines did in the prev 10 years....ok yea, no comment dude. Take this thing at your own uninformed risk",nqqgqh,2021-06-03 02:00:45
"1) it is not rushed
2) it does not alter your DNA
3) no long term issues

You're misinformed. I already took it and I'm perfectly fine. And will be. It's simple science and facts.",nqqgqh,2021-06-03 02:14:37
"Ok glad to hear that, but that does not mean anything...let me know in 3 years how you feel, did you know that nobody who has taken this shot has lived that long? FYI typical vaccines take 10-15 years to get to market because of long term studies and drug interaction testing etc. This one had none of that, thus the warp speed label. The experimental status ends in 2023 if you were curious, although I doubt you were since that is an inconvenient fact for your current situation. I am sorry too, the media has hidden so much about this in an effort to scare everyone into unquestionably taking it.",nqqgqh,2021-06-03 03:21:01
"Wrong wrong and wrong. I linked the source below. You linked no sources and I bet the ones you do will be from forums from random people. You listed the most basic and retarded excuses which says a lot about you.

Myth: Vaccine creation was rushed, so the vaccines may not be safe.

In this case, speed didn’t sacrifice safety. The exceptional speed of COVID-19 vaccine development is due to years of prior research on other viruses, including coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Scientists weren’t starting their research from scratch.
As for safety, rigorous safety and efficacy standards are set by the FDA for these (and all) vaccines. Each COVID-19 vaccine candidate has had to meet these standards.
Here, in a nutshell, are the reasons behind the extraordinary speed of COVID-19 vaccine development:

Urgency and prioritization. The record scope and scale of the pandemic created a unique sense of urgency and a shifting of priorities.

Knowledge gained from previous research. Pharmaceutical companies had already been conducting vaccine research using this technology.

Thousands tested. More than 70,000 people from diverse backgrounds participated in the clinical trials.

Production started before formal approval. Because of the urgency of the situation and the evidence supporting vaccine safety and effectiveness, the U.S. government provided funding for vaccine manufacture before FDA approval. This reduced lag time between approval and distribution.

Emergency use authorization. Scientists needed only two months of post-vaccination follow-up instead of the standard six.

Myth: The mRNA vaccines will alter your DNA.

The technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is mRNA. Think of mRNA as an instruction manual for your body on how to make a specific protein — in this case, a small part of the “spike” protein that appears on the virus’ surface. This protein CANNOT cause infection, but it does teach your body to respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus, should you encounter it.
In addition, the mRNA never actually enters the nucleus of your cells, where your DNA resides. Because the two don’t share the same space, the mRNA doesn’t interact with your DNA and therefore can’t alter it. Your cells break down and get rid of the mRNA quickly.

"I put this info on yesterday. 

My friend is an actor on a set in Canada. He hangs out with people in that group. They moved to shoot in New Mexico. He got both doses, and 2 months later he was in the hospital with serious lung issues...3 weeks he had this. He said it was horrible getting it. 

Another friend in point Loma had it 2 times but the second time was light, but with bad sinus issues. He just thought it w as another day to him.

They are both fine now. I am not. Hope this helps you! 

Hey its changing now with masks as well.

TODAY A guy from Amazon Prime was delivering to my doctors bldg today. I'm on crutches and I was getting in this tiny elevator. He tried to get in with me. It's like a 3x4 elevator. I put my crutch up in the air, and asked him to please don a mask. He replied that the virus is a hoax and that if you just believe in GOD you wont get Covid. He refuses to wear a mask on the job. Kudos to him.  I still wear a mask with delivery guys in tight areas. If we are outside, I dont care about it so much. Just dont  sneeze, cough, or spit on me...lol

He seemed a little off. But hes the reason people like us have to still watch out for a bit. Alot of it is common sense now though I think. 

No, you are not invincible from the shot. Yes people get it again and after the shot. Symtoms vary,

"I know a couple of people who tested positive after the vaccine but one was asymptomatic (she went to get tested because her kids tested positive) and the other one, who is an older person, had a very mild case. I hope this helps. Good luck!",nq8c9j,2021-06-02 13:53:28
No if your young and healthy then you don’t need it,nq8c9j,2021-06-02 20:11:43
"Look, my friend in point Loma killed his girlfriends dad when he infected the entire family at Christmas. Covid killed him. His lungs  became a fluid soaked nightmare. He was healthy. He tested before Christmas, because he felt sick, but he didnt really believe in covid, so he went anyway. On the 27th, he was positive . So he found out AFTER Christmas. Her mom was really very sick. Like 2 people seemed immune out of 9 for dinner

My best friend in queens NY, went to his uncle and aunts house for thanksgivings. His uncle's kid showed up with her boyfriend and the mom came. The mom  had just finished taking care of a person with covid. She didnt know she had covid as she was asymptomatic and thought she was safe. Everyone got covid except again a couple of people. The father lived but was in the hospital with pneumonia. The mom died from complications from covid (her 1 lung she had left could not keep her alive). That was not necessarily covid. But I have probably ten stories, all similar. Some ignorant for like some of you say covid isn't real, when you know it is real. 

But the point is you can believe there is covid, but you dont feel the vaccination should go in YOUR  body...not yet anyway. And that is fine too. But please...really. it is not real? Where you like? Rifle Colorado? Population 153?  Lol.  It is real. I've seem people really sick and I've known other people who have died from covid. Not other underlying ailments. 

You still dont have to take that shot yet. The matrices that connected everyone are broken. That why we dont see alot of covid cases. That part is resolved. I'm not sure why the government is paying people to get the vaccination. I am pro vaccination. But with what happened to me...still a month after. I'm not recommending it anymore. Not until I get an mri and I know the cause of my tennis elbow of my ass, with pain going down to my ankle.

Covid is real. You can catch it from others. Yes It's harder now to catch because its alot harder to find! But  You can kill someone with your ignorance. My friend did, and hes way in denial about that fact...kinda like some of you will be. 

Anyway I would wait it out. Right now maybe they are fixing stuff with the what they find out from out the data related to people hurting, that thinks there is a relation to there pain. Some are just coincendences. Correlation does t necessarily mean causation.


But the Corona virus is real. Next thing you know, you will be saying we are in the matrix and you are Neo😜",nq8c9j,2021-06-03 04:25:30

Yes. Look up breakthrough cases. They’re trying to sugar coat it, but yes you’ll get covid. If you got it now and survived thank God for that immune system. Don’t put any more poison from big pharmacy in it. 🙂 God bless.",nq8c9j,2021-06-02 14:23:32

"Omg- You are so idiotic. I know an 18 year old that died. And my friends 16 yr old was really sick and her lung is now messed up with scar tissue. Plus she got her family sick. She was sneaking out to her boyfriend who was chilling with all his homies, and they all gave it to all the cool kids man. It took one cute girl to get them ALL sick. You are so ridiculous lil' one.

"What date was this ? I know at one point the cdc announced that they wanted to stop tracking these instances. Which bothers me.

But there will surely be side effects when the body tries to fight the poison.

They are just deaths REPORTED by people who had recently received from vaccine and died(and with those numbers that's about .0017%). Vaers accepts all reports of deaths. But it has to be looked into and investigated if they are actually related at all to the vaccine and I wasn't able to see anything that indicated that it was proven. It looks like the J&J may be the only vaccine that could possibly be linked to a couple deaths due to blood clot issues. Which is incredibly rare (1 in a million chance) and they are working the kinks out now so that doesn't happen again.

If you are intersted where I am trying to go with this, or my situation and have input, please read my Sub- i explain what's wrong with me there.

If there are short term effects, there are long term effects. Simple as that. And to think they'd be telling all the long term effects, or that they know them all is foolish.

[Here's an article about how they count covid death rates.](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/how-are-covid-19-deaths-counted-it-s-complicated) If anything experts believe the numbers are under reported rather than over inflated. 

We have no idea if having had covid is just as good as the vaccine. There is absolutely no proof of this and we have proof that people have contracted covid twice.

"It HAS had FDA testing. It is FDA approved. It just went through EUA, which is the exact same testing as a regular FDA approval, just streamlined to do several tests at the same time instead of sequentially.

And you're completely ignoring the fact that you may be avoiding the 1 in a million or billion chance of something happening to you with the vaccine. But you are then taking the chance that you contract covid and have that effect you. And the odds of covid giving you a serious complication or killing you is extremely higher than the vaccine. If you're playing an odds game, vaccine is a thousand times safer than not taking the vaccine. Unless you want to live on an island and never see another person again to avoid contracting it. 

I am glad that you did decide to get it. And some people do have horrible short term side effects, but I believe it's absolutely worth it, to avoid getting and spreading covid. I got off pretty lucky. I just had a moderate headache for a day and that's it. But I know some other people who felt worse, but they're fine now. Getting an MRI sounds kind of nuts to me, but whatever, you do you.

Also there are coincidences in the world. You can't just ignore that, specially when millions of people are doing something, it's statistically bound to happen.

" Luv u- Thank you for correcting me and for your information. Every bit helps.. Yes the FDA was forced to push a not fully tested vaccination on the public due to the pandemic. I apologize, I've been ib pain and not sleeping alot. Even if the FDA did 'approve' it was not tested to the fullest extent most vaccination testing go through. Not even close. Hence the J&J issues.They needed alot more variables in the testing. We all know that. 

There are very likely persons with non death random medical  issues,  thinking they may have contracted whatever at the time of their vaccination, and are there any other persons like them with issues? We are here for that. Where can they go to discuss it? Here I hope...
Somewhere on Reddit anyway.

I was perfectly healthy until my nerves and muscles started hurting me on 5/4. They hurt so bad, pressing into my legs and right buttock. And now 3weeks later, I cant really walk right. the Cat shows my skeletal is fine in that area and they didnt say I was out of alignment. And this happened over only 5 days. I just cant walk without Neurontin.  So have your opinion. I am kool with it.  which is exactly why this is a discussion...and I appreciate your opinion here. I dont even know why I am sick, I've seen others feeling this way, hence my discussion..

On the coincidence thing.... I did touch base on that too. I agree. Every single person who thinks the vaccine hurt them may be wrong. But what if 10 percent are real. I mean we are the Guinea pigs right? Billions of  Humans are literally the real testing ground here and now. And you cannot deny that either. 

In relation to your opinion of my MRI, you dont know what you are talking about. But again, I appreciate your opinion. But I'm at level 9.2 pain without neurotin... and this has been progressing since my whole  back got temporary stiff after the 2nd shot  Then after 4 days on the 2nd dose, moved to me lower back and my right buttock. And it hasn't stopped feeling like an attack on my nerves. Yes it may be a coincidence. But for no reason I feel like my nerves are aching and I can not support my weight on my right leg almost at all after a min. I feel throbbing thru my nerve now.There is nothing broken according to the ER and my doc told me that I needed an MRI from my PCD to fix it. What...you dont believe in an MRI now? Because that would be pretty ignorant. I'm not sure where you drew your conclusion that an MRI is 'nuts'. Your wrong. MRIs save lives. 

 In my opinion after you read this, I would be pushing for me to get an MRI. I am in my 50 with sudden nerve issues. I feel partially paralyzed overnight? Im saying my nerves hurt. And 4 doctors cant determine why. I have never felt like this. The pain. Then I read this below. And I felt it relates to me somehow. Maybe I dont even have anything wrong in your mind? And Maybe it's all just a coincendence right? Even so, even if my symptoms are not from the vaccination, I still need an MRI. So that shows how your train of thought works with things. And I disagree with you.

Also if there are unknown short term effects from this vaccination, why cant there still be unknown long term effect waiting in the wings. Your arguement is weak and maybe others who are sick like I am should form and give  their own opinion, or share their experiences good and bad. See below for a link to a news article. I've read about alot of people's nerves aching lately after a month. And maybe that all an illusion as well. Maybe all my kids seeing me in a chair, for no reason in pain every day is ok too. But i was fine on 5/1/2021. The day before my vaccination. So coincidence or not I'm posting information. Take it how you want it. I'm so happy you were only temporarily affected. But that is just not the case with everyone else. If their are short term effects, chances are there are long term. Its ridiculous for anyone to think otherwise until we know.

I want the vaccine to be safe and I believe it's important to be incredible transparent and look into all cases of side effects from it. But so far 400 million have been vaccinated with extremely good results.

- The first one is actually a pro-covid vaccine article, so I don't know what you're trying to tell me with that one. It's basically say anti-vaxxers and false news on the vaccine causing harm is hurting the vaccine campaign. It's a mostly positive article for the vaccine. 

- The second article that talks about heart inflammation also states most importantly that they still don't know with certainty that it's linked to the vaccine. It says this: ""At the moment, regulators don’t see an indication that the vaccine caused these cases."" 

They are investigating. It's also extremely rare and can be treated. Also I've read about that health condition and you can be at risk of contracting that if you catch Covid as well. So if there was a link, you're actually at a risk of getting the inflammation with or without the vaccine, since the virus can give it to you as well. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009191

- The third article is also about Guillain-Barre Sydrome so, basically same thing I said about article 2. You're at risk of contracting this if you get covid and there is still no proof that the boy in this article got this syndrome from the vaccine. It even says: ""Dr. Sims said the condition could be a coincidence."" These things are bound to happen when 100s of millions people get vaccinated. A doctor died soon after vaccination and of course articles came out wanting to blame the virus, but upon further investigation they discovered his death had nothing to do with the vaccine.

I guess I do want to add that I'm not saying that maybe there can't be a connection between GBS and the vaccine. But it's important to not jump to conclusions before research is done and data is collected. And there is no evidence yet showing the link. Yeah it could change. But we don't know. And again you're at risk of catching that with covid. So to me, personally, it's worth getting vaccinated. It's also pretty treatable.

- The fourth one, with the paralysis is a freak situation that we don't know is attributed to the vaccine. The thing is over 400 million people have been vaccinated and this is the ONLY case I've seen where something like this happened. If it was from the vaccine there has to be more than 1 case. That's way too many people getting vaccinated for it not to happen to at least several people. 


I'm glad you didn't post more than 4 articles though cause I don't really have the time to read that many.",noihq0,2021-06-02 01:34:48

We've had issues temporary and ongoing, a month later. Pain Eczema, almost all of us had headaches, fatigue and some soreness. you name it. Almost all was temporary. Or seems temporary. But always call for help if you are hurting. Your not as old as you think you are, and you dont always have to take care of yourself. Your not imagining the pain, and your parents will just take your side and help you.

It's very odd unless its GBS which I could just have, but is also listed as something being g researched as a long term side affect, or a coincendence. I am sick of all the coincendences.

"That’s not true at all. The sheer number of everyone getting the viruses means that “coincidences” are going to happen because normal medical things continue to happen. Remember correlation does not equal causation.

Two things- 1. You slipped a disc-unrelated to the vaccine completely. You just happened to do so after the vaccine. (I bent down at Christmas).  I see you’re getting an MRI. That should see if that’s the case. 

Or #2 You immune system reacted and everything inflamed. When that happens your nerves get really irritated can cause sciatic pain. Can you talk to a doctor about getting steroids?  I have an over active inflammatory response and that helped me quite a bit.",noxymx,2021-06-01 04:54:35
"Yea...I agree with some of what you think. But it sucks for the people who may get sick and we werent given factual information to make a good judgement . You will see . Only time will tell. I didnt think that correlation equals causation. I didnt even state it. I am simy pointing out that there are facts that are not being easy to find. And even if the cases are rare. It's possible. And if I go off neurontin and I dont even move, my nerves hurt me. You just talk common sense and want me to say I dont have sudden nerve issues. Well see ok?

I understand your pain completely.  I have a chronic illness and chronic pain.  I injured my back and sciatic nerve and it was -nothing- compared to what I normally feel.  I've given birth to a child and it didn't touch the way my leg/hip felt and the shocking/shooting pain.

Another thing that may help you is a TENS unit.  They are pretty cheap off of Amazon now.

Look everyone, I believe in the vaccine, but I'm writing this anyway, because I spent 7 hours in the ER, getting a cat scan and xrays. Now they say I need an MRI to look at my nerves.That needs scheduling. So I will follow up here later. Then the ER ust discharged me. They gave me nerve blockers, without knowing what is wrong. Like a bad disk, or hip. The doc explained to me that he checked me for life and death situation, made sure I was ok, gave me stuff for the nerve pain. I would have to continue with Neuorontin and talk to my Primary care doc. And it's time to leave. So I left.  I went to urgent care for a steroid shot today, 3 days later. It did nothing to help me so far. So even thou this all may be a coincidence. I was literally fine with no pain In my body before the 1st shot. I got the vaccine, my muscles tightened, and I've been in pain ever since that. If you leave this post up, you may find that other people may be having this issue. I need to be clear to the mods and kens and Karens.I do not write this to discourage people from getting the shot. Because I am pro shot. I have parents, and grandparents and the risk of killing them outweighs my fears of the shot. 

But now I cant put pressure on my right leg without Neurontin or I get extreme pain. Honestly I hope its hip replacement or something, but the ER did a CAT, plus xrays, and he says my hip is fine. I have never hurt my hip. So I fell asleep writing this. I just woke up at 4am just now in extreme pain in my nerve in my right leg aching, for no reason. So I am writing this.

I have read of people having this problem, so we should find out if anyone else has had NERVE issues. I dont know why I am sick. And I hope it is logical when they find out. But for now, they are scratching their heads and throwing medicine at me to block my pain, which is working. I just dont know if I want to block my pain as much as stop this pain.

"Not really. It's illogical and NOT  factual if you are thinking that way. 

I could get Covid and sneeze in a room or cough, not even k owing that I have it, and people I love or dont would not be safe because they got the shot. I know people who got the vaccination and ended up in the hospital 2 months later because they are an actor on a set in Canada, thinking they are untouchable. He said it was the worst hes ever felt. Almost 3 weeks in a hospital when hes only around 40. 

Besides I had to get it first to pave the way, and my dad would not see us inside any bldg until we all were vaccinated. I'm 50. Hes 78

😜. Yea I still hope it's not in relation to vaccinations and it's a coincendence.

"Please scroll down to my link to an article I found after hardcore searching. Im trying to get this out there, because I'm being affected. My life changed in 4 days. There were 13 of us, split between Pfizer and moderna. 1 person got a huge rash at the injection site for Pfizer. That was it.  But the moderna shot was really hard on 3 of us, relative to our muscles or fatigue in comparison to Pfizer . I've been having nerve issues, specifically my right sciatica up to my right buttock...my muscles were tight  from the second shot. But my right buttock was like a rock,, towards the top. It locked up like that. It was like I have a permanent cramp which hurts all the time. If I walk after about 20 steps I want to collapse from the pain. I worked that knot out, 5 days later it stopped. I still have it come and go when I walk. So I stop and lean on something to 'stretch'the pain out of my leg, or I use crutches, which I now have all the time. I've been having for lack of any other way to explain it, weird hard aches from my nerves.. I received the 2nd Moderna shot on 5/2, this started on 5/6. In Euroupe there is an article regarding GBS being a side effect.

Look everyone, I believe in the vaccine, but I'm writing this anyway, because I spent 7 hours in the ER, getting a cat scan and xrays. Now they say I need an MRI to look at my nerves.That needs scheduling. So I will follow up here later. Then the ER ust discharged me. They gave me nerve blockers, without knowing what is wrong. Like a bad disk, or hip. The doc explained to me that he checked me for life and death situation, made sure I was ok, gave me stuff for the nerve pain. I would have to continue with Neuorontin and talk to my Primary care doc. And it's time to leave. So I left.  I went to urgent care for a steroid shot today, 3 days later. It did nothing to help me so far. So even thou this all may be a coincidence. I was literally fine with no pain In my body before the 1st shot. I got the vaccine, my muscles tightened, and I've been in pain ever since that. If you leave this post up, you may find that other people may be having this issue. I need to be clear to the mods and kens and Karens.I do not write this to discourage people from getting the shot. Because I am pro shot. I have parents, and grandparents and the risk of killing them outweighs my fears of the shot. 

But now I cant put pressure on my right leg without Neurontin or I get extreme pain. Honestly I hope its hip replacement or something, but the ER did a CAT, plus xrays, and he says my hip is fine. I have never hurt my hip. So I fell asleep writing this. I just woke up at 4am just now in extreme pain in my nerve in my right leg aching, for no reason. So I am writing this. In 1 week I have 0 change. Every day is extreme pain, and the doctors dont have any idea what is wrong. Anyone have any comments? And Mods, I would appreciate it if you not delete this post. I have read of people having this problem, so we should find out if anyone else has had NERVE issues. I dont know why I am sick. And I hope it is logical when they find out. But for now, they are scratching their heads and throwing medicine at me to block my pain, which is working. I just dont know if I want to block my pain as much as stop this pain. My entire lower body is aching from my nerves atm. Anybody else have nerve symptoms? I really need guidance. I have never had pain like this in my hip or leg in my life until now.

T1D is caused by the body attacking the pancreas and killing it off so it can’t make insulin any longer. It mostly happens in childhood but can happen in adulthood.

"Why are we not vaccinating teenagers and children from a known deadly virus with a vaccine that has proven to be very safe?

&#x200B;

This ""potentially harmful in the longterm"" statement is without evidence. Millions of people have received COVID vaccines with harmful side effects in the 1's of millions at the most. There is no evidence of any long term negative effects with the vaccine.",nn43zl,2021-05-28 19:30:19
"Because the vaccines aren't potentially harmful. They have been proven to be incredibly safe. And the virus they protect us against IS incredibly harmful (well to many, maybe not all). Just so you know there are children who have died from covid and have been been affected severely. Some of which may have permanent damage. When you have a safe vaccine that can prevent the risk of your child from getting Covid and maybe having it be severe or something bad happen, why wouldn't you do it? Also kids can spread it to more vulnerable people. There are some who can't get vaccinated because they are immune compromised. And it may be awhile before we give it to babies if we ever do. So it's important to protect those in the vulnerable population.

The ground work for the covid vaccines and SARS have been studied and worked on for years before the pandemic even hit. This all seems incredibly fast because luckily we had a head start. Over 400 million people have been vaccinated and the results are incredible in terms of safety. The chance of long term risks from the vaccine make no theoretical sense since the mRNA(for Pfizer and Moderna) leaves your body quickly. But Covid can cause long term side effects. 

Do real research on how the vaccine works from actual scientists, immunologists, and other experts in the field (not from anti-vaxxers who make shit up and are typically incredibly unqualified to discuss that stuff). When I did that research I felt safe enough to take the vaccine while pregnant. I feel I made the right decision to protect my baby from covid. My 14 year old nephew just got vaccinated recently and he's doing great.",nn43zl,2021-05-28 21:45:21
"1) Because they have a much lower rate of complications, and a MUCH MUCH lower rate of death.  But that rate is not zero, in either case, and this preventative vaccine is many times safer than allowing them to be at unnecessary risk for death from covid, even though that risk is low.  
2) Because children are potential risk factors for their teachers, doctors, dentists, family members, grocery clerks, and neighbors.  The more people that are vaccinated (including kids) the lower the risk is for everyone.  5% of people who get the vaccine (at least) can still get covid.  100% of the people with some kinds of autoimmune disease and transplant recipients can still get covid, despite being vaccinated (because the treatment they receive renders the vaccine ineffective).  Vaccinating the kids who they have to be around makes everyone safer

3) The more covid is circulating in the environment, the higher the risks of a disadvantageous mutation.  Imagine if one of the variants that's already more deadly, AND more communicable, also mutates in a way that activates the immune system in a way that's more deadly for children.  H1N1 was far worse for children and young adults than older folks.  It's entirely possible that allowing covid to continue circulating widely could result in a mutation that makes it deadly for children.  It's in EVERYONE'S interest, including children, to reduce the amount of circulating virus before that happens.",nn43zl,2021-05-29 00:59:23

"Kids do get effected by this virus. There’s some who don’t get knocked down at all like the older population or some who do.

There’s also kids who don’t wear their mask, especially those who are neurodivergent and can spread it to others. A lot of kids are good about this but some can not wear a mask.",nn43zl,2021-05-29 21:01:33
"Because we think we know more about the vaccine than we do about the virus.  


Kids often get chicken pox, and then as adults they may get shingles because of their first infection with varicella zoster. Women may contract HPV and years later get cervical cancer. Could this coronavirus give a similar delayed effect? Possibly. We also really don't know the long-term effects of these vaccines (it's impossible to know without time). We think we understand more about the vaccine because we understood enough to create it and tested it to have it work, so we understand the mechanism quite well.   


Personally, I think most people under 18 should be at the far back of the line (unless they have underlying health issues) though since we are still in the pandemic and other countries have to be vaccinated quickly to stop death and possible vaccine resistant mutations.",nn43zl,2021-05-31 08:13:32
"Older people have higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus and lower risk of vaccine complications.  
With younger people it's the opposite.  
Why take the risk (other than social pressure)?

"The virus is not  deadly to people below the age of 70 in moderately good health.  There is no evidence of longterm effects because nobody has had these drugs in their system for more than 6 months. We cannot possibly know of they are safe.  

There is little to no benefit to injecting children or teenagers and the risks of doing so are completely unknown",nn43zl,2021-05-31 19:21:22
"If proven to be incredibly safe, then why aren’t  the vaccines fully approved by FDA?  How could the long term safety already be known? There is no way to know yet and I’ve chosen to wait until more is known. Good luck to you.",nn43zl,2021-05-30 13:28:08
"They were actually only vetted by healthy individuals. Anyone with anything from autoimmune diseases, history of cancer, diabetes, and so on were excluded from the trial. Unfortunately there are 10,000 of reactions ranging from moderate to severe that have been public all logged by the CDC. 

It needs to be noted that many autoimmune groups noted a flare in their symptoms post vaccine. The issue with this is many auto immune diseases can take years to diagnose. So if someone who is not being managed by medicine, because they don’t know what is going on with them yet, receives a vaccine and experiences “a flair” without knowing they are having one, they don’t have the meds to mange said symptoms and body responses which can be dangerous.

Secondly the CDC IS investigating why there have been so many myocarditis cases post covid vaccine and it’s mainly happening in males below 30.

So are they safe for the MAJORITY of people? Yes, but that’s also saying “well I didn’t have a bad experience when I got the vax so I don’t want to hear about yours’” When we victim blame it also doesn’t push for accountability or a resolution but rather common acceptance that it’s ok for some people to be hurt by meds as long as the majority aren’t.",nn43zl,2021-05-28 23:41:25

"""And aren't teenagers and under with incredibly low deaths/hospitalizations?"" yes, but they may have grandparents or people they live with that are high risk. It also doesn't take into account any future mutations that may affect children more.

"Phase 3 trials with Pfizer started about a year ago so we have close to 12 months of study on this specific vaccine. We also have a few decades worth of data on mRNA vaccines. There is benefit because not only can they spread the virus but they can die from it (MISC-C). 

You make a lot of definite statements with a little knowledge of the facts. Dont get the vaccine if you dont want to, but stop trying to scare people with false assumptions",nn43zl,2021-05-31 20:21:45
"You don't really understand how this vaccine and the FDA is working. The FDA approved Emergency Use Authorization. The only reason why it doesn't have full approval has nothing to do with the vaccine and it's safety. It has to do with streamlining the process and doing several steps at the same time instead of one at a time. No step was forgotten, EUA and FDA approval have to pass the same testing process. The FDA has found the vaccine safe and did approve it.

[This link explains it very simply](https://vaccine.unchealthcare.org/science/vaccine-approval/whats-the-difference-between-fda-emergency-use-authorization-and-fda-approval/)

"That's how trials work for ALL vaccines. They always start testing on healthy individuals before they allow it for more at risk groups. That's what they are doing with children too. First they give it to the adults to see that it's safe before they allow children to have it. We do trials for healthy adults. All looks good so all adults can get it. Then over 400 million adults have been vaccinated with really good results. So then did a trial with children 12+ and that went well, so they approved it for children. The next step will be for younger children to go through the testing stage and then it will get approved for them too. 

For people with autoimmune issues, they were included in some trials although they were limited and the CDC is transparent about that. It's completely up to those individuals as to whether they want to take the vaccine or not, they aren't being forced. Usually with these groups it's not that the vaccine is harmful at all, just that it may not actually protect them as well as people with healthy immune systems. Also there is no live virus in the vaccines, so that really takes away there being a risk for these individuals to get vaccinated. 

[Here's CDC info on the vaccine and autoimmune diseases.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html) 

With myocarditis cases, first we don't know if it was the vaccine that caused that. Second, they said the cases appear to be mild and tend to responded well to treatment. And if it was the vaccine it's about a .001% chance of that happening. Also contracting covid-19 is known to be able to give you myocarditis as well. So... You're kind of at risk either way. But a very low risk. The CDC thinks it's safer for people to take the vaccine than any tiny risk of getting myocarditis. 

https://www.healthychildren.org/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Does-the-COVID-19-vaccine-cause-myocarditis-in-teens-and-young-people.aspx

And you have to remember that people who are immune compromised or have other major health issues are the ones who are at most at risk of getting severe Covid and dying. I'd say it's well worth the risk of getting vaccinated. A lot of immune compromised people have been vaccinated and the vaccine has not hurt them. It's a lot safer than getting covid. 

Always remember, choosing to get the vaccine isn't the only health risk you face. You're taking a risk not getting the vaccine as well. You have to weigh which one is riskier. Even for children who are less likely to get severe covid, there is still a risk of that happening. Or for them [to develop a long term side effects](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-05-children-long-term-effects-covid-.html). The vaccine feels far safer than contracting covid.",nn43zl,2021-05-30 18:28:03

Ok so the thing about vaccines teying to get rid of the disease instead of creating immunity....immunity is one if the biggest factors in getting rid of the disease. Its why polio and smallpox are virtually unheard of. Generations before us had to start out getting it so that they wouldn't contract it and give it to others.,nmt7b2,2021-05-30 07:28:28
"So the vaccine isn’t a typical one, the COVID vaccines are mRNA vaccines, which essentially teach your body/immune system to make a certain protein that triggers an immune response from the body to fight off the virus by making antibodies. First of all, mRNA (messenger RNA) is just a genetic material that tells the body how to make specific proteins. It basically teaches our body how to fight the infection. The flu vaccine works more like what you’ve described, where it exposes you to a small bit of the virus that your body fights off in order to learn how to fight it off when you actually get exposed to it. The COVID mRNA vaccine teaches the body to do this without exposing you to the virus. Also, with the mRNA vaccines, once the mRNA that is injected into the body has done its job your cells break it down and get rid of it (it being the mRNA). And it never enters the nucleus of the cell (where DNA is kept) so it doesn’t alter your DNA or anything, which some people believe it does (even though it doesn’t). The COVID vaccine, like many vaccines, isn’t 100% effective, and you can still get COVID once you’re fully vaccinated, although the chances of such are significantly lower than for an unvaccinated person. But the good news is that if you’re vaccinated and still happen to get the virus, the symptoms are much less severe because your body is way better prepared to fight the virus, so at least if you get the virus the chances of it having a serious or fatal effect on you are extremely slim. 

Sorry that no one else in these responses has actually explained it, most of these responses were pretty rude IMO. People could’ve just explained it for you instead of leaving snarky comments.",nmt7b2,2021-05-31 00:35:47

So basically it's making the covid virus more of a normal thing in the body ?,nmt7b2,2021-05-29 05:17:30
"Honestly the starting point for that very thing has to be with what we are doing now. This is a very new virus among humans, it will take time. All we can do in this moment is vaccinate and try to create some immunity. Further down the road with enough time and more.study there may be a one shot cure for the later mutations. Hopefully millions more won't have to die first. If enough are willing to be the first generation to take it (like with the polio vax and smallpox vax) that may happen.",nmt7b2,2021-05-30 07:31:52
Vaccines do not fight the virus. They just give your T killer cells information about the virus. The T killer cells then know which cells are infected.,nmt7b2,2021-05-29 06:32:24

I had PVCs for one month straight beginning two weeks after my second dose of moderna. My brother had pfizer and similar side effects. I believe this is 100% a latent side effect of the vaccine. My doctors also seemed clueless and disinterested unfortunately and no structural or other abnormalities were found.,nmpren,2021-05-28 06:03:44
"I searched for this subreddit to looking to see if anyone else had this experience. My mother began having similar issues about two weeks after her 2nd vaccine. She’s never had these issues before and is waking up in the middle of the night with palpitations/racing heart. She wore a heart monitor the past two weeks The doctors followed up with her today and want to put her on beta blockers. They used words like “afib”’ “ventricular rapid beats”, “premature ventricular contractions” along with other things I don’t quite understand. She’s 65 and has never had these issues before. I’ve heard it mentioned by other people at some point, so figured I would dig into it for her and check all potential scenarios. She doesn’t want to go on beta blockers but I’m sure I can get her to do it if it’s absolutely necessary. She doesn’t like taking medications, but a heart issue is a serious matter.",nmpren,2021-05-29 00:21:22
You’re not alone there’s a lot of people with symptoms like that after the covid vaccine. I’m one of them I got the moderna vaccine last dose was in March and I’m slowly improving but I still get weird stuff like severe anxiety episodes and trouble sleeping. Heart palpitations I think I  get also but the doctors are clueless.,nmpren,2021-06-01 15:29:13

Mine are much less frequent and feel much less significant, like sometimes I barely notice them. And now they just happen when I am very tired.",nmpren,2021-06-01 20:03:50
"My side effects were different but I wonder if the cause is similar. I had paresthesia in my hands and feet that developed a week after my second shot and slowly went away after two weeks. It comes back randomly. My immunologist said that it’s likely due to inflammation caused by my immune system trying to fight off the vaccine. He gave me a steroid shot and all my symptoms went away (until it wore off). Maybe it’s inflammation? Idk, not a medical doctor but figured it may be helpful.",nmo9vp,2021-05-28 05:05:01

"Then why do so, you have antibodies and have demonstrated that your body successfully fought the virus before?  Really bizzare behavior",nmldvg,2021-05-31 19:22:36
Antibody response is a lot higher in vaccinated individuals than people that had natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.  The waning effect is lower which would lead to longer immunity.,nmldvg,2021-05-31 19:28:54

"1. We don't know what the minimal infectious dose is.  If you think you do, post a link to the study that shows this.

"It is bizzare that people have bought into the concept that a drug which targets one small portion for the virus could be more protective then your body identifying and destroying the wild virus.

The immune system in any remotely healthy child or adult is perfectly capable of managing the covid virus. 

Only the elderly and those with severe existing conditions are at risk and can benefit from a vaccine.",nmldvg,2021-05-31 20:42:05
There are numerous studies that show vaccination is stronger immunity than natural infection.  SIREN study out of the UK.  UC Irvine health care worker study.  The Oxford study on heterotypic immunity and vaccination vs natural infection.,nmldvg,2021-06-01 03:04:51
The RBM of the RBD of the spike protein is the neutralization site of the virus that prevents binding to ACE2.  Why would you need to target any other portion of the virus?  It certainly is bizarre that people like you don't seem to understand how protective immunity works yet are trying to act like you do.  You really should take some basic courses in immunology and virology before trying to have a conversation that you're unqualified to have.,nmldvg,2021-05-31 21:04:41
"From the Israeli study:

>Worldwide shortage of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection while the pandemic is still uncontrolled leads many states to the dilemma whether or not to vaccinate previously infected persons. Understanding the level of protection of previous infection compared to that of vaccination is critical for policy making. We analyze an updated individual-level database of the entire population of Israel to assess the protection efficacy of both prior infection and vaccination in preventing subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization with COVID-19, severe disease, and death due to COVID-19. Vaccination was highly effective with overall estimated efficacy for documented infection of 92·8% (CI:\[92·6, 93·0\]); hospitalization 94·2% (CI:\[93·6, 94·7\]); severe illness 94·4% (CI:\[93·6, 95·0\]); and death 93·7% (CI:\[92·5, 94·7\]). Similarly, the overall estimated level of protection from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for documented infection is 94·8% (CI:\[94·4, 95·1\]); hospitalization 94·1% (CI:\[91·9, 95·7\]); and severe illness 96·4% (CI:\[92·5, 98·3\]). Our results question the need to vaccinate previously-infected individuals.

This contradicts your notion and the Oxford studies notion that the vaccine provides stronger immunity than natural immunity.",nmldvg,2021-06-01 06:12:48
"The SIREN study and UC Irvine studies are controlled study with continuous monitoring for reinfection.  Yours isn't.  Yours is an observational study with numerous confounding factors.  Other observational studies like the Denmark study are in line with the SIREN study.

Another UC Irvine study looked at the antibody repertoire of naturally infected vs immunized individuals and found weak antibodies of naturally infected individuals directed toward the RBD compared to vaccinated individuals.  Weak neutralizing antibodies demonstrates inferior protective immunity.",nmldvg,2021-06-01 06:31:14

Bactrim is weakly anti-inflammatory and the evidence is mainly from mouse studies.

Enterococcus is one of the most common bacteria found in prostatitis.  It's not supposed to be there...

>I felt this horrible intense pain immediately following my vaccines. 

Stress and anxiety are both triggers of epididymitis and prostatitis.  They make it worse.  The symptoms don't fit with the timing of the injection of the vaccine.  It would take more than 30 seconds for a reaction of this type...if it were 2-3 days later, ok, there might be something going on.  But not 30 seconds.

"I came here to interact with knowledgable folks such as yourself, so thanks.

I realize prostate issues are inevitable with age.  Acute onset of prostate inflammation symptoms secondary to the vaccine concerns me, and could indicate possible bacterial infection.  I do believe that I am slowly getting relief in that department from the antibiotics, but the testicle pain persists, and is debilitating.  I have been on gabapentin for almost 8 weeks and have seen little improvement, so I may try amitriptyline next.  Perhaps pregablin is worth a shot though.  I have been doing weekly PFPT with no results.  Acupuncture certainly helps, albeit temporarily.  Also I did a methyl prednisolone taper 2 weeks ago and that helped significantly with the pain. I’m trying to find out if it’s ok to do more steroids but can’t reach my doctor.  

There nerve block is a 20ml .25% buvivacaine hydrochloride injection into the spermatic cord with a 27 ga needle at the pubic tubercle.  Some practitioners advocate a sham injection of normal saline first to rule out malingering.  The purpose of the block is to either provide durable relief with a subsequent course of injections, or to deduce the cause of the pain as neural if pain relief is temporary.  If pain returns, microsurgical denervation may be indicated.  Of course nothing is guaranteed with surgery.  Ultrasound and urinalysis has not revealed any abnormalities, so the pain seems to be idiopathic.  

This is something that people don't like to hear, but **to be clear, in my case, I attribute the etiology of the pain and aforementioned subsequent patient history of genitourinary disease to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.**  It is certainly true that the vaccine could have caused systemic inflammation that led to autoimmune disorder, or I had some latent infection that was asymptomatic...but what's the difference?  I avoided this troubling conclusion for some time but I must listen to my body and use logic to analyze the sequence of events.  All of my symptoms were preceded by the shots.

">I do believe that I am slowly getting relief in that department from the antibiotics, but the testicle pain persists, and is debilitating.

Kind of unorthodox, but maybe also try a strong corticosteroid cream (betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% cream) applied to the scrotum and just underneath.  The skin is thin there and it may help with the pain.  

>25% buvivacaine hydrochloride injection 

Bupivacaine would last around 5 hours.  Botox would last around  6 months.  Denervation seems extreme at this point in time.

>to be clear, in my case, I attribute the etiology of the pain and aforementioned subsequent patient history of genitourinary disease to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  It is certainly true that the vaccine could have caused systemic inflammation that led to autoimmune disorder

Autoimmune disorders take more than 30 seconds to develop; at least 2 weeks and then another couple of weeks for symptoms to become apparent so that can be ruled out.  The only real thing that could possibly occur immediately after injection would be an anaphylactic reaction.  You didn't have one of those as you didn't have any other symptoms.  I know you don't want to hear it but a much more likely scenario is that anxiety of getting the shot to begin with exacerbated an existing infection.",nk1cbr,2021-05-27 15:32:22

I’ve seen news media mentioning that a few people have reported cardiovascular problems post vaccination and that they are being looked into, as appropriate. Do know, experiencing new problems post vaccine does not indicate a correlation between the vaccine and the problem. That’s not to say it isn’t possible, but studies need to be done. If we all decided to jump to conclusions, I could say peanut butter killed my grandma because she ate it 2 days before she died, ignoring the fact that we later found out she was having TIAs. If you want to have an actual discussion and have your concerns addressed by your peers, it’s best to have scholarly articles to back up your opinion. I am always open to discussed and my mind can be changed with actual evidence but if that’s not why you posted this “question” then you’re just trying to scare people and that is pretty shitty in my opinion.",njw2ci,2021-05-24 17:42:14

Yearly average of deaths in US is about 3M (due to whatever the fuck: disease, suicides, fatal accidents, etc.). Now that’s about 0.9% deaths per year per population of ~331M. How many deaths after covid-19 vaccine according to VAERS and CDC? Slightly over 1000 persons. That’s about 0.5% the population of the 164M individuals that have received at least 1 dose. My argument is that those 1000 deaths are completely coincidental and within probability of the average death of our population per year.

"
1: Multiple studies have concluded that people who have survived COVID have immunity as effective as the a vaccine. Some research has pointed towards it being more effective in reality due to immune cell distribution basically if you get it, you have immune cells in your upper respiratory tract, if you get the vaccine, you don’t. (Ref 3 & 4)

2: the vaccine introduces spike proteins into your system, this is effectively the same as giving yourself COVID. No actually, it is. COVID hasn’t been shown to proliferate in most cases, so all the symptoms are either inflammatory, immune response, or finally, agitation from the spike proteins themselves. 

The S1 region of the spike protein has been shown to activate clotting in healthy PPP and WB. It causes anomalous fibrin networks to form without the presence of thrombin. It also shown to cause hyper activity in platelets. And finally it creates clots resistant to trypsinization. And before you ask, yes is the same protein in the vaccines. (Ref 1)

The spike protein has also shown to damage the vascular vessels in general, but more in relation to the cardio pulmonary vasculature. (Ref 2) 


3: Conclusion: Based on the findings now and likely more so in the future, the spike protein itself seems to be the larger culprit in the acute non-immune response related symptoms. So yeah, the vaccine is dangerous and being misrepresented as completely safe. Along with that, research papers and studies that show otherwise are not being promoted. 



So after you take all that in, heres some food for thought. 

The difference between a vaccine that puts the spike protein in your body and a virus that does is this: The virus replicates... very rapidly. That means more damaging proteins are introduced to your system in the time it takes to fight off the disease. The vaccine does introduce these proteins into your system as well, but on a much lower and more controlled scale. Really you’re actually just giving yourself a mild short term case of COVID, twice. 

I’ve had COVID and got very lucky, but I personally know one person who are still on oxygen 4 weeks out after being intubated and then “recovering”.  Another who nearly died, one who did die, and finally one who was in the icu but has since fully recovered. On the other side of the coin, I know about 30-40 people who have had COVID without issue. 

One could make the argument from those numbers that COVID isn’t that serious and the vaccine isn’t necessary. From the same numbers someone could say that a 1 in 10 chance of life threatening illness is enough to get the vaccine. 

Life is about choices, sadly right now you only have two. In all likely hood, you WILL either get COVID or get the vaccine. I had been working from home all year, only left my house to public settings about once a week, and I got it from a damn grocery store I went to for the first time in months. You will get it if you don’t get the vaccine, and if you get the vaccine, you’re basically getting the same thing. pick your poison.



As a final note, if you have had COVID, according to the WHO itself, you’re good to go, obviously that all depends on if you develop a robust immune response. Which was shown to be of acceptable levels even in non-symptomatic cases. But you should be good, and don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise cause they’re full of shit and probably don’t even understand what they’re regurgitating.

"This is a terrible understanding of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, the vaccines, and immunology, in general.  

1.  You are far more likely to have ectopic follicular B cell activation with SARS-CoV-2 than vaccination (haven't heard of it at all with vaccination).  Having immune cells in the lungs is not a good thing.  The only cells that should be needed are alveolar macrophages which are already there.  Immune cells are formed in lymphoid tissue.  The entire ""localized"" argument is just anti-vaxx nonsense as IgA is produced in vaccination.  

2.  Having the spike protein present is not the same thing as giving yourself COVID.  In the vaccine, the spike protein is surface expressed by cells.  It's not free in a viral particle to travel throughout the body.  It's going to be in the muscle cells where it's injected.  It's not going to cause direct damage to the cardiopulmonary system as it doesn't travel to or through the cardiopulmonary system.  

3.  Based on the above, your conclusion about the vaccine is misinformed and wrongheaded.  Maybe if we had a ""traditional"" vaccine of just the spike protein, you might have an argument.

"Your informed consent was horrible. You were lied to. The evidence is in  why the thousands are dying all over the world from all four experiments. First the endothelial tissue is attacked by the spike proteins by the down regulation of ace 2 receptors. This is what's causing the clots, strokes, heart attacks and bleeding. This information came out in April in Cardio Pulmonary journals. and is backed by a concluded scientific study. Then you have the SM-102 which although google fact checkers says is safe the actual osha data sheet reveals its not to be given to animals or humans. Its basically the envelope the mrna rests in. Its fatty lipid molecules with a outer portion being chloroform. Once the chloroform reaches the blood stream it interacts with arterial oxygen then converting to phosgene. This was used in ww1 as a weapon. Phosgene is a neuro toxin. Once this phosgene is beyond the blood brain barrier it attacks the frontal lobe causing degenerative cns diseases that are incurable. There is no known antidote for phosgene. These were once rare prion disorders but they are showing up as side effects in these experiments.  I have had my first amendment rights violated on platforms trying to warn others. I'm not antivax I'm just honest about what I see here. About 5000 people have died in the Usa so far from these experiments and the media still waves the flag of safety over them and now the push is to get the children involved in the experiments.

I’m too poor to get it but my friend just did it. She had ZERO side effects—and also got to enjoy Las Vegas with the celebrity treatment! 🤩 
And the best part is the zero side effects guarantee. Basically the guarantee states that if you have any side effects requiring hospitalization, you will get a free six nights day at either of these luxurious resorts. That’s right, FREE! As in not paying any money!

They are Indian and a doctor.  That is two major strikes against them.  India is flooded with COVID right now which means extreme viral loads.  The dominant variant there is one that is more deadly and is able to evade the vaccine somewhat better than the original strain.  Doctors are exposed to the virus on an hourly basis for days at a time.  The vaccine can only help so much.,nihgst,2021-05-23 06:27:38

"I don't either, but I don't find the premise impossible, and if it IS true, it doesn't mean the vaccines aren't miraculously effective.  No one is claiming vaccines prevent 100% of serious illness from Covid.  Just nearly that to such a degree that they vastly decrease the risk of death.  But statistically speaking, millions of vaccinated people still being exposed to covid (and especially people under a high viral load, like a doctor treating patients in the midst of a huge outbreak) means that a small number will get seriously ill, and death is not impossible.",nihgst,2021-05-22 18:43:45
"This is not correct.  With the mNRA vaccines, there are theoretically millions of variations that could impact the virus as a whole without altering the protein spike the vaccine mimics to provoke immunity in a vaccinated individual.  And even minor variations in that actual spike might not be sufficient to allow the virus to evade detection by an immune system educated to recognize the generic spike.  Several common variations have already proven susceptible to the vaccine induced immunity, and to date, none have been found that aren't.  Part of the genius of this particular mode of vaccinating is it's robustness in the face of a rapidly mutating virus.  The rest of what makes it particularly effective is that a mutation that effects this specific protein spike (the one that lets it enter and infect your cells) is just as likely to make it unable to interact with and infect your cells, as it is to help it evade your immune system.

These vaccines are really a triumph of intellect, ingenuity and knowledge over one of our oldest foes (viruses) and it would be great if people learned more about how they work and why they are so amazing.",nihgst,2021-05-22 18:41:08

1. There is no universal rule that spike protein mutation will render it ineffective to gain entry into the host cells. How did you state that? 
2. How much antibody level should an individual have for vaccination to be successful? CDC has not said that. Till then just merely getting vaccinated is a hit or miss scenario. To be specific, I am an Indian and lot many doctors, fully vaccinated, have expired. We need the level to be determined 
Thanks in advance",nihgst,2021-05-23 11:11:18
My theory is a lot of vaccinated people that test positive aren't really infected with the virus.  The test is literally to stick a swab in your nose and then analyze to see if the virus is present.  If I cough on a table and you see the virus it doesn't mean the table is infected.  It just means the  virus is on the surface.  The vaccine prevents the virus from taking hold of the body forcing it to live on the outside.  Basically the nose is the only place it can live in those situations.  A blood test would likely yield no infection.,nihgst,2021-05-23 06:30:42

"> This will also help scientists know the different types of side effects in different genders, age groups etc..

I cannot stress enough how important that is. One of the core argument behind vaccine hesitancy is that mRNA and adenovirus based vaccines are still experimental, and that there isn't enough data to assert their safety in the medium and long term, especially in the case of demographics on which the vaccines haven't been properly tested such a children, adolescents, pregnant women etc.

This is a catch 22. There won't be enough data until there are enough volunteers from all demographics that take the vaccines and report on the side effects. It is paramount that everyone who volunteers also reports on the side effects or lack thereof.",nhj4im,2021-05-21 08:14:45

An important takeaway however was that if you have been previously infected with Covid and show “robust immunity” with an antibody or T-cell test, your risk for adverse side-effects is greater should you choose to become vaccinated.

"Define what ""normal"" means.

The Covid-19 spike protein, which is the virus ""signature"" that the mRNA / adenovirus DNA vectors of the vaccines instruct your cells to produce to trigger the immune reaction, have a prion-like domain (proteic structure functionally similar to a prion) that causes neurodegeneration so it is not completely unexpected that you would experience neurologic symptoms when administered with a vaccine that instructs your cells to produce large amounts these spike proteins.

This is something that can just happen when your body undergoes stress-,nggtyp,2021-05-20 01:10:58
With the vaccine certainly does. When I got covid I didn’t get my period for 3 months,nggtyp,2021-05-20 01:11:14
They don’t have actual studies or research done on this unfortunately- it’s purely anecdotal. But your body thinks it’s sick since it was injected and now reacting to the spike protein. It’s not necessarily abnormal to miss a period in reaction to something like this- but unfortunately we just don’t “know for sure” yet the reasons why women are missing their periods from covid and/or the vaccine,nggtyp,2021-05-20 01:12:34

I have also felt what you are describing, but it is is not a side affect of the vaccine. This year has been traumatic for all of us.

The fact that I could finally get a vaccine, that my safety was no longer in the hands of others, that we might be able to go back to ""normal"" (aka a ""before"", as is talked about a lot when considering PTSD and trauma)... It's just as overwhelming as the ongoing crisis we have gotten used to.

My advice is to write about it, or vlog about it. What does getting the vaccine mean for you? What has happened to you in the last year? Have you lost anyone? Have you not been able to do some things you had planned? I would go into depth, and you might find some emotions popping up that you took for granted or pushed to the side.

"There's a link between anxiety and costochondritis.  Dizziness, heart racing, and chest tightness are all signs of anxiety as well.  Costochondritis is kind of a weird thing because one small tweak can give you it and it makes you basically feel like you're having a heart attack until it resolves.   When you have anxiety, you tend to breathe with your shoulders rather than your diaphragm.  This causes shallow breathing which in turn causes rapid breathing which leads to hyperventilation, rapid heart rate, chest tightness, and dizziness.  That shoulder breathing can tweak the costosternal joint slightly, resulting in costochondritis.  For me, all it took was a hug from somebody to get costochondritis.

The good thing is that it can resolve on its own or can be resolved with a course of prednisone or a simple corticosteroid injection.  The bad thing is that you don't want to get on a corticosteroid right now while your body is making antibodies or it'll ablate the immune response.  Overall, though, it's most likely not related to the vaccine and you should get the second dose but try to stay calm, focus on breathing with your diaphragm (lay on your back and watch your stomach raise when you breathe), and you can take some ibuprofen to try to settle it.",nfui9o,2021-05-19 05:05:08

Costochondritis can be worsened by stress and hormones, so if you’re a woman like me it may worsen if you’re nearing your period. Just take extra good care of yourself and avoid high-anxiety situations.",nfui9o,2021-05-23 08:01:26

"Generally, you'll have a stronger reaction to the second dose.  But, I'm just not sure if you actually had a ""strong"" response to this dose.  It really sounds like generalized anxiety that caused your response to this dose and you've essentially ""thrown out"" your costosternal joint like a person would ""throw out"" their back.  Costochondritis is mostly associated with muscle strain/trauma...not immune system inflammatory response.  For respiratory viruses, it's either caused by direct infection of the costochondral junctions (which isn't possible with this vaccine) or simply by a person coughing so much that they inflame the joints (which is muscle strain).",nfui9o,2021-05-23 04:45:51

">(i) Over-vaccination of the population could lead to new Covid strains evolving to find ways around the effectiveness of current vaccines.

The same thing could be said about natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Except more so because titers of the virus will be higher in naive infection than vaccinated infection.

>(ii) There are unknown long-term effects. These vaccines are still experimental.

This is a canard.  The effect of vaccination long term would be the same effect of COVID-19 long term, except less so due to lower titer and less severe disease.

>(iii) Short term adverse reactions to the vaccine are putting additional strain on health services, e.g. many people in the UK are attending hospital with severe headaches or other concerning symptoms following vaccination. Side effects leading to death or serious illness are rare, but the need to be cautious in response to adverse reactions is putting pressure on doctors and hospitals.

The strain on health care systems is nowhere near what it would be for natural infection.  We've seen hospital systems collapse due to COVID-19.  We have yet to see a hospital system anywhere collapse due to having side effects of vaccination.  A very weak, if not absurd, argument.

>(iv) T-cell long term immunity, as with SARS from 2002, is likely contributing to herd immunity in addition to the vaccination program, mitigating the need for the non-vulnerable to be vaccinated.

T cell immunity is not protective immunity.  You need antibodies for protective immunity.  Without them, you risk escape.

>(v) Given that the vulnerable are currently suffering from Covid in e.g. India, and doctors in developing countries are dying, should we not be redirecting all vaccines through the COVAX program before vaccinating the non-vulnerable in richer nations, e.g. the UK and US, where the vulnerable populations have already largely been vaccinated?

Doctors in developed countries have died.  Case loads up until a month or two ago were higher in developed countries than in developing countries.  India tried the approach you are advocating here.  Is this not the outcome you expected because it was a fairly obvious outcome to anybody that's been paying attention.

>(vi) There is not yet sufficient evidence that the vaccines reduce transmission, or understanding of the mechanism by which they would do so. 

There's sufficient evidence of reduced transmission at this point in time.  Case loads dropping.  Minimal breakthrough events in vaccinated populations.  And the mechanism would be the same mechanism for other viruses...antibody binding to the receptor binding protein (S) that prevents entry into cells and subsequent replication.  

>They don't produce the same kind of immune response in the lungs that natural immunity produces to reduce transmission.

The immune response in the lungs is what contributes to severe disease.  It's not a benefit to long term immunity.  It's a hinderance.  The vaccines induce a B cell response with IgG and IgA class switched antibodies, Th1 T cell response, and a CD8 T cell response.  What else do you need?

>If however, as some studies show, they reduce transmission via another mechanism (e.g. less viral load being detected in the nostrils), then that would indicate that Covid cannot be transmitted by asymptomatic cases which also have very low viral load (the majority of the cases diagnosed in young people).

This does not follow.  First off, viral titers are higher in young individuals.  And asymptomatic individuals have similar viral titers as symptomatic individuals when controlling for time.   And the majority of cases in young people are not asymptomatic.  The rest of your comment is moot.

>Future strains of Covid will naturally become as harmless as a cold within the near term, but could this be compromised by over-vaccination of the population?

There is near zero selective pressure for SARS-CoV-2 to become harmless in the near term.  It is very effective at spreading and does not kill individuals before sufficient spread.  Where's the pressure to mutate to become less harmless when efficient human to human transmission already occurs?

Flu shots exist.... Curious,nffgn7,2021-05-18 21:27:02
In the transmission part are you saying that the vaccines lower the viral load to the levels of asymptomatic people?,nffgn7,2021-05-18 22:13:36
"(i) Doesn't not vaccinating people and allowing the virus to be alive in as many people as possible also give it great opportunity to evolve and possibly become a more dangerous and contagious strain? I mean we've already seen that happening in Africa and India. We data proof that high vaccination rates lead to positive results of lower covid cases. Look at Israel.

It makes far more sense to get as many people vaccinated as possible so then the virus will have less chances to spread. Less chances to spread means less chances of it evolving. I'm afraid that all the unvaccinated people out there are going to allow this virus to evolve to be strong enough for the vaccine not to work as well. We need to stop the virus asap.

(ii) We KNOW Covid can have long term side effects. Even on healthy young children. There is no theoretical reason to suspect the vaccine will have a long term side effect. It disappears from your body quickly. [Here is a good video of an expert discussing why long term side effects will not be a worry](https://youtu.be/AGkQ8NKcDKw)

Also when you use the word ""experimental"" it's kind of vague. Yes the vaccine is new to us using them. But we've been studying SARS and mRNA for years. The ground work for the vaccines were already done before covid even hit. And over 200 million people are vaccinated. That's a giant sample of data to use to know the safety levels of the vaccine, which is really positive. Specially for a virus that has killed so many.

(iii) Most of the side effects from the vaccine are minor enough for people to treat them at home with Tylenol. I myself just had a bit of a headache, took a Tylenol and was perfectly fine. People getting covid is a much bigger strain on the hospitals than side effects from the vaccine. I had a friend who is a very healthy 33 year old and got hospitalized from covid. People getting the vaccine is what is making hospitals not be overwhelmed anymore. 

(iv) You do get some immunity from covid after having covid, so if you recently had covid, sure you can wait and put it off a bit. But don't put it off forever cause immunity doesn't last forever. And if you haven't had it, it's not worth getting covid just so you can later be immune to it when you don't have to get it at all. Getting covid is a gamble. Some people are completely fine and don't even know they have it. Some feel like it's just the flu. But some people get long term problems. Organ damage that never heals or die. And just because you're young and seemingly healthy doesn't mean you can't be one of those with serious long term effects. You don't have that risk if you just get the vaccine. It's an unnecessary gamble. Also we don't know other possible long term effects covid might have. For example when you get the chicken pox you are years later at risk of Shingles. But if you've been vaccinated from chicken pox you don't face the risk of developing shingles later in life. There could be an issue like this that develops with covid. 

(v) I do agree that we need to be focusing on helping more vulnerable areas. This is a world issue. Helping other countries be safe from the pandemic in term helps our own country. I'm in the US where the vaccine is plentiful, we are definitely at the point where we need to spread the wealth. And I believe that's what we're doing. I just read recently that Biden is sending 20 million vaccines overseas to foreign allies. 

(vi) I don't think this is really a good reason to not get vaccinated. We know the vaccine is safe. Everyone who can get vaccinated should get vaccinated. It's a gamble to not be vaccinated and not knowing how you personally will be effected by the virus. 

And yes, we're still learning about how transmission works in vaccinated people since we are in the early stages of vaccination and seeing the data. But from what we know the chances of spreading covid after being vaccinated is extremely low. This is a bonus reason to get vaccinated. To help stop the spread. From what I had gathered this is a similar case for people who are asymptomatic with covid. They can spread it, but the chances are a bit lower than someone who has symptoms (Probably not as low as someone whose been vaccinated though, that is the way the data seems to be leaning. But still collecting data). And even if asymptomatic people didn't spread covid (even though they totally can) that's still not a very good reason to not get vaccinated.

Here's an interesting article regarding T-cells: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00367-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00367-7). 

I wasn't referring to T-cell immunity as protective immunity. The presence of killer T-cells in the lungs from prior infection prevent transmission from where there is large viral shedding, thus contributing to herd immunity if the host cannot transmit the virus if/when subsequently re-infected. 

Not a single hospital in the UK has collapsed due to Covid. I'm referring to the UK when I'm talking about the additional pressures being placed upon the NHS due to vaccine side effects. 

These vaccines are still experimental. The FDA in the US can't approve them until longer term assessment has been done. There are reasons for such due diligence. Long term side effects from vaccines do exist. There are an increasing number of cases emerging to suggest that adverse reactions are more severe in people who are vaccinated following prior infection with covid, and the reactions they have experienced have been worse than those they experienced during infection with Covid.

With reference to your comment about doctors in developed countries dying too - in the UK at least all doctors have now been vaccinated, as have all other health workers. All vulnerable people are close to having received both injections. Are you saying that India has already vaccinated all its doctors when you mentioned that India has already tried this approach? In which case that would mean that the vaccines don't work against the Indian strain. It wasn't clear what you meant so I may have picked this up wrong. Surely it would be kindest for the UK/US and other countries to provide our remaining vaccines to healthcare workers and the vulnerable in those countries facing the greatest current crises before giving them to the non-vulnerable in countries where currently 0 or close to zero daily deaths are being recorded (the UK for example). India, Nepal, Bangladesh etc are facing the most serious turmoil due to Covid at the moment and it seems unimaginably cruel and selfish of other countries who are not in crisis to squander their vaccines on the non-vulnerable ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-57154233](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-57154233)).

As you mention, SARS-CoV-2 is very effective at spreading. As such many more people have been infected than can be accounted for by the PCR tests. The death rate is now estimated at 0.15% which is on par with a serious flu season. Many people have also developed some degree of natural immunity, and this will aid in making future iterations of the disease less impactful and more akin to an average flu season.",nffgn7,2021-05-19 00:49:28

"There is some research that indicates that the vaccines lower the viral load, and therefore the transmission, but not enough research yet to confirm that the vaccines do prevent transmission. I'm not sure about the difference in viral load between vaccinated people who have been exposed to coronavirus and of asymptomatic people. Asymptomatic people have very low, almost undetectable viral loads. The PCR tests work by effectively magnifying the viral load by many orders to detect if any virus exists in a person's nostrils. It remains uncertain at which level of viral load a person can transmit the virus to others, e.g. via transmission when talking. However, if vaccines work to reduce transmission via reducing (but not eliminating) viral load, then it seems to me that it would follow that asymptomatic transmission was never possible in the first place. There is no conclusive proof that asymptomatic transmission is possible. In fact, a study of 10 million people tested in Wuhan found no evidence of asymptomatic transmission (the findings were published in a BMJ article).",nffgn7,2021-05-18 22:28:59
"Thanks for your kindly written and good comprehensive response.

I agree, high vaccination rates have given great reprieve from cases of severe illness, as is the case in Israel and the UK. Natural immunity has also played some role in cases being reduced. Given that the virus is now endemic it will continue to find pathways to infecting people and new strains will develop. I believe that caution needs to be taken with over-vaccinating a population (i.e. vaccinating children and the non-vulnerable) as that can lead to the new strains finding pathways that evade the immunity that the vaccines provide, such that continued transmission and hence survival of the virus is possible. We need the vaccines to continue to be a useful means of preventing severe disease in the most vulnerable around the world. I agree with vaccinating the vulnerable, and health care workers, and I would agree with full population vaccination if SARS-CoV-2 was a static disease, like polio or measles or chickenpox. In the case of these other diseases the same vaccine that was used 20 years ago can be used today. That is not the case for an evolving virus that is more similar in form to a cold virus (although significantly more severe in its current iteration).

Covid can have long-term effects, but so too can the vaccines, and these effects need to be more fully assessed before the vaccines can be moved from their current status of being experimental (FDA classification) to fully approved. In the UK it has been recommended that under 40s have an alternative to the AZ vaccine due to the risk of blood clots being greater than the risk associated with illness from Covid. With respect to those who are classed as non-vulnerable to illness from Covid there is a cost-benefit analysis that needs to be done to determine whether or not taking the vaccine will put increased net pressure on health services.

I agree that Covid is a much bigger strain on health services than the vaccine side effects, but non-vulnerable people are less at risk from Covid than they are from a typical cold. There are exceptions, as with your friend. Statistically speaking though the benefits of young healthy people taking the vaccine as a means of protecting themselves from Covid is going over the score. The vaccine provides a massive reduction is severe cases of Covid in the vulnerable and it is also not necessary for the population to be fully vaccinated for herd-immunity to be achieved. The percentage of people required to have antibodies to achieve herd-immunity varies by region, but I've seen estimates of 60% for the UK. This value has already been achieved between vaccination and natural developed immunity among the population, therefore negating the need for vaccinations to be extended to the non-vulnerable.

The biggest study of its kind to date has found no evidence of asymptomatic transmission ([https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695)).

Working outside and labor jobs doesn't build your immune system.  You could be outside in the middle of Antarctica and you won't get sick, but you won't do anything for your immune system.  Vaccines build your immune system.",nffgn7,2021-05-19 05:23:13
"> The biggest study of its kind to date has found no evidence of asymptomatic transmission (https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695).

The intent of the[study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w) was not to gauge asymptomatic transmission.  To try to draw that conclusion from the study is asinine.  To quote the article that you posted:  ""The researchers said that their findings did not show that the virus couldn’t be passed on by asymptomatic carriers, and they didn’t suggest that their findings were generalisable.""  

>I wasn't referring to T-cell immunity as protective immunity. The presence of killer T-cells in the lungs from prior infection prevent transmission from where there is large viral shedding, thus contributing to herd immunity if the host cannot transmit the virus if/when subsequently re-infected.

T cells only act on infected cells.  You cannot ""prevent"" shedding fast enough without antibodies.  Furthermore, as I've pointed out numerous times, the CD8 T cells population is limited to a stem-like phenotype rather than effector phenotype due to an HLA restriction. https://www.pnas.org/content/117/39/24384  Less than 50% of naturally infected have memory CD8 T cells against SARS-CoV-2 at 8 months post infection.

>Not a single hospital in the UK has collapsed due to Covid. I'm referring to the UK when I'm talking about the additional pressures being placed upon the NHS due to vaccine side effects.

The world is bigger than the UK.  But, I highly doubt any hospital in the UK has collapsed from people complaining about vaccine side effects either.

>These vaccines are still experimental. The FDA in the US can't approve them until longer term assessment has been done.

The FDA requires 6 months of data for approval.  Pfizer has already started the process for full FDA approval.  

>There are reasons for such due diligence. Long term side effects from vaccines do exist.

Few and far between.  And all of them come within 45 days of vaccination.

>There are an increasing number of cases emerging to suggest that adverse reactions are more severe in people who are vaccinated following prior infection with covid...the reactions they have experienced have been worse than those they experienced during infection with Covid.

They are equivalent to adverse events that people get with their second vaccine dose.  This isn't anything new here.  We certainly haven't seen that the reactions are ""worse"" in our studies.

>Are you saying that India has already vaccinated all its doctors when you mentioned that India has already tried this approach?

Never said that.  I'm saying for perspective, people will die taking the ""let nature run its course"" approach that you are advocating in a piss poor attempt to try to get people not to take the vaccine.

>Surely it would be kindest for the UK/US and other countries to provide our remaining vaccines to healthcare workers and the vulnerable in those countries facing the greatest current crises before giving them to the non-vulnerable in countries where currently 0 or close to zero daily deaths are being recorded (the UK for example). 

The US has already sent vaccines to India.  We don't have a massive surplus of vaccines in the US.  India has the world's largest vaccine manufacturer (SII).  The roll out has been slowed down due to a fire but the over 60 population has already been offered the vaccine in India.

India's currently waiting population are those that you would consider ""non-vulnerable.""  

>The death rate is now estimated at 0.15% which is on par with a serious flu season. 

Who told you that garbage?  In first world nations like the US, it's around 0.6-0.8% no matter how you cut it.  It doesn't get down into the 0.15% unless you're in some place like sub-Saharan Africa where the median age is around 20.  A bad flu season in the US kills around 80,000.  We've had more than 600,000 deaths in the US since the beginning of the pandemic.  To try to equate the two is ridiculous.

"We are gonna have to disagree on this. I don't think you can over vaccinate with covid. I think we are more likely to get mutations and new strains from allowing this virus to further circulate between unvaccinated people. Your idea of over vaccinating causing this to happen makes no sense. The more people it infects the greater chance of evolution and the greater chance it will evolve into a stronger strain. Having limited transmission won't automatically increase chances of a deadly evolution. 

And the natural immunity is not long term. What happens when their immunity wears off and they are vulnerable to covid again? Not vaccinating as much people as possible asap allows the virus to survive long enough to be around when that happens and maybe be worse and actually do more damage to those survivors the second time around.

I imagine it would be difficult to get enough information to determine this in a normal flu year where there is not such widespread PCR testing. In some years the flu vaccine efficacy has been so low as to deem it useless, e.g. in 2015 when the prevailing strains were not well predicted - https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11393560/Flu-jab-given-to-millions-is-useless.html",nffgn7,2021-05-18 22:18:17

I always love when someone brings up this witty analogy. A nice reminder of how society in Galileo and Copernicus' time was so indoctrinated by mainstream propaganda and so scared of the consequences of going against the dominant dogma that they couldn't - no in fact didn't want to - see the evidence that was laid in front their eyes.

In hindsight, it is easy for us to see how the main dogma was bogus time and again with their ridiculous idea that earth was flat, or that it was center of the universe, and how all the people that supported the dogma were either fools or cowards. And it is easy to imagine that we would be on the right side of history should that kind of situation happen again. But in truth, looking at the facts objectively when the whole society yells at you that you shouldn't, and making a stand for what is right and just takes courage and integrity.

You can feel free to look for a job that doesn't require the vaccine.  I'm sure there will be some companies out there that don't mandate it.

>why should we put something in our bodies that hasn’t been around long enough to be safe ?

It has been around long enough to determine safety.  Reactions to vaccines happen within the first 45 days.  

>I hope this ends up being safe for the ones that have received it 10 years from now. 

Reactions to vaccines happen within 45 days.  The ""10 year from now"" argument is rather bunk.  Think about it.  How many vaccines do you take as a child that are already RNA vaccines?  The oral polio vaccine, measles vaccine, mumps vaccine, and the nasal influenza vaccine are all ""RNA"" vaccines.  They all deliver RNA to the cells...just instead of using a synthetic lipid particle to do it like Moderna and Pfizer, they use a lipid in the form of a virus package to do it.  The RNA still gets into the cells and is translated into proteins that the body then generates antibodies against.  

>The initial side effects that people are having are different for everyone. 

The side effects people are having are very standard for nearly any vaccine.  

>It should be a choice to trust this and personally I don’t .

It should also be the choice of the employer as to who they hire.

What do you imagine would be the long term?  The vaccine is cleared by the body in a very short amount of time.  Weeks.  The rest is the immune response.  If there were an aberrant immune response to the vaccine, we'd know about it already as it would be seen in millions of vaccine recipients.",nef2qw,2021-05-18 18:27:32
">But why do you say all viruses deliver RNA? 

Those are all live attenuated viruses.  They infect the cells and replicate within the cells.  In order to do that, they have to deliver the payload (their RNA) into the cells.  

>They don't identify parts of viruses in order to trigger responses... as far as I understand it. 

What does this sentence mean?  The body produces antibodies against the receptor binding protein.  That's the neutralization site of the virus.  The rest of the virus is rather unimportant in terms of protective immunity.  

>My concern is mainly those synthetic lipids though.  They seem to cause a lot of problems with inflammation—inflammation can lead to cancer down the road.

This is such a non-concern.  The lipid/mRNA complexes are stable for a short amount of time once inside the body.  They are degraded rapidly.  They don't hang around in the body and don't create chronic inflammation.  You'll experience more inflammation through just living than you would through the small amount of LNPs given in this vaccine.  

In fact, there are FDA approved cancer drugs that use lipids for more effective delivery.  Doxil, for instance, has been an FDA approved drug since 1995 and uses a LNP to more effectively deliver doxorubicin to cells.  There are about 5-6 other lipid-carrier cancer therapeutics that are FDA approved.  On the vaccine side of things, Epaxal (for HepA) and Inflexal V (for influenza) both use lipids and are FDA approved.",nef2qw,2021-05-18 19:44:41

My entire family except my husband have had the vaccine. I’m fortunate that they are not in my business . They understand and they pretty much all had the same feelings. They are all older and are high risk and if I was older I probably would have done the same. Not to say that if I got Covid that I would be fine.

"You're going off of old, old CDC info, before they had the comprehensive data they have now to show the efficacy overall is over 90% (unlikely to catch it), and if you're unlikely to catch it, you're REALLY unlikely to spread it - since you can't really spread something you're not infected with. 

What you said in your post is what the CDC was saying months ago. Like in January. 

So, using the current info from the CDC and the plethora of data and studies they have cited on their information page, the new guidelines would make sense.",ndbw2e,2021-05-16 03:03:33

"The vaccine is 95% effective (a VERY high rate compared to most vaccines) but that extra 5% means you can still catch it or transmit it. One of the greatest benefits of the vaccine has been that it SIGNIFICANTLY reduces severe disease even if you do catch it, so you’re not going to end up on a ventilator if you’re part of the unlucky 5%. 

As for the mask changes, I think part of it is that so many are vaccinated now, so the likelyhood is lowered by that too. I also think it’s meant to motivate some who are on the fence, like “hate the masks? Boy do we have a solution for you!”. I think it would be wrong to draw assumptions that Covid isn’t as bad as some said just because we’re starting to come out of it slowly. Way too many people died for us to ever consider it “not that bad”, and I have several very young (20-30s) healthy friends who still have really awful lingering health issues after Covid. 

I can’t say I understand your hesitancy because that isn’t something I struggled with at all when I got my vaccine. But I can say that you’re at least taking the right steps. My big suggestion would be to ask these questions to your doctor. Internet people will be rude and not give you the best info (including me). Talk to your doc, tell him/her that you understand your questions may frustrate him/her, but you would really appreciate some patience and tolerance while you work through this. And if they can answer your questions you can consider it from a more well informed place. 

I hope this helps at least a little. Try not to overthink too much. We should rely on experts in their fields who dedicate their lives to their studies. Just like we rely on mechanics and technicians for their expertise. You’d never want to see me work on a car haha. For me, I’m just trusting the science.

I’ll be honest: I’m not really all that interested in your life.  I got my shot and now I will go mask free wherever I am allowed to.

"I can see why it doesn’t make sense to you- it’s because the point of getting the vaccine (or any vaccine during a pandemic) wasn’t made clear to you, or you’re thinking in absolutes.

Definitely do not think of this situation and our goals in black and white - the point of trying to get everyone vaccinated is to reduce transmissibility and to reduce our own risk of contracting it in whatever we do in our daily lives, AND/OR reduce chances of being hospitalized with severe reactions if you do get it. Viral load is an extremely important factor in transmissibility- the more you produce while you are symptomatically or asymptomatically sick with COVID, the higher are the CHANCES that you spread it to someone else. Getting the vaccine means that even if you contract COVID, your viral load would be much less than if you were to have contracted COVID without having had the vaccine (because the vaccine produces the antibodies needed to fight the virus, and if they’re already there with the “instructions on how to fight it” as soon as you contract it, your symptoms won’t be as bad as they would have been without the antibodies... in a vaccinated person, they’ve “seen” what the enemy looks like so they know how to fight it off). So long story short- getting vaccinated = significantly less chance in getting severely sick = lowers chance of producing high viral loads in the event you do contract the virus = significant reduction in CHANCES of transmissibility of the virus. When enough of this happens, we can starve the virus of healthy hosts to live in and reduce the rate at which it could possibly mutate into a deadlier or more transmissible virus.

We can’t get rid of COVID entirely, but the goal is to reduce our chances of contracting it wherever we go, whatever we do, whoever we interact with... because we still have to live our lives. I personally still choose to wear a mask sometimes even when vaccinated depending on many factors (how many people from different households am I hanging out with? Are they all vaccinated/have enough antibodies now? Is this restaurant too packed? Are we meeting outdoors? Do I have plans to visit older loved ones or friends who haven’t had the chance to be vaccinated/protected yet?) It’s all about risk tolerance in every unique situation.",ndbw2e,2021-05-16 14:49:19

They’re all asymptomatic which is fantastic, because we know what could have happened. However I can’t shake the feeling of “it’s supposed to reduce the spread” yet here we are.

"Covid causes serious illness and long term chronic health problems. It's not just about death. 

The other reason for mass vaccination is because, as you may (or perhaps aren't aware of) covid can easily overwhelm hospitals and the health care system. The hospitalization rate is very high.

Take a look at India. There were people with moderate illness that needed oxygen and died because there wasn't enough. People that didn't even have covid died because they couldn't get medical care. People that needed to be hospitalized couldn't get a bed.

The bottom line is that we have saved hundreds of thousands of lives with vaccination. That's a lot. You never know whether someone in your family could die from this. Why take the chance?

Unvaccinated people also contribute to the spread of new variants and put immunocompromised people and other subsets that can't get the vaccine or who don't form antibodies at risk. It's best that everyone gets vaccinated.",ndbw2e,2021-05-20 06:38:59

"So first of all, what are you trading off? It's either the vaccine or covid. And we already know that up to 30% if not more of people with covid have long term chronic symptoms. Covid is a vascular disease. It can cause long term organ damage, heart problems, blood clots, neurological problems, etc. And we know that to be true. So you have to consider the effect that covid will have on your body long term. 

mRNA vaccines have been studied in clinical trials for many years, so they aren't new. There have not been any long term serious side effects identified. 

Scientists say that the majority of serious side effects will arise within the first six months, based on how vaccines work and their experiences in the past. They say that the vaccines are safe and based off of how they actually work in your body, it is very very unlikely that there will be any long term issues. 

So yes, sure there is always that .001% chance of something bad happening as a result of mRNA vaccines, but there is also a very small chance that you will die of covid and a moderate chance that you will have long term health problems from covid.

I have a history of depression that over the course of many years was eventually treated with the right medication, and I successfully came off meds after some time.

And for what it’s worth, by the time I got my second shot (yesterday) the depression/melancholy had subsided.

I had an adverse reaction to the vaccine and while generally most people that take the vaccine are completely fine and it’s overall safe there are certainly some major issues the vaccine is causing for some people and there is no explanation as to why. If I had even a slight clue that these things could happen I would not have taken the vaccine. I do not have underlying health concerns though and probably would be ok if I got Covid but wanted to get the vaccine to protect my family and the community. I think I will be ok now but it was hell after the vaccine and I was hospitalized. I do not feel ok with my children taking the vaccine anytime soon until this is all uncovered and there are answers and sure as heck would advise you not to (at least yet) if you were my daughter!

"Yes! but my progression was strange...spleen pain within hours. Then eye spasms, twitching, tingling 24 hours later. Then mouth sores three weeks later. The eye spasms, “fireworks” pins and needle feeling, etc have persisted (6 weeks later). Mouth sores still there but going away. I really wasn’t sure if the mouth sores are/were related. But after some research (mostly focused on scientific research on COVID vs vaccine), am thinking there is a chance it could be. Some theories are suggesting that you could have underlying latent infection or dormant virus (e.g., the herpes virus that is common and causes cold sores) that vaccine triggers or complicates. But in general, mouth sores are a symptom of COVID. And also happens to a lot of people when their immune system is fighting something. I normally wouldn’t worry but want to get the second shot and trying to figure out if I/we should consider anti-viral medications before getting it to avoid a flare up? I believe in the vaccine and overall safety and advocate for getting it. I just wish we were doing a better job of systematically studying these things so we can offer more tailored recommendations to avoid and/or address in folks who experience some of these largely rare (and potentially indirect) issues within the first six weeks of vaccination.

"I was infected in early 2020. I had what they deem a ""mild"" case as I did not end up in the hospital. I was sick, though, and gasped for air (scaryAF) during two coughing fits. I also had fever, chills, aches, and fatigue. 9 months later, I took an antibody test--nothing. Now, perhaps my T-cells were on alert despite the antibodies going away, but we'll never know.   


I'm now fully vaccinated--Moderna--and they DO know that it confers AT LEAST 6 months of immunity. Time will tell if it works for a year or more.",ncspba,2021-05-15 16:50:13
The vaccine helps your body develop the antibodies to fight COVID without being infected. The infection is getting sick from the virus.,ncspba,2021-05-16 21:07:37

"
Getting infected or getting a vaccine is the same thing. Both produces antibodies. The only thing missing is that in both the cases, a minimum antibody level is to be attained in the body to be able to fight the virus when it gains entry into the body.
For ex, if your Hepatitis B surface antibody level  is more than 10 IU/ml, you are protected from Hepatitis B. it doesn't depend whether you got this level by previous Hep B infection or by Hep B vaccine.
But such a consensus regarding the level of Covid-19 Spike antibody  to be called as  protective hasn't been reached. So, all efforts are restricted to getting vaccinated first.",ncspba,2021-05-15 14:03:33

"Can I ask who you're referring to when you say ""they"" in your last part? I haven't been able to find any information explicitly stating immunity for at least 6 months. From what I've been reading the immunity whether its from getting infected or through a vaccine last about the same length of time.",ncspba,2021-05-15 17:03:52
Can you still spread it even if you have the vaccine?,ncspba,2021-05-17 03:06:00
I haven't found anything saying either of those. From the NIH I've found that after infection most people are immune up to 6-8 months. I also found from the CDC that they don't know how long immunity from the vaccine lasts.,ncspba,2021-05-15 14:26:39

"Asymptomatic infection will give you almost zero level of antibodies as seen in most of the cases. However, symptomatic Covid gives you good amount of antibodies. So does vaccination. So they advise for vaccination. Since the end point, how much level of antibodies is enough for prevention of Covid-19 is not established, so they are asking for vaccination.",ncspba,2021-05-15 14:48:49
"The big difference here is viral load. You can be infected with a low viral load, and that is not going to guarantee your body will produce the antibodies needed to fight off another infection of a larger viral load. 

What the vaccine does is create a controlled response to where a larger number of antibodies are produced, and a booster shot to allow for more to be developed in order to provide a longer duration of immunity, as well as a strong arsenal of antibodies that will likely keep you out of the hospital \*if\* you do happen to become infected. 

With the vaccine, doctors will be able to figure out when you will need a future booster in order to stay immune, and there's really not a scheduling method for randomly being infected by the virus.",ncspba,2021-05-16 21:11:15

The information I found was all after December so thats quite possibly the case,ncspba,2021-05-15 14:36:10
I haven't been able to find anything that says there's almost zero level of antibodies in asymptomatic cases. I've found studies stating almost the complete opposite.

"This study you referenced has healthcare workers asymptomatic alright but they were continuously exposed to the coronavirus over months, not just one episode of  exposure to the virus. It's like getting multiple booster doses of the vaccine, not just one dose. Hope you are getting the point.
Best bet is you can look for antibodies in your blood before taking the jab.",ncspba,2021-05-15 17:07:17
I think I understand what you're saying. Does that process differ from the process of how natural immunity would work? Obviously the live virus isn't weakened in the case that you contracted it.,ncspba,2021-05-15 17:14:21
I understand the similarity to the booster shot. My whole thing is if I have antibodies I shouldn't need the vaccine should I? It wouldn't serve much of a purpose.

"I promise I'm not trying to be difficult. This just isn't my area of expertise as I havent paid much attention to the vaccines until recently.

To my understanding the vaccine uses the exact same process as a natural infection. Would this be correct? If that is correct both should lead to immunity

The way I am seeing it right now is that my I get the vaccine. I am now immune. My imaginary identical twin brother gets infected and recovers at the same time as I get my vaccine.

I guess I dont understand why there's talk about not requiring face masks for fully vaccinated people.

"You people need a serious refresher on history.

Thalidomide was first marketed in the late 1950s as a sedative. It was given to pregnant women to help them overcome morning sickness - but it damaged babies in the womb, restricting the growth of arms and legs. About 10,000 Thalidomide babies were born worldwide until the drug was withdrawn in the early 1960s. 

Facing thousands of lawsuits alleging that its talc caused cancer, J&J insists on the safety and purity of its iconic product. But internal documents examined by Reuters show that the company's powder was sometimes tainted with carcinogenic asbestos and that J&J kept that information from regulators and the public.

The problem began when the city switched its water supply in 2014. Almost immediately, residents of Flint — a majority-black city where 40 percent of people live in poverty — started complaining about the quality of the water. City and state officials denied for months that there was a serious problem.

By that time, supply pipes had sustained major corrosion and lead was leaching into the water. The city switched back to its original water supply late last year, but it was too late to reverse the damage to the pipes.

High blood lead levels are especially harmful to children and pregnant women, and can cause ""learning disabilities, behavioral problems and mental retardation,"" the World Health Organization says.",ncb7qi,2021-05-15 23:21:44

I am on the fence, too.  I think those that are hesistant (myself included) might be more likely to get it, if ""they"" would be more transparent with the public about the deaths that are reported in VAERS (although I understand that not all of those have been caused by the vaccine; it could just be timing). Or tell the public what happened in the deaths (not J&J) that 'have' been reported in the media, like the doctor in Florida and the single mom who was a tech for a plastic surgeon in Utah, that both died after getting a vaccine.

Even though I'm on the fence, I'm also worried about getting Covid and have delayed needed medical care the past 14 months because of that. But I am still leaning more toward getting it, because a friend's Mom just died yesterday from Covid.  That makes two family members and 3 relatives of friends who have died this year.   I have stayed safe this entire time, mainly because I have stayed home and worn a mask while out for doctor's appts.  But I worry if my luck might change now, since the CDC has said that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, and we all know that in order for masks to be the most effective, everyone has to wear them.

"Yes, I did.  I got Pfizer at the Travis County Expo Center on Sunday.  It was a drive thru event and my son was with me.  I started to have an allergic reaction within a seconds which got worse after a few minutes (all over body itching and throat tightness).  I had told them when we checked in that I have a history of allergic reactions and so our car was directed to a different waiting area.  I had about 7-8 military personnel standing around my car (I am assuming National Guard, but not sure), keeping an eye on me and checking in from time to time.  I was told to take 2 benadryl.  My oxygen (measured by pulse ox) was fine the entire time, but my pulse went to 58 at one point.  They kept me for observation for about 45 min until my symptoms abated once the benadryl kicked in.  All in all, I felt in good hands; although now I'm a little more nervous about getting my second shot.  I feel like there was a ton of staff there to help if needed, but not sure how close that location is to a hospital, if that's what I would end up needing next time. I think the nearest hospital is 20 min away per Google. I had more rescue meds with me, but didn't need to take them (prednisone, H1/H2 and two epi-pens). Hopefully next time will be about the same, although sometimes allergic reactions can be worse for subsequent exposure. All in all, I've had much worse allergic reactions; I think the fear for me was that it might get worse after I left, which thankfully, it did not.

General resume (AstraZeneca):

Norwegian-Danish study of rare side effects in connection with AstraZeneca vaccination published
...The results show that there were increased rates of venous blood clots in the brain (cerebral venous thrombosis) in the first 28 days after vaccination. The researchers found that one additional case occurred for every 40,000 vaccinated. The risk of venous thrombosis (blood clots) in general was also increased by about one additional case for every 9,000 vaccinated...

Long-Term Survival in a Large Cohort of Patients with Venous Thrombosis: Incidence and Predictors

...Venous thrombosis is known to be associated with considerable short-term morbidity and mortality: the mortality rate after venous thrombosis is about 20% within one year and studies to date have suggested that the mortality rate is two to four times higher for patients with pulmonary embolism, of whom 10%–20% die within three months after the event..

...736 participants (601 patients and 135 controls) died over a follow-up of 54,948 person-years. The overall mortality rate was 22.7 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 21.0–24.6) for patients and 4.7 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.0–5.6) for controls. Patients with venous thrombosis had a 4.0-fold (95% CI 3.7–4.3) increased risk of death compared with controls. The risk remained increased up to 8 years after the thrombotic event, even when no additional comorbidities were present...

I’ve done both. It won’t hurt it but the stress on your immune system from the vaccine might not clear the ink as quickly. I’d wait about 4 weeks after your last vaccine to do another session. You’re better off getting the vaccine now and not getting Covid later like I did. Catching Covid messed my immune system and tattoo clearing more.

[deleted],n9nbwc,2021-05-11 17:03:21
">Why cant they be sued ?

They absolutely can be.  The process is go through vaccine court first.  If vaccine court doesn't provide you the relief you seek, then you can file a civil lawsuit against the vaccine manufacturer (and the health care provider that administered the vaccine).  

Furthermore, the vaccines for COVID-19 are being distributed globally.  The vast majority of countries on the planet do not have vaccine courts.  Of 195 countries in the world, 19 have vaccine courts.  The rest, it's up to the individual to sue in civil court.  Guess which countries have the greatest number of payouts?  Those with vaccine courts.  Why?  Because you'd get absolutely stomped in civil court by a sea of lawyers and medical experts working for vaccine companies to the point that you'd owe millions in legal fees.

>Is it because these vaccines are expiremental and you take them at your own risk ?

No.  Again, you an sue in civil court.  But you must go through vaccine court first (in the 19 countries that have vaccine court...you're on your own in the other countries).  Vaccine court is your best option for compensation as you'll lose in civil court.",n9nbwc,2021-05-12 16:05:22

"ITs not just a story, it is proven true. 

1. Historical facts

Look at all the archeological findings that show the Bible is true

\-Babylon (which is mentioned in the Old Testament) was excavated between 1899 and 1917 by a German team led Robert Koldewey.  

\-The Dead Sea Scrolls which were found in 1947 by Shepherds in a cave on the Western side of the Dead Sea. These contained over 800 documents written in Hebrew along with fragments of 190 Biblical Scrolls, and a complete word for word copy of Isaiah was also found along with almost the Entire Old Testament books.

\-The Tel Dan Inscription which was discovered in 1993. This stone was found with the inscription ""*BYTDWD""* Which scholars have concluded either means ""House of David"" or refers to the lineage of David. The term ""House of David"" is actually used in Scripture

Isaiah 22:22 ""   The key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; So he shall open, and no one shall shut; And he shall shut, and no one shall open.""

\-Hezekiah's Tunnel which was the dependable water source for Jerusalem was found in 1867 by Charles Warren. This is Specifically mentioned in 2 Chronicles 32 when it says ""blocking the source of the waters of the upper Gihon, and leading them straight down on the west to the City of David""

Look at the Historical Proof

\-History proves Jesus existed. There are people outside of the Bible who wrote that Jesus existed. 

 Cornelius Tacitus who was a Roman Senator said:

""\[N\]either human effort nor the emperor’s generosity nor the placating of the gods ended the scandalous belief that the fire had been ordered \[by Nero\]. Therefore, to put down the rumor, Nero substituted as culprits and punished in the most unusual ways those hated for their shameful acts … whom the crowd called “Chrestians.” The founder of this name, Christ, had been executed in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate … Suppressed for a time, the deadly superstition erupted again not only in Judea, the origin of this evil, but also in the city \[Rome\], where all things horrible and shameful from everywhere come together and become popular.""

The Bible and this says that Jesus was Crucified by Pilate. So, check that off the evidence list. 

Josephus, a Jewish priest, who was involved with three Roman Emperors said this:

""Being therefore this kind of person \[i.e., a heartless Sadducee\], Ananus, thinking that he had a favorable opportunity because Festus had died and Albinus was still on his way, called a meeting \[literally, “sanhedrin”\] of judges and brought into it the brother of Jesus-who-is-called-Messiah … James by name, and some others. He made the accusation that they had transgressed the law, and he handed them over to be stoned""

Historical records show that James was martyred, so again, check!

He also said:

""Around this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man.21 For he was one who did surprising deeds, and a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. When Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing among us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who in the first place came to love him did not give up their affection for him, for on the third day, he appeared to them restored to life. The prophets of God had prophesied this and countless other marvelous things about him. And the tribe of Christians, so called after him, have still to this day not died out.""

Celsus, the Platonist philosopher, considered Jesus to be a magician who made exorbitant claims

Pliny the Younger, a Roman governor and friend of Tacitus, wrote about early Christian worship of Christ “as to a god.”

None of these writings are in the Bible and most of these people were not Believers, but they knew Jesus existed. 

Also, think about this. Now that you know (but you can still deny) that Jesus truly did exist and was killed exactly as the Bible says, why can't we find one bit of DNA of him after he died? Why can't we find any evidence of his bones or sin? Either he neve existed (which I have just proven to you that he did, or he really did rise from the dead, he was who he said he was. 

Look at the common sense evidence:

If the Bible is not real and God does not exist and this is all an accident: then why is everything placed so perfectly to sustain life on Earth. If Evolution is true, then why don't we see fish turning into dogs or vice verse? Dogs and fish may change, but they are still dogs and fish, they do not evolve into other species. Why are humans considered the highest level of Evolution if other animals are faster and stronger than we are. 

A cheetah can run 50-80 MPH, a Horse can run 55 MPH, a cat and German Shepherd can run 30 MPH, while humans can only run 28 which is the highest recorded. 

The Bible says that we are made in the image of God, and that we are special to God. But the Bible also says that we are sinners and have broken the laws of God. But God loved us, so he sent Jesus to the Earth to die on the cross for our sins. Jesus died, was buried and three days later he rose from the dead and the Bible says that anyone who puts their faith and trust in him will have Eternal Life:

Romans 10:9 ""If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.""",n9xvgj,2021-05-11 18:47:55

"I got the same issue as you except I think mine is more severe. I had the hives and rashes develop 3 days after my 2nd Moderna injection. I was taking Claritin and benodryl for a week. I decided to not take the meds for a day. I had full body hives and rashes that covered my face as well. Went to a doctor. Don’t have me 1 week dose of steroids. After the dose wore off, my hands, face and throat swelled up. Went to the dermatologist recently. Gave me stronger steroids. On the heaviest dose, I still break out......

I took the tobacco and rubbed it on my skin(like a poison ivy) and it turns out it turns red and swells up.

I would recommend monitoring it but don't worry too much. Lots of people have changes to periods after the vaccine. I've heard of people being heavy, having it last longer and some people have skipped periods since vaccination.

I had the worst cramps I’ve ever had starting the first day, and the first two days it was kind of light spotting. After that it became the heaviest it’s ever been to the point that I couldn’t go to work. TMI but during the last couple days I had periods of time that would last a few hours where I was bleeding super heavy and had HUGE clots. It got so bad that there were a couple times I just gave up and sat on my toilet for a really long time. I wanted to go to the er but I was bleeding so heavily that I was afraid if I was stuck waiting for a long time I would bleed through my clothes so I just stuck it out at home.

"I’m with you that the vaccine has been giving a LOT of people cycle changes, and it’s worth mentioning to your doctor if you notice something and are concerned. However, I don’t think that just being around vaccinated people would cause these changes. You periods can change for any number of reasons....  change in diet, exercise frequency/intensity, being around other people menstruating, stress levels, weather/seasons, and tons of other stuff.

"The one thing you might want to consider is variants. We’re never going to see an end to this virus as long as it has a chance to mutate in people and create variants, some of which are far more deadly and way easier to transmit. The variants happen among people who get the virus, even if they themselves are healthy and don’t end up getting that sick. For example, they traced the UK variant to one guy who had the virus for an extended period of time, which allowed it to mutate in his body. This variant is far more contagious and has caused deaths all over the world. It’s become the prominent strain in my state, Michigan, and has wreaked havoc here. 

So far, the vaccines have shown to be effective at protecting against the known variants, but this can always change, which would put vaccinated people like your parents at risk. It’s just something to think about. You may not get sick yourself, but you could become an incubator for the next variant that has the potential to affect all of us.",n86cw1,2021-05-09 15:52:24

"TLDR: You deserve to be informed and reddit (or any social media) is NOT the place to seek that information. Have your parents schedule an appointment with your doctor so you can have your questions answered.

Honestly, this isn't the place to be asking this as these subs have a ridiculous number of unbased skeptics and anti vaxxers... Which is evidenced in the comments here so far.

Your best resource is your doctor. From what I know, the reasons you list for not wanting the vaccine have no basis in science. You haven't gotten or felt sick because the majority of the world has been social distancing. As more people get vaccinated that will change and things will open up.

The symptoms caused by the shot do not last long, about 2 days for me. Some people don't even have any symptoms.

If you get covid after getting vaccinated you will be fine. If you get covid without getting vaccinated there is a chance you will die.

I would 100% ask your parents to schedule a doctors visit so you can ask your questions to an expert.

"Talk to your physician,  It is new and data is changing daily.  Follow your gut.  Someone below said to look at Vears data and it's easy to sort the data by criteria if you choose to look into it further.  Some questions I would like to ask are to gage their reaction... 

&#x200B;

* Is it known whether cross-reacting antibodies from previous coronavirus infections or vaccine-induced antibodies can **influence the risk of unintended pathogenesis after vaccination** with COVID-19?
* Has the specific risk of ADRs, immunopathology, autoimmunity, and serious adverse reactions been clearly disclosed to vaccine recipients to meet the medical ethics standard of patient understanding for **informed consent**? If not, what are the reasons and how could it be implemented?
* What is the **rationale for administering the vaccine to each individual** when the risk of dying from COVID-19 is not equal across age groups and clinical conditions and when the phase 3 trials excluded the elderly, children, and frequent specific conditions?
* What are the legal rights of patients if they are harmed by a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? Who will cover the costs of medical treatment? If claims were to be settled with public funds, has the public been informed that vaccine manufacturers have been granted immunity and that their **responsibility to compensate those harmed by the vaccine has been transferred to taxpayers**?",n86cw1,2021-05-11 21:31:34

No you should not get it if you don't want it. Once you get it you can't undo it. This is an experimental vaccine and has not had long term studies. Most young people have a 99.9% chance of surviving COVID. As long as they are healthy and their genetics matter as well. When a virus mutates it becomes weaker and not stronger so less deadly but maybe more contagious. Everyone has lost their god damn minds when it comes to covid and their common sense. It's your body don't let other people pressure you into doing something you don't. Your body your choice.,n86cw1,2021-05-10 05:12:23
"Its good you're recognizing that social pressure alone is not enough to drive significant decision making... like your health care choices.  
There's a lot of information out there on this vaccine and a lot of speculation as well as ""we don't know/there's no evidence of long term risk, so therefore there's not any"". 

For situations like this I'd evaluate your current and future lifestyle risk with respect to covid and also consider reviewing any concerns or questions you have with your doctor... maybe get a yearly physical and use that as an opportunity to ask. New technology and rapidly designed vaccines do have some uncertainty. What we do know is these vaccines have been pretty successful and low risk thus far and a ton of people have taken them.

It depends on your risk level because if you're in a environment with high covid cases or exposure to other people in close quarters its a much different risk level than a place that has very low numbers. Also they aren't really clear about now long the m-rna vaccine is effective for. I've read recently that maybe 6 months effective.  For some people the simple thought of ""ahh in vaccinated"" is good enough to bring peace of mind for the time being until theres a little spike later and they push the booster shots. 

If you want a more conventional vaccine then you could wait for the novavax which might not be available until later this year. Theres always risk with any option you take though... so really it's just up to you with which risks you're willing to take.",n86cw1,2021-05-09 06:05:27

Yeah, this is all about you again. Your reaction, IF it is even caused by the vaccine, is not typical. If I were you I would get a covid test, it's not unheard of for people to get covid between doses of the vaccine.

"This is why you need to have a trusted primary care doctor that you can go to. Start getting your yearly physical and ask questions. They know your health and have the competency (if you trust them) to determine what level of priority you should place on something new like the covid vaccine. That's what I did and it was a good idea to get baseline of my health before taking it as well. My doctor was very informative and unbiased with what concerns should exist with the vaccines and why... as an individual.  Remember that government and company bodies look at you as a drop in the bucket out of the millions and are willing to take risks ""for the greater good"" even if that means some will suffer.  If you want to prioritize your individual life, which in America you are allowed to still, then talk to your doctor to validate your research and ask questions.  Its all just a risk calculation and it depends on your lifestyle and health and community covid risk. 
They clearly don't really know how long these vaccines last so if covid cases are very low in your community and you don't do a lot of high risk activities and you're healthy young person maybe its not worth it.",n84e61,2021-05-13 12:59:25
"The thing is this what I can't understand is why when someone has a different opinion of someone else the other person attacks them. Here's what it is they came up with a vaccine and a short. Of time if you remember clearly they even report on CP24 that they're going to be studying for the next few years a long-term effects cuz they can't know the long-term effects because it hasn't happened yet so there's one point I'd like to hear something about that. Second place you're going to tell me that those government officials had this vaccine that is the biggest joke in the universe they are not going to take it because they don't know the effects which means that they won't be here to lead the country's as screwed up as they want to lead them they're not taking the vaccine I can hundred percent guarantee on that. I'm just so sick and tired if someone decides not to take it and making them feel like they're doing something wrong I don't think so who's going to take care of my family if I play Russian roulette with my life with this vaccine , at least I can prevent getting covid once that garbage is in my system can you take it out? Are you going to step up and take care of my family? The vaccines are approved for emergency use only that's why they can approve them fully because it hasn't been enough time get it so there's no need to be rude and use bad words and call people names it just shows the type of people that people are if they can't have a civil conversation or civil debate",n84e61,2021-05-23 13:54:44

"Yourself, to do your own research. It blows my mind that people complain constantly about how the governments are screwing them in normal times, yet listen intently when an emergency arises and chastise those that think for themselves in times like this. Listen, politicians are just people, like you and me. They make mistakes, like you and me. The OP is opening something for discussion here. Closing that door in their face is a huge issue throughout this pandemic. Being a mindless follower of a political structure that seeks to screw you out of your hard earned money at every turn, yet following every word they say now is kind if silly. Honestly, they don’t know whats going on either. The OP and everyone else here has the right to know EXACTLY what they are putting into their bodies. Until that is known, conversation about it is open season. 

As for ‘health experts’ look back 30-40 years and what has been said about what foods you should be eating. FDA approved foods that hit the shelves have caused the most sick population on the planet in North America, you’re going to jump in bed with that, no questions asked when it comes to a pandemic????",n84e61,2021-05-10 13:49:53
No. It's not about trust it's about informed decisions. Health experts can only give you all the evidence and then you will make an informed decision. But in this mess  neither is happening. Your comment about government is way off. No one ever should trust government. Government shouldn't be trusted but controlled at every decision they make and scrutinised.  But this has gone away with all the panic. Mass media only replicating official lines ad nauseam and are failing to hold to account anything related to pandemic decisions.,n84e61,2021-05-17 00:30:29
"Anecdotal evidence is not the same thing.

Also, there were several women who became pregnant during the covid vaccine trials. The only one who lost the baby due to miscarriage was given the placebo.

"What's your own research lol. I don't trust 99% of most people to even be able to comprehend what scientific journals are even saying about this stuff, because it's extremely complex, no mom on face book should be able to understand it. Also, the government isn't making the vaccine, it's just distributing it, and the numbers for the vaccine play out quite favorably. The vaccine is also free for anybody, so where's this money incentive. I like how you mention nutritional science as your reference to not trust experts. For one, not every science is equal and It tells me you actually don't know anything about how their tests are extremely hard to measure accurately and the amount of people who were actually in that field at the time. But I guess you didn't do your own research on that one lol. Everything you've said here is whiney garbage that actually benefits nobody involved so thank you for wasting our time.",n84e61,2021-05-10 20:18:41

"Distributing it approved by whom again? Oh right, the exact same people that have made a sick population in the first place. Honestly, I could care less about the science behind it at this point. The sheer amount of ailments on this sub are enough for me to stay away from it for quite some time. I will and do prefer to eat properly, exercise, and take my vitamins instead. Am I running around licking gas pumps, no. But getting in the front of the line for something rammed through this quick is a mistake.

My analogy on this concept is this: a company comes out with a new and exciting product, you run out and buy it, excited! A year later that product has 10000 recalls with various outcomes. Gen 2 comes out fixing the bugs and has 2000 recalls. Gen 3 comes out, superior to both and only has 200 recalls. Im not anti vaccine whatsoever, but I am anti-first in line. No one, I mean No One gets it right the first time around. Mark my words.

Edit: also to add, if your vaccinated and I’m not what difference does it make to you if you run into me in public. If you believe in your shot then why worry about me getting it? My body my choice, I can care less what the sheep say.",n84e61,2021-05-10 20:30:38

"The government is the most efficient means to distribute the vaccine, how does that effect the vaccine's effectiveness. Unless you're alluding to a process in between the government to the people which would only be conspiracy at that point lol. Also wdym the same people who made the population sick? Is that a metaphor or more conspiracy lol. You're also using this sub as a reference for the negative consequences of the vaccine yet most people recovered fine and you'll only find the ones going out of their way to complain on here, so your sample is flawed. I agree most people don't get something right the first time, but do you think this is the first time someone made a vaccine? They used the same processes to discover how to trigger your body's immune systems to it as every other vaccine, although there are some small differences. The sheep comment is pretty funny considering that what your saying just suggests you're a sheep just to a different herder",n84e61,2021-05-10 21:06:37

I don't think the government is this pure fucking entity from the sky, but I'd trust a government scientific agency over your pseudo-wokism every day of the week. Especially if it's a topic you know literally nothing about. No 15 minute google search is going to give you a degree in research or the medical field. Don't waste your time saying you care about me when you clearly don't care about what I say.

Seriously? Why take the vaccine if normal won't even come back? Answer my question,n84e61,2021-05-09 04:20:59
"First you cant say anyone has ‘recovered’ fine. Its been weeks not months or years lol. Smoking was thought as good at one point remember that? Lsd was tried as a mind control substance to control soldiers at one point, preformed by whom again? Hell, cocaine was in coca cola originally. You think we are past trial and error, man you’re blind. Its all trial and error with hindsight being 20/20. Second, I’m not a conspiracy theorist, what I do is pay attention to how the world works on a day to day basis over the course of my lifetime. If I was elderly yes, I’d be getting it. Like I already said, I’m not anti-vaccine whatsoever so no I don’t think its a big intentional conspiracy. I am the herder of myself and my conclusion has been made. Will I get it down the road, possibly, but I value and respect my body to a great degree. So waiting to see whats up is my outlook. Generally speaking over history in general, what the masses agree hastily on is rarely correct over time (take a look at history, its a mess). I don’t care if you think you’re smarter than I am or not. What I am doing is trying to make people think for themselves, weigh different opinions and options, and maybe take a little more care in taking care of the vehicle you were given for life. Take your vitamins, exercise, and respect your body and covid will be a non issue. Why do I need anything more than that? Never had a flu shot, no h1n1 either. Weird how I’m rarely sick and didn’t get the bird flu. You’re running on panic mode without thinking the entire scenario through fully. You’re scared I get it.",n84e61,2021-05-10 21:24:27
Thank you for proving my point pal.,n84e61,2021-05-18 00:55:36
"There's no real indication yet that herd immunity is not possible. Vaccines definitely are the way to that. Even if it weren't, looking at countries with massive vaccination rates, things have started to get back to normal while keeping almost pre-covid mortality rates.

"I am in a category where I'm the least likely to die, if I got Covid I would be 100% fine, so no I'm not scared first. Second, what you're saying is a very poor representation of the past. Doctors generally had a lack of evidence to show negative health affects so companies used that lack of knowledge to push a product, since obviously you don't get cancer immediately. Also, Vaccines have an entirely separate history to all the drugs you mentioned previously, they're literally one of the biggest advancements in medical history. You just conflated 4 different things that have nothing to do with vaccines. Your anti-government sentiment is harming the people who have worked day and night to prevent something that has had a great harm to our society.

At least the vaccine has gone through trials - covid is doing its own trial on our population and it is doing quite a doozy.   If areas keep on spreading we don’t know what could happen.

The pharma companies are not liable for any adverse impacts or long-term impacts, unfortunately.

Thanks for replying. I think cos I had the usual side effects with the first shot and they were within the first 24/48 hours and then it was done. This didn’t really start until 48 hours after so thought it was a bit strange. Hopefully it will run its course soon enough.,n7qbkp,2021-05-08 18:04:56

Being vaccinated doesn’t stop you from getting COVID or reduce it being transmitted at all. It only prevents you from being hospitalized. You can still contract and pass to someone with or without a vaccine. I have the vaccine myself so don’t thing I’m anti what ever but why does it matter to inform others of his choice?,n7627r,2021-05-07 21:09:44
"Is your question should you disclose his status to family and friends, or how to get him to turn hesitance into action?

"You have both rationally thought about the vaccine and you have come to different conclusions. It's okay. You are both able to reason leading you to consent to different things and it's fine. In that same way, I think he should personally choose how to disclose this information. He's an adult and capable of making his own decisions by himself. I'm worried that you might be infantilizing your partner by wanting to decide on the disclosure for him. I'm also worried that you subconsciously intend to shame his choice by threatening to disclose his medical information to others. Medical information is private matter and in the worse case scenario, he'll choose to disclose it.",n7627r,2021-05-07 23:16:23
"My questions are the following; how do I handle friends being judgmental (he would like to be open and disclose this to anyone he comes in close contact with)? I wonder if I should let him do what he wants or try to convince him? I'll admit that he lack of being vaccinated makes me anxious and it's disappointing to not be able to leave the house to do things together outside of a few safe options. 

He is hesitant because, although well researched, mRNA being a new technology, lack of FDA approval, he believes that there may be systemic scrubbing of side effects in the media, and since he doesn't need to leave the house he doesn't think it's worth the risk.",n7627r,2021-05-07 21:13:18

DO NOT LET HIM TAKE IT,n7627r,2021-05-23 10:57:23
">reduce it being transmitted at all

I believe you are misinformed, although this is a common misconception. https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/6-myths-about-covid-19-vaccines-debunked

>why does it matter to inform others of his choice?

Many reasons why it might. The more people that get the virus the greater the chance that a mutation occurs. This can lead to variants that have the potential to reach immune escape. Those who are unable to get the vaccine are protected by a bubble of vaccinated people around them (heard immunity). And last, a covid positive individual is still a threat to vaccinated individuals, just not as big as they are to unvaccinated individuals.",n7627r,2021-05-07 21:16:06
Sorry for the confusion- the decision to disclose to others was made by him and I don't share his personal info,n7627r,2021-05-08 00:01:03
"Like above, he still can get Covid, spread Covid perhaps even to you, and that is what will keep this pandemic going. Pfizer is going for full FDA approval now, so maybe this part won't be an issue for him soon. Hundreds of millions of people have been safely inoculated though. Getting the pandemic under control is by getting as many people vaccinated as soon as possible. Like 70% of the people.

With that being said, some people will probably judge and want to not mingle. Not much you can do about that.  It is his choice to live in a very restricted way, but how do you feel about living like that too? What if that is how he really likes to live? Are you okay with potentially being barred from doing things as a couple? You cannot control what others think, or choose to do, but can control how /if you live in it.

Perhaps you should to consider is: Is this a dealbreaker? If you truly stand by him, then do it, stand firm and see how it plays out. If you want more out of your life that vaccines provide right now you should have a real talk with him about what this means for you.

Edit to say: I am sorry this is a tough one. Best of luck you him and you. Stay safe.",n7627r,2021-05-07 21:44:44
"People being judgemental is something you can't really change, unfortunately, you can only really handle it gracefully. I'd just say ""we've thought about it a lot and made our choices"" and leave it at that. If they want to have a discussion about it, engage with them calmly and politely. If you don't want to get into it with people, I'd recommend not disclosing his unvaccinated status, but if he wants to, that is his choice. If people start being pushy, you can remind them that getting vaccinated is ultimately a personal choice, and that he is neither legally required not morally obligated to get vaccinated, and that spending time with him (or not) is their choice as well.

It sounds like he's thought about it a lot, has legitimate concerns, and his mind is made up. I wouldn't try to convince him unless you want to get into more arguments. Maybe you can leave it alone for a little while, then try again later? If it eases your anxiety a little, remember that the vaccine is extraordinarily effective, so you should be protected even if he gets it, and if you get it, you're unlikely to spread it to him. It sounds like he's being really careful, so hopefully that puts him at less risk. Also, SO many people are getting the vaccine, which will also protect him.",n7627r,2021-05-08 20:23:07
"I see. I am also wondering why you are saying that he is vaccine hesitant in the context where he actually made his decision not to get the vaccine right away. He's not currently hesitant, he made a decision and it's okay if he sticks to it. He will get the vaccine in the future if he wants. By labeling his stance as vaccine hesitancy, you are implying that his position is less legitimate.",n7627r,2021-05-08 02:31:05

Which one did you get?,n661h9,2021-05-08 10:30:40
Probably no but consult with your doctor. You don’t want your immune system fighting two separate things at once. Probably lowers the efficacy.,n6i80l,2021-05-06 23:01:27

I have asthma as well, and I work in a hospital and see day to day that the vaccines are personally too early to tell. In a few years down the road I will see how it progresses before getting it, it's called an emergency vaccine for a reason and can't be mandated currently in most places due to that. I'm for a vaccine, I would just say make sure you either need it or if you are super unhealthy maybe get it. It has a 50% chance of working for most of them. If you're healthy, let your immune system build and get stronger before harming it with a vaccine.",n653yg,2021-05-07 01:13:16

"Suppression of the scientific truth! Recent evidence that SM-102 is in these experiments. Google fact checkers says its a safe vax ingredient but if you cross reference the actual osha data sheet it reveals its not to be given to animals or people. SM-102 is basically fatty lipid molecules the mrna rests in with an outer portion being chloroform. Once the chloroform enters the blood stream in interacts with arterial oxygen converting to phosgene. Phosgene was used in ww1 as a weapon. Phosgene is a neurotoxin. Once the chloroform crosses the blood brain barrier and translates to phosgene it attacks the frontal lobe causing once rare prion disorders. Many vids out there of ppl shaking like a leaf and having massive seizures. No known antidote to phosgene. Newsweek downplayed this by saying it was only used as a solvent. Still shouldn't be in the vax's! Gets worse the heart attacks, strokes and clots the experiments cause are from the down regulation of ace 2 receptors causing endothelial damage. All four experiments do this. This was revealed in a scientific study concluded in April. These results are now being published in Cardio-Pulmonary medical journals. Everyone's talking about bleeding more after taking this. Even more it is proven the experiments change dna by the fact people are becoming magnetic by the replication of nano particulates in the hosts cells. Many vids coming out with ppl putting magnets on their arms. I have lost my first amendment rights on platforms trying to warn others, my comments are censored and removed. Media is openly calling this all lies. The unvaccinated will be blamed for what these experiments are causing. Potus even said the unvaccinated will be the one to pay the price. What I am saying is the real truth pharmaceutical and govt. entities do not want made known. When fda licences these experiments states will assume power to fire from employment, restrict from employment and eventually mandate to buy and sell. If your worried about covid 19 virus all you need is inhalable budesonide! Please watch the latest Texas Senate Covid hearing you will see some smart people are trying to get the truth out but its being suppressed and we are being called conspiracy theorist. Its a fact five thousand people have died from these experiments its all on vaers website yet the media still waving the flag of safety over them and saying zero serious side effects. Each month since inception has progressively revealed higher data! I hope you see this before its erased. Again they do not want the truth known or spread.

"Thank you! Good luck with everything. 

Do realize that you may have some covid shot side effects, that are normal to the shots, since our bodies have never dealt with covid before. 

&#x200B;

but having asthma shouldn't be a contributing factor. Although spring is (allergy season). LOL",n653yg,2021-05-07 04:54:19
"I was nervous too but I got mine last week (J&J) and I’m completely fine now! For about 24 hours I was feeling under the weather, didn’t sleep well, mild headache, low energy, but then after 1-2 days I really felt back to normal and completely fine. 30F, on birth control for reference. 

Biggest advice is: 
1. HYDRATE! Before getting it and 48 hours after. I mean really hydrate. Alternate between water, electrolyte drink like Pedialyte or low sugar Powerade or something similar, water again. 
2. Move around your arm after the shot during your 15-minute monitoring period. It’ll help with soreness. Try to continue to move it around all day in circles or lifting small things up. 
3. Take it easy but go on walks if you’re up for it. 
4. Deep breaths! In the very off chance you have severe symptoms (from what I’ve read you’ll know they are severe), don’t hesitate to contact a doctor asap, even just to check in. 
That said, it is more than likely you will be 100% fine. Most people experience side effects for 24 hours and maybe have to take a Tylenol but then they are fine. Keep in mind most people come to these threads when something goes wrong, not the millions for who things went right. That’s uneventful and not noteworthy. Deep breaths, get some extra sleep if you can, and HYDRATE. You’ll do great!",n5k1lj,2021-05-05 19:21:02
"I am now 2 weeks past my second dose. I got pfizer, and it went even better than expected. Based on what I'd read on Reddit, I was nervous so I took the next day off to recover after both my vaccines. They went super smoothly. The first one, my arm was sore for a few days (which happens to me after every vaccine). I got kind of tired the day of, but to be fair, I'm always tired, so who knows if it was even a vaccine side effect. After the second one, my arm was sore for less time even, took a nap and felt back to 100% the next morning. 

Drink plenty of water and relax. The second time I was more relaxed when getting the shot, and I didn't even feel it.",n5k1lj,2021-05-05 19:26:39
No worries. You’ll do great,n5k1lj,2021-05-05 18:50:08
"I got mine already and it’s not nearly as bad as I expected after hearing people talk! The shot itself doesn’t hurt at all. I got no symptoms after the first dose (besides a sore arm the next day as with any shot) and the second wasn’t too bad either. I didn’t get super sick, just felt a bit tired and blah for a day and then I was back to normal. Just have some Tylenol and water on hand and you’ll be perfectly fine",n5k1lj,2021-05-05 19:31:54
"I’m starting to wonder about all the misinformation out there. It seems as if those who are against the vaccine are willing to do (or say) anything to keep others from getting it. 

Just hydrate ahead of time and bring something to focus on while you wait. My side effects from the Pfizer vaccine were pretty mild; nothing that a dose of Tylenol couldn’t help. I’m sure you’ll do great!",n5k1lj,2021-05-05 20:40:22
"It will be fine, like you said, a lot of misinformation on here. People only posting negative, exaggerating side effects. I know so many people that had no side effects at all.",n5k1lj,2021-05-05 17:47:24
"I just got my first shot, (Moderna) yesterday and was insanely hungry afterward. I drank about 10 cups of water and ate a ton of food. I usually only eat 2 small meals and one big dinner a day. I had arm soreness as well. It’s almost gone today. My suggestion is to make sure to massage it and keep moving the arm in which you received the shot. Also was a lot more tired than usual but had a really good sleep session yesterday. (Note: I’ve been having sleep issues since February)

Hanging around this thread and then reading up on people’s experiences the day before my first shot was anxiety inducing. Didn’t help much, right after the shot that I had to chill in the waiting room with a ton of folks. (They had slides that talk about blood pressure and what it could do to you which didn’t help to calm me down much. Lol!) Admittedly, my anxiety was pretty high there, I thought it was the vaccine doing some weird things. Besides my anxiety symptoms which I’m pretty aware of, there’s been nothing out of the side-effects people have mentioned. I understand I’m lucky. I also know I’m not out of the woods yet for symptoms from this initial jab. Hopefully the second shot will be just as swift for me, but I’m always anticipating the worst. 

Hydrate a ton before and after. I also was taking vitamin D supplements since the beginning of the pandemic. If you can’t do that, just get at least 30 minutes of sunlight a day. And eat food! 

Hopefully, your initial shot goes well. If not, it’s most likely your immune system adjusting and understanding the mechanism in which Covid19 infects us. Hopefully with that in the back of your mind, the physical feelings won’t be as harsh. 

Hope it goes well!",n5k1lj,2021-05-05 22:22:25

"Transcript:

Hi, my name is Dr. Janci Chunn Lindsay. I hold a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biology from the University of Texas, and have over 30 years of scientific experience, primarily in toxicology and mechanistic biology.   In the mid-1990s, I aided the development of a temporary human contraceptive vaccine which ended up causing unintended autoimmune ovarian destruction and sterility in animal test models. Despite efforts against this and sequence analyses that did not predict this.   I strongly feel that all the gene therapy vaccines must be halted immediately due to safety concerns on several fronts.  

Janci Chunn Lindsay: Covid vaccines could induce cross-reactive antibodies to syncytin, and impair fertility as well as pregnancy outcomes First, there is a credible reason to believe that the Covid vaccines will cross-react with the syncytin and reproductive proteins in sperm, ova, and placenta, leading to impaired fertility and impaired reproductive and gestational outcomes.   Respected virologist Dr. Bill Gallaher, Ph.D., made excellent arguments as to why you would expect cross reaction. Due to beta sheet conformation similarities between spike proteins and syncytin-1 and syncytin-2.   I have yet to see a single immunological study which disproves this. Despite the fact that it would literally take the manufacturers a single day to do these syncytin studies to ascertain this \[once they had serum from vaccinated individuals\]. It’s been over a year since the assertions were first made that this \[the body attacking its own syncytin proteins due to similarity in spike protein structure\] could occur.  

 Pregnancy losses reported to VAERS lead to demand to halt Covid vaccine We have seen 100 pregnancy losses reported in VAERS as of April 9th. And there have \[also\] been reports of impaired spermatogenesis and placental findings from both the natural infection, vaccinated, and syncytin knockout animal models that have similar placental pathology, implicating a syncytin-mediated role in these outcomes.   Additionally, we have heard of multiple reports of menses irregularities in those vaccinated. These must be investigated.   We simply cannot put these \[vaccines\] in our children who are at .002% risk for Covid mortality, if infected, or any more of the child-bearing age population without thoroughly investigating this matter.  \[If we do\], we could potentially sterilize an entire generation. Speculation that this will not occur and a few anecdotal reports of pregnancies within the trial are not sufficient proof that this is not impacting on a population-wide scale.  

 Covid vaccine causes blood disorders Secondly, all of the gene therapies \[Covid vaccines\] are causing coagulopathy. \[Coagulopathy when the body’s blood clotting system is impaired.\] This is not isolated to one manufacturer. And this is not isolated to one age group.   As we are seeing coagulopathy deaths in healthy young adults with no secondary comorbidities.   There have been 795 reports related to blood clotting disorders as of April 9th in the VAERS reporting system, 338 of these being due to thrombocytopenia.  There are forward and backward mechanistic principles for why this is happening. 

The natural infection is known to cause coagulopathy due to the spike protein. All gene therapy vaccines direct the body to make the spike protein. Zhang et al in \[a scientific paper published in the Journal of Hematology & Oncology\] in September 2020 showed that if you infuse spike protein into mice that have humanized ACE-2 receptors on blood platelets that you also get disseminated thrombosis.   

Spike protein incubated with human blood in vitro also caused blood clot development which was resistant to fibrinolysis. \[Fibrinolysis is the body’s process of breaking down blood clots\]. The spike protein is causing thrombocytic events, which cannot be resolved through natural means. And all vaccines must be halted in the hope that they can be reformulated to guard against this adverse effect.   

Third, there is strong evidence for immune escape—

"**NOT** the Covid 19 vaccines.

She's not talking about vaccines to protect against Covid, she's referring to gene therapy.

OP, don't post **BULLSHIT TITLES**",n5rdun,2021-05-05 23:16:23
"The mRNA vaccine is technically gene therapy, and that's what she's referring to. It doesn't have to interact with DNA to be classified as such. When the technology first came out that was the terminology for mRNA tech. We just changed the wording over to vaccine, as people wouldn't be warm to the word gene therapy.",n5rdun,2021-05-05 23:58:20
She’s referring to MRNA Vaccines which both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are. Johnson and Johnson is the only one that used the older methods.,n5rdun,2021-05-06 16:43:54
"She's referring to gene therapy using virus vectors. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines deliver mRNA as *antigen coding,* - resulting in stimulation of the immune system - which is NOT 'gene therapy,' the modification of the human genome in some way. 

The vaccines *in no way* alter the genome.

Don't let the trolls lead you by the nose.",n5rdun,2021-05-06 16:48:25
"She specifically mentions the spike proteins that the moderna and pfizer vaccines create. Not to mention shes talking about covid mortality rates in children, dates line up with covid vaccinations. She 100% is talking about the Moderna and Pfizer Vaccines. Hands down",n5rdun,2021-05-06 16:52:32
"She's talking through her hat, conflating two separate things.",n5rdun,2021-05-06 17:09:04
"Nope, you just need to do more research before spreading misinformation. She is accurate and concrete in her description of the Covid-19 vaccines and how they are interacting with the body. I would delete your post and try again",n5rdun,2021-05-06 17:11:26
"People are going to die from all kinds of causes and for some people this will happen after they get vaccinated. Especially since the vast majority have been elderly people. Investigations into these deaths have found the vaccine did not cause the deaths. The only question mark has been the J&J/blood clot issue and that is extremely rare.

If you're going to get your info off of social media you're going to hear a lot of crap. Go to the CDC site, go to legit fact checking sites.

\*Just saw that it's Tucker Carlson spewing the false information about many deaths. Figures.",n5q3l3,2021-05-06 01:48:27

"There would be 1000 arguments to combat these claims and to speak to the overall positive effects, bur let's focus on the most important ones:
1. Your chance of dying of COVID or being hit by a bus instead of the vaccine is many, many times higher so this alone should be a good reason. Vaccine mortality rates are incredibly low, even if all the claims have a causal relationship which is statistically very improbable. In fact the vaccines you already went through when you were a baby/young carry a risk of death as well.
2. You must do this if you respect the people around you and you want to be a part of a civilized society.

I just got my second dose today. Feel like shit, which is to be expected especially on the second dose, but it is definitely worth it. I'm pretty sure I'm not dyin' cuz of this.",n5q3l3,2021-05-05 22:14:49
"Asthmatic here, got my first shot on the 16th of april, getting my 2nd dose today. Couldn't be happier.",n5q3l3,2021-05-07 14:10:18
Bottom line is that you have way more of a chance of dying from covid then from the vaccine. I have asthma too and that's exactly why I got the vaccine. Go get it for yourself and for other people.,n5q3l3,2021-05-05 23:55:51
People spread lies all the time get it you’ll be fine all my friends are 16-20 and we’ve gotten it and are all fine.,n5q3l3,2021-05-07 08:44:35
Definitely don’t get it - best advice you will get in your life,n5q3l3,2021-05-16 14:32:40
Yeah people ARE going to die from all kinds of causes but they like to blame everything on Covid.  Get off cnn and wake up,n5q3l3,2021-05-06 23:26:07
why was he vaccinated when none of the vaccines are approved for 15 year olds?,n5q3l3,2021-05-06 02:05:18
Uh. So I should take the vaccine even though I’m not high risk and at the very least have a bunch of nasty side effects?  F that.  Sheep.,n5q3l3,2021-05-06 23:27:28

I have a neighbor who is 35, in perfect health, and quite fit, who got COVID. He was in intensive care for one month, and can barely walk up a flight of stairs now. He would've been just fine after a vaccine. Most of my friends and family are doctors, who got COVID AND had the vaccine. Covid was worse, even though they are young, and the vaccine has worse side effects after you've already had the disease. Not to mention what they see every day.

"Have you actually had a look at mortality rates, overall, where there were serious and long term COVID outbreaks? Whether it often affects healthy people in serious ways or not is debatable (in my experience the incidence is higher than people think), the mortality rate has increased a lot since COVID. If you really care about those around you, why not get vaccinated and help lower overall population mortality? Even if it's someone that is overweight, someone that has suffered from a serious disease an recovered (like me, I'm 30 and I'm at risk because my previous illness could relapse if I get even a moderate COVID infection), or someone that is perfectly healthy. I don't think you actually have the medical or epidemiological knowledge to actually have a valid opinion here.

Doesn’t help my anxiety is kicking in because of hanging out in this sub prior and now after. Had a big lunch and drank about 4 cups of water after the shot. 

I drank lots of water and have been taking vitamin D since the beginning of the pandemic.

"I do feel light headed but it began about 8 hours after my second dose. In your case it was probably just anxiety as there was not enough time for the effects to kick in.

I fully support getting the vaccine and just got my second shot.

But I also just got diagnosed with fucking shingles (symptoms started in between shots before diagnosis) and let me tell you it hurts like a fucking bitch and there’s way too many similar cases for it not to be related. 

I’m only 30 and there’s a large number of young people (under the expected shingles risk age of 50-60+) getting it right now after getting the vaccine.

I don’t necessarily think that the covid vaccine causes shingles but that the stress of the vaccine on the body may cause a flare up of the shingles virus reactivating in your body.

I legit thought it was just an allergic reaction to something and that I was overreacting about the pain I was experiencing.",n4a9zi,2021-05-04 18:12:30

"Or just look on the VAERS website. Just because someone doesnt want a rushed experimental shot that isnt fully FDA approved doesnt make them anti-vax, it makes them skeptical on the issue. You arent special for getting the vaccine or calling people anti-vax. People who have gotten the vaccine have died from covid , people have died from the vaccine and have had bad symptoms. The real question is, what are the long term effects of this vaccine ? The answer is no one knows, another question, why is there no liability on the manufacturer and companies that made the vaccine if someone gets hurt from it, why cant you sue?",n4a9zi,2021-05-05 15:41:15
Just visit the CDC website and look up the reports with adverse events after taking covid vaccine. Not claiming the events are necessary linked but just by the sheer number of cases one should understand that side effects are hardly a lie...,n4a9zi,2021-05-06 10:03:43
I know I’m late but I had multiple siblings go to the er with their side effects.  One was fainting for 5-10 minutes every hour.  The other was having pretty bad trouble breathing.,n4a9zi,2021-05-08 18:03:45
"This. Similar to how people will leave reviews after a bad experience more than they tend to leave one after a good or neutral experience. Likely because when everything goes swimmingly, it tends to leave your mind  because that’s how it was supposed to go - nothing out of the ordinary and all that. When things go bad or not as expected, we feel gypped and make a complaint either with the hope that we’ll be made whole or at least validated; or just simply to warn others. When we commiserate together, we don’t feel so alone. 

Likewise, it gives us some perspective. Some people may have anxiety and know they have a tendency to overthink, overreact, or just get stuck in their own head so hearing someone else say, “I hear you and I understand” or “this was also my experience” helps us realize we’re not crazy or alone; and sometimes we come out on the other side with some useful coping advice. 

I also think it helps people who are or may be hesitant to get the vaccine so they know what they’re getting into ahead of time. The clinical view is cut-and-dry regarding side side effects but it lacks that human factor and doesn’t necessarily tell you the severity. There’s also not really any universal guidelines on how to deal with/treat the symptoms, if at all - or if a certain treatment you’d normally use is safe in this instance. Instead they just tell you to report any side effects and that’s it. It can seem like you’re just another number, which just further validates those who already think this is some “experiment”. Sure, you can ask your doctor, but majority of people aren’t getting vaccinated by their doctor or anyone they’re familiar with. There needs to be a human factor in my opinion. I don’t mean everyone should be coddled - I just mean they need to relay information like they’re talking to other humans rather than their fellow lab coats. There’s currently a clash of personalities between average people and scientists/doctors, and the trend is only growing. People want to feel like they at least matter. If they’re not getting that, they’re going to wonder why they should bother to help out; or why they should care about the greater good if those overseeing the greater good don’t seem to care.

The cut-and-dry/clinical outlook also doesn’t account for side effects that end up being rather common but weren’t shared initially, whether it was from lack of discovery due to inability to find a causal link, overlooked them due to other factors, or weren’t prevalent enough to be noteworthy or significant. So sharing negative experiences here allows those who are or may be hesitant to access more information - information that they’re not getting elsewhere - in order to be well-informed and decide what’s right for them. I think a lot of the reason people tend to distrust the science and those in the field is because they feel like they’re not being told the full truth or they feel like information is being directly withheld from them. Why would something need to be hidden if it was safe? (This is not my view; just my observation based on conversations I’ve had with some who are skeptical.) 

Theres a big disconnect going on and until that gap is bridged, I’m afraid the gap is only going to widen. Humans need connection and compassion. If you want people to listen, that’s the recipe. Talking to them in a robotic and seemingly unsympathetic manner isn’t going to do anyone any good.",n4a9zi,2021-05-04 15:55:11
"I don’t think it’s so black and white. For instance, I was originally in the “no symptoms” camp because I didn’t have symptoms the day of or the following day. In a sense I was wondering what the big deal was and then 2-days post vaxx, I was completely decommissioned and knocked on my butt. It felt like I got hit by a freight train. To the point where I wasn’t even up for getting on here and posting about them. Not because I didn’t want to but because I just didn’t have the energy to think or do anything. People tend to report things while they’re in the thick of it and then forget about it when it’s over. 

If I would’ve posted something here on the first or following day, it would’ve been “no symptoms!” but it would’ve been an entirely different story in the following days, but at that point I was too incapacitated to update the post. Then as I started feeling better, I was focused on other things and either forgot to update or by the time I remembered, I forgot how bad I felt while I was in the thick of it. Do you have kids? I mean, everyone would be one and done if we all remembered in explicit detail the pain of childbirth lol",n4a9zi,2021-05-04 16:08:15

When patients were directly asked and followed up with, they found that the side effects were more like 90%, and some are permanent even after discontinuation.)",n4a9zi,2021-05-04 16:57:50

"The Nuremberg Code (1947)

Permissible Medical Experiments
The great weight of the evidence before us to effect that certain types of medical experiments on human beings, when kept within reasonably well-defined bounds, conform to the ethics of the medical profession generally. The protagonists of the practice of human experimentation justify their views on the basis that such experiments yield results for the good of society that are unprocurable by other methods or means of study. All agree, however, that certain basic principles must be observed in order to satisfy moral, ethical and legal concepts:

1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.
The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.

2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.

3. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results justify the performance of the experiment.

4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.

5. No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.

6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.

7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death.

8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.

9. During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.

10.During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.",n3hw1f,2021-05-04 06:19:15
"Because the vaccine has a low efficacy rate. For herd immunity, 70% would need to get vaccinated if the efficacy rate would be 100%. However, the efficacy rate is about 50% to 90%, there is not enough data yet. So, 100% would need to get vaccinated and even then, herd immunity might not be achievable.",n3hw1f,2021-05-03 15:13:55
Which medical reasons would prevent one from getting vaccinated?,n3hw1f,2021-05-03 00:21:13
">The longer the virus keeps spreading among those who aren't vaccinated...

The virus spreading indefinitely among unvaccinated isn't true. I realize this is a narrative being pushed, but it is contrary to:

1) everything we understand about immunology
2) human evolution and
3) everything we know about prior pandemics and epidemics.

When someone recovers from COVID, they have conferred immunity. How long this lasts we technically do not know yet, but based on that same technicality, we also don't know this for the vaccines. In reality, both the vaccines and natural immunity should prove lasting UNTIL we start to see variants with significant mutations around multiple immune epitopes. Since Sars-Cov-2 mutates at a rate close to Flu (slightly less), this will likely be around 5 years of immunity against the worst of the disease for those who recover. (This has been found to be the immune escape rate for influenza).

My point is - assuming we can reach a SIGNIFICANT portion of the population vaccinated, the UNvaccinated population will not simply get infected over and over again. Those who have recovered are immune, and the point when those individuals need to worry about immune escape is the same point as those who are vaccinated.

The key folks in the equation are those who have NEVER been exposed and are also not vaxxed - but that proportion of folks shrinks every day since every infection pulls from this pool and adds to the immune pool.

Tldr get vaccinated, but also trust our immune systems and evolution to take care of the rest.",n3hw1f,2021-05-03 17:47:33

"> The key folks in the equation are those who have NEVER been exposed and are also not vaxxed - but that proportion of folks shrinks every day since every infection pulls from this pool and adds to the immune pool.

I’m not the person you were responding but it seems to me they aren’t saying it’s going to spread indefinitely amongst the unvaccinated, as in reinfection, but rather they were talking about the group you mentioned - those who are unvaccinated and have never been exposed. I think you’re underestimating, without any concrete proof, that number. 

How many people have never been vaxxed, aren’t planning on getting vaxxed, and also haven’t been exposed at all? Or even the ones who are unable to get it, like children for example? It can spread amongst them and mutate enough to evade immunity. Currently, children make up 22% of Covid cases so it’s already spreading amongst them. The number is something like ~71,000 out of ~314,000. 

There are ~74,000,000 kids in the US. That’s a large group to spread through and mutate. 

Hypothetically, if that were to happen, how long before a new strain, which has the ability to evade immunity, goes undetected? Especially when people think they’re protected because they were vaxxed or already had covid so have natural immunity, and chalk it up to something else other than covid allowing it to spread further, including amongst those with immunity (since it’s a new strain that evades the current immunity).",n3hw1f,2021-05-04 17:04:04

So many people have problems with their heart after COVID vax ...it’s scary,n2yl9o,2021-05-16 14:41:05
"Had my second Pfizer shot on the 12th April. Exactly 4 weeks later I started getting heart flutters/palpitations. They have occurred throughout the day for the last 5 days with no sign of stopping. 

Occurring more regularly maybe in the morning and evening. Im 32 and probably had on average 1-2 heart flutters a year that I can remember. I don’t drink at all and am pretty fit. This seems odd to me.

Of course it could be something else but i’m concerned maybe it is the vaccine, whether it will go away and if there is permanent damage. Me getting anxious about it probably isn’t helping.

Heading to the doctor if its not gone after tomorrow. Will report back if there is any feedback.

UPDATE: For those interested I had an ECG, 24hr holster monitor, heart x-ray and echocardiogram, with an exercise ECG in the coming days. Results are still being sent to my GP and will discuss with then any concerns/advice they have in the next few weeks. 

So far, all I know is it doesn’t seem to be serious. Was told by the nurse doing the echocardiogram that I was having ectopic heart beats, which are usually benign and are rarely a sign of other more serious concerns. The x-ray showed now issues.

After approximately 2 weeks of constant ectopic beats they are now finally gone (frequency deceased over the last two days and finally ended). I had given up coffee two days prior to the seeing GP (usually do two a day) which may have helped and perhaps had just gone through a slightly more stressful time at work which may have contributed. Worrying about the odd heart beats may have also made them worse? The doc/nurses were only mildly interested that I had the pfizer vax.

Personally, I still find it very odd that I’ve never had ectopic beats before and I happen to get a constant 2 weeks of them after having the vax (4 weeks after). Im not convinced they are mutually exclusive events!

Shall update when I get more results/advice.",n2yl9o,2021-05-17 12:35:04

and there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel as a few others have had it go away in time. A combination of Zinc/Calcium/Magnesium supplements and getting in your electrolytes seems to be effective.

"I developed prolonged episodes of heart palpitations (Chaotic heartbeat, fluttering chest; Apple Watch ECG says ""Possible Afib"") about one month after I recovered from a mild but prolonged Covid infection in June 2020.  The episodes would occur 1-2 times a week and last from 2 minutes to 2 hours.  Sometimes I would get a racing heart (120 BPM) with sinus (normal) rhythm.  Sometimes it would be chaotic rhythm at around 80 BPM.  (My normal heart rate is below 60 BPM).  Eventually the palpitations subsided and from December through April I did not have any attacks.

Got my second Pfizer shot on April 5, and 12 days later I began to have palpitation attacks again.  They don't have any identifiable trigger, but laying off caffeine seemed to help.  Haven't had any palpitations since May 8.

Hoping it's just a short-term immunological or inflammatory reaction to the spike protein.  Good luck!",n2yl9o,2021-05-18 21:44:42

 Then, the palpitations has became a daily episode to the point I thought my heart will stop at any point.

"Apart from a weird episode of ectopic beats 3 days ago as I was sitting at a dinner table laughing with some friends, I’ve not felt them after the initial 2 weeks of them being very bad daily. Maybe 1 odd beat here and there. Although I haven’t been doing any physical exercise that would increase my heart beat at the request of the doctor…im a little worried about my next run to be honest.

I would recommend seeing a doctor and not assuming my condition is the same as yours or that it is related to the vax. Better safe than sorry.

That being said, Im pretty damn sure the vax has something to do with it and the more we present ourself to doctors maybe the data will eventually show just that.

I suppose at this point I’m more concerned about the potential long term issues and if getting a booster shot one day will make it happen all over again. But hey, the pros of people getting vaccinated out-way the negatives right?",n2yl9o,2021-05-31 09:18:08

"I have seen a doctor and went to the ER. I’m seeing a cardiologist tmr. They ran all the same tests minus the echocardiogram which I’m doing tomorrow. The doctors and nurses at the ER said the same things that yours said. My personal doctor seemed to admit the vaccine is likely causing this and they’ve been seeing an uptick in these situations. I’m absolutely sure it was the vaccine. I literally don’t even drink coffee and it started out of nowhere

I’d love to know what happens when you begin exercising again. I’m a big cyclists and this is killing me that I’ve had to give that up for now. I’m at the stage where I keep putting thoughts in my head of this never ending. Truly frightened and the reassurances from the doctors and nurses aren’t helping at all since I’m convinced this is vaccine related and none of them know the underlying scientific cause.

"Im seeing my GP end of this week and have an exercise ECG next week. Happy to report back when all is said and done. Your doctors comments were interesting. Would be good to hear any more news you get.

Im not not sure how prone you are to anxiety, I know I am on a fairly low level and overthinking the situation may have exacerbated the issue during those two weeks of bad flutters. Time will tell if its something more serious, but for now I don’t think its reason to be too frightened. We’re still here, happy, not in pain and covid vaccinated. Hopefully back exercising very soon too. Best and most likely scenario is it was a short term, fairly uncomfortable symptom of the vaccine with no lasting implications. 

If after all these test and doctors visits, there is no solid understanding or solution, there is no point worrying because we are not in control. It just is what it is and we have to ride it out. Play our part in what seems to be a bit of a global experiment with these vaccines.",n2yl9o,2021-05-31 12:59:08

"I would appreciate that. I'll let you know if I find out anything noteworthy 

I should have asked if your doctors put you on any meds and if you're still on them? I can't tell if you were trying to say you're on a low level of anxiety meds or you have a low level of anxiety? I think anxiety is absolutely exacerbating the issue. For the first week I was somewhat calm and even did an 80 mile bike ride 4 days after they started (really stupid in hindsight, but I wasn't concerned at the time). Since then I've become more and more anxious and restless which is raising my blood pressure and exacerbating everything. The doctor at the ER tried giving me anxiety meds and I turned them down. I may ask the cardiologist for something tomorrow since focusing on my work is becoming increasingly difficult. My reservation is that I want to know things are improving without meds. I also don't want to become reliant on anything

You're perspective is commendable and I hope to be there soon. I'm currently at the point where I want to march into Pfizer HQ a demand answers that I know I'm not getting. It's not in my nature to just let go and admit I have no control even though that's evident",n2yl9o,2021-05-31 14:28:05

"A vaccine card is not a legal document. Misleading is not the same as forgery.

Your gizmodo article, that itself uses NBCNews as source, which itself again falsely presents what some unnamed FBI dude apparently said, does not matter. Your gizmodo writer isn't a judge. All your other links are irrelevant.

The CDC had the vaccine card template to download on their own website, so that you could print it out yourself. If you print out the ORIGINAL card, which is available, and take it to some vaccination station and make them fill it out after vaccination, would you also consider it forgery? By your logic, it is. You do not have to get it in some shady forum (like the gizmodo article implies). The only thing that can be even remotely considered illegal is that the CDC symbol is on the card and you theoretically don't have their permission to use it (neither does some vaccination station btw., they do not have an explicit written allowance). But if you change a part of it or remove that one (does anyone really check if its there?), you are fine and this isn't the case anymore. Another possible issue is the lying to someone about your vaccination status itself. But lying alone doesn't get you jail-time.

Imagine writing on a paper ""i am vaccinated"". Is this paper now a legal document or medical record? No. Of course not. And printing out the vaccination card without a CDC logo is exactly the same thing.

Lying about forgery shows exactly what kind of person you are.",n29n9r,2021-05-01 09:00:35

"Ehh, I wouldn’t say they’re too “sissy” to say no. The real reason behind forging the cards is that having the card gives you certain benefits. For instance, my university may not allow unvaccinated students to attend in person classes next fall. There’ll probably be a number of other limitations for those who choose to not get vaccinated. So, the reason there is and will be forging of the vaccine cards is that the people want to live to the fullest so to speak. 

Oh btw, they should go straight to jail, on Mars.",n29n9r,2021-05-07 17:14:04

"""  **The unauthorized use of an official government agency’s seal is a crime, and may be punishable under Title 18 United States Code, Section 1017, and other applicable laws, the FBI says.**""

That is why making your own vaccine card using the same template is a crime...

**Title 18 United States Code, Section 1017**

"" **Whoever fraudulently or wrongfully affixes or impresses the seal of any department or agency of the United States, to or upon any certificate, instrument, commission, document, or paper or with knowledge of its fraudulent character, with wrongful or fraudulent intent, uses, buys, procures, sells, or transfers to another any such certificate, instrument, commission, document, or paper, to which or upon which said seal has been so fraudulently affixed or impressed, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.**""

&#x200B;

Untrained eyes would not catch the lack of a CDC logo on a vaccine card. But that would technically not be breaking the law. But it would be a crappy thing to do. People aren't passing out versions of the cards that are from vaccination clinics that use their own template instead of the CDC one. they are passing out the ones with the CDC logo.

&#x200B;

Can you specify how I am ""lying"" about forgery?

I have no beef with you if you aren't making fake vaccine cards or are in possession of one...

My wife had her period 2 days after vax about 17 days early from normal cycle. It was unnerving. It seems to be happening a lot. I’m tired of people calling it “anecdotal” and trying to downplay it as “stress” or whatever. There’s clearly a hormonal side effect in some women. Probably harmless. It’s worth listening to all these women though and studying why it’s becoming a trend.,n1xfpm,2021-05-01 08:04:38
Seems quite common based on people asking about the same question.,n1xfpm,2021-04-30 17:32:11

"They’re downplaying it saying that in clinicals and/or historical research mRNA has no clear path to affecting hormones. Ok? Well now it looks like it probably does in some cases, so someone needs to study this. I hate how many in med are quick to dismiss “anecdotal” evidence as hyperbole while making those who postulate feel like idiots. 

Let’s be clear about this.. it’s a fast moving, widespread, rushed production, and newly advanced method for vaccination. We do not know all of the potential side effects or outcomes. It’s likely harmless to have this side effect, but dismissing it as a symptom of “stress” is bullshit. My wife is stressed 24/7/365 and her cycle has been like clockwork since she was a teenager. Stress didn’t change her menstruation cycle.

It’s a trend. There’s a lot of women having this issue. Again, probably harmless but worth studying and not dismissal by the medical community.",n1xfpm,2021-05-01 18:30:25

My husband got his second Pfizer on Tuesday and came back to work after, worked all day, and then worked Wednesday.  He felt tired and his arm was sore but he was able to power through a 12 hour day of meetings and moving around coordinating workers and stuff.",n1ql6q,2021-04-30 21:52:54
"I was feeling anxious too about the second shot, and I have been having issues with panic due to other health issues lately. So here are some things that helped me, hope it might help you!

If you know of anyone or heard any stories of positive experiences, try to remind yourself of those being real too. I find with my anxiety, the uncertainty of a negative thing makes me focus on it and that makes it worse. So whenever I worried about how the second shot would be, I would tell myself it might not be as bad as I worry about. I reminded myself of people I knew personally who had no effects, and of those who had symptoms only for a day and then were fine. Just try to find a way to counter the anxious thought with another thought. If you don’t know anyone who had no effects then you can take me as an example, after my second Pfizer shot I only had a sore arm (and was very hungry the next day but not sure that’s an actual thing). 

I also took anti anxiety medication before my shot because needles give me extreme anxiety anyways. So if it’s really bad for you, maybe that would help too. If you don’t have medication, bananas can have a natural calming effect, you can try to eat one a half hour before.

I also tried to do things within my control, like making sure to be well hydrated the day before and day of. I went to a state park and spent time in nature the day before, had soothing broth with garlic, and took vitamins. I also reminded myself that feeling anxiety was ok and having that discomfort would not last forever.

You can also let the person giving you the shot know you’re anxious, I read some people can then lie down so they don’t feel faint. If you go with someone and can hold their hand, that helped me too.

Hope you can find something that helps you!",n1ql6q,2021-04-30 22:10:24

These things don't guarantee that you will not be infected with anything neither do they say that you won't be able to trasmit it to others if you do. The best thing is not to take the second dose based on the fact that the survival rate is very high and the original pathogen is on it's way out if around at all.

"My advice, from an extremely anxious person who worked herself into a panic over the possible side effects of the 2nd shot (only sore arm for the first, after anticipating much worse, and possibly an early menstrual cycle), I will tell you exactly what I experienced after the 2nd shot: the shot itself hurt way less (I honestly believe some people are just much better at giving them).  I got it at 1pm on a Tuesday and felt fine the rest of the day/night. I woke up early on Wednesday (I never wake up early) with joint and muscle pain, mainly in my lower body.  Like my hips and knees especially. I had a low-grade fever too. I slept from 1p-7p on Wednesday. I felt better when I woke up, but then my temperature started creeping up again (got up to 101F), and the body aches returned.  I developed chills as well.  I took Advil and went to bed; my fever broke, which was great, but I sweated profusely whole night.  Woke up Thursday, thought I felt better, but then the aches and low-grade fever returned. I started feeling like wtf, will I ever get better??  Thursday night into Friday, I finally felt normal and had no lasting side effects. Bottom line: it's possible you might feel like shit for a day or two, but nothing you can't handle, and then it's over.  There is life on the other side. 😊",n1ql6q,2021-05-05 05:02:30

I guess I’d recommend having a bag in a garbage nearby to help ease your anxiety about getting sick.  I mean, it sucks to puke but at least you won’t feel like you’ll have to jump up and run to the toilet.

I promise you this: if you can handle 24 hours of feeling less-than-stellar, you’ll get to enjoy not having to be anxious about ending up on a ventilator fighting for your life!  You can do this!  I know you can!  It will all be okay.",n1ql6q,2021-05-04 05:37:10

I had very mild symptoms with the first shot besides intense arm brusing/pain. that was basically all, besides feeling a little under the weather for the next day or so. i’m hoping that means i’ll have somewhat manageable symptoms on the second shot, and none that have to do with nausea!",n1ql6q,2021-05-04 05:49:52

I can’t believe no one collected data on women’s menstrual patterns during trials. Like really, that’s not important? I’m sorry I don’t have my links for proof ATM but I do back check literally EVERYTHING I read ( and have great resources most people don’t have. Will not elaborate here. But just trust. Sorry.)  I have found that there is absolutely no data on the first trimester and the vaccine, however anytime after 6 months pregnant most women have been fine. A few personal anecdotes of mine- two co workers ( pregnant women) who took the vaccine were 4 months along and one is overweight and did fine so far, the other is athletic, like my body type and I have not spoken to her for a few weeks now as she has taken time off after her second shot.

In regards to the symptoms you experienced shortly after your immunization: You can’t really prevent vasovagal response if that was what you were experiencing it’s just a nerve response people get sometimes.

Based on your other comments, it looks like you are going to go ahead and get the covid shot. So plan to take a few days off for the first dose, as well as the second dose.

I got moderna 1st dose 3/26 and just got my second dose on 4/23

1st Dose Sides effects:

* Sore Arm for 3 days
* Fatigue
* Headache second day but went away after ibuprofen
* woke up the first couple of mornings hot, but never any fever.

2nd Dose Side Effects:

* Slightly Plugged up nose/ears
* Sore arm for 1 day
* More fatigue (still a bit tired!)
* My head (and back of neck) were very sore, felt like a headache, felt like this several days.
* Headache for 3 days (I have a history of migraines)

It wasn't bad, and much better to have a couple days of feeling a little crappy than 2 weeks of quarantine, worry, and ""covid long haul"". Take it easy, hydrate, have a good book on hand, and take some tylenol if your symptoms are fairly uncomfortable for you.

"You can look up the ingredients. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing in large enough quantities to do anything to you. We ingest these chemicals besides the MRNA in other foods all the time. 

Again- people don’t understand science and latch onto things they think are scary. These are normal- everyday things that we just don’t think about all the time so when it’s injected instead of ingested people freak out. 

People with disabilities aren’t going to have different side effects long term because they can’t. Vaccines do not linger in the system.   

We can guarantee that because we’ve done studies and tests and have decades worth of data that shows there are no long term side effects that show up randomly from vaccines.  All side effects happen quickly. If people with disabilities have a risk- they talk to their doctors about it- but the risk is immediate side effects. Not long term. 

If you’re concerned about people who can’t take the vaccine  because of a disability- it’s another reason to get vaccinated. To help achieve herd immunity for our most vulnerable population.",n0upo3,2021-04-30 14:10:09

"Well I’ll respect your decision for getting the vaccine but I’m not getting it, it hasn’t been out long enough. There isn’t enough research on it and I don’t know how the chemical can react with thousands of other factors. Do you think it should be forced on people?",n0upo3,2021-04-30 14:28:58

You injest those chemicals every day. They aren’t harmful now just because they aren’t in a food. 

Currently no. But if the virus starts to get more deadly or actively starts killing children in masse-then yes.  As long as you don’t have a condition that prevents it.",n0upo3,2021-04-30 15:00:38
Looks like there’s still a chance for side effects,n0upo3,2021-04-30 10:24:56
If the virus changes doesn’t the vaccine do nothing because it’s a new strain? And I’ll be trusting my primary physician who does not agree with receiving the vaccine and already has 14 of his clients be hospitalized by the vaccine for various side effects. And you’re right the religious exception didn’t cut it but a medical note saying there isn’t enough research on vaccine recipients with lactose intolerance and IBS.,n0upo3,2021-04-30 15:19:03
"Yeah- normal everyday side effects you get from other vaccines and medications. You keep talking about long term side effects that “we don’t know about” but no long term side effect has ever shown up more than six months after taking a vaccine -which is how much time data we have. 

You’re just being willfully ignorant now and refusing to understand basic information.",n0upo3,2021-04-30 13:45:29
"One person should not trump the entire medical community.  That’s my point. You are letting one person -One person- risk your health and safety. 

Doctors are not infallible. But when the vast majority of doctors, immunologists and virologists say something is safe, you should believe them.    You believe the entire medical community when it’s AGs things like don’t drink arsenic and cancer needs to be treated with radiation. You would think someone is a crackpot if they said cancer can be healed with essential oils or coffee. This is the same thing.

And no. The vaccine does not become completely ineffective with a new strain. We’ve already done studies on multiple new strains and the vaccine may become slightly less effective (90% instead of 95%) but it is still extremely effective against death, hospitalization, and long term side effects from Covid. 

We have data showing that Covid has -horrible- long term side effects such as brain fog, damaged kidneys, lungs, lack of energy, taste and smell loss, and you have an 11% of getting those long term side effects. Meanwhile, we have decades of data proving vaccines don’t cause long term side effects.   You are more at risk without getting the vaccine- not to mention you risk your life. 

A 40 year old at my work just died a few weeks ago from covid. Others have brain fog. Another is on oxygen and can barely walk. These are real. These are happening. The vaccine long term side effects aren’t real. They are just people who don’t understand science being scared.",n0upo3,2021-04-30 15:51:40
"Also- primary doctors office not have specialties in vaccines or epidemiology. You are basically trusting someone who has a math degree to tell you how to build a a skyscraper. Both use math, but one is infinitely more complex.",n0upo3,2021-04-30 15:56:10

unfortunately theres not much known yet about how long the protection lasts. it takes up to 14 days after the 2nd dose for full efficacy. this is for both brands. But just like anything everyone is different. The ingredients are listed on each brands respective website so you can check if there are any allergy contradictions. I would recommend getting it if you can!,lq762a,2021-02-24 00:26:12

"Yes, and constant pressure in the head with tinnitus. It sucks, nothing relieves it.",lkutwp,2021-04-24 23:45:03
"Honestly sounds like anxiety & a vasovagul reaction from the needle. I always get like that after a shot or blood work bc I have a severe phobia. Sounds exactly like what happens to me. I usually stay seated after or lay down, drink a lot of water, and wait until I feel okay! It always passes in 15 mins or less.",lkhq3c,2021-02-15 17:12:41
"Totally not a doctor or health professional of any kind, but it sounds like vasovagal syncope.  I've gotten it a couple of times in my life (having blood taken (just a vial), trying to donate blood as a teenager, and probably tmi, but using a menstrual cup for the first time).

I think it's considered more psychological (a stress response) than anything purely physically wrong with you or caused directly by the vaccine.

It's a very weird sensation since it just goes away after a few minutes.  Like you feel like your dying and then, just, all better. 😁😟",lkhq3c,2021-02-15 17:17:17
"Not a medical professional, but will absolutely concur with those who are saying it sounds like vasovagal response. This happens to me when I get blood drawn or an IV put in and has since I was about 14. A few times they’ve had to use smelling salts on me. I also have several phobias that induce panic responses very much like what you described here. 

For your next dose, ask if you can be injected laying down or reclining. This helps me immensely when possible. When I get vaccinations and blood draws they usually put me in another room with an examination table I can lay on, instead of sitting up in a chair. If the vaccine is a drive thru clinic and you are in your car, bring someone else to drive you and recline the passenger seat if you can. If this isn’t possible, still make sure that you tell them about what happened last time and let them know you are a fainter. They will take proper precautions with you, because this thing is actually really common, and they are ready for these situations. 

Don’t look at the needle going in, and for me personally, it helps if they *don’t* warn me before it goes in by saying things like “you’re going to feel a little pinch,” “here it comes,” or “it’s about to go in.” The anticipation of needle makes it worse. It sounds like the person administering the vaccine talked to you about possible side effects right before it went in - and that can certainly make someone anxious if they are afraid of needles already. 

I honestly do better when they just talk about other things while prepping my skin, like their dogs or their kids, and surprise me with the needle. Like, I don’t faint when I get an unexpected paper cut or a bug bite so I react the same way when they just quietly jab me and get done with it. And honestly, many vaccinations, especially the Moderna vaccine, use such small needles you probably won’t feel it much. I didn’t feel mine at all until a few hours later.

For vaccines and blood draws, they keep me around for about 15 mins afterward since I’m a fainter (which they would do for you anyway since everyone has to wait around after the COVID bad) and sometimes offer me crackers or juice. It may help to bring some crackers and maybe a soft drink or juice box to sip on afterward. Make sure you are hydrated before you go. Bring something to preoccupy your mind while you are waiting for the next dose, and after. 

Best wishes!",lkhq3c,2021-02-15 18:01:26
100% an anxious reaction. I felt the same.,lkhq3c,2021-02-15 18:37:50
"Agree. Possibly anxiety. I was the same way with one of my shots. This time, I was prepared. Kept thinking to myself to remain calm. And if something did happen, there’s personnel there to assist me of something went wrong.",lkhq3c,2021-02-15 18:53:16
"Yep, this sounds like a vasovagal response! I’ve had them many times before while getting IV infusions. It feels like you’re going to die while it’s happening and it’s a little embarrassing and dramatic, but you feel better almost right away. It’s common, and harmless as long as you don’t injure yourself falling. I concur with the other folks here recommending telling your doctor or nurse that you’re feeling anxious before hand and requesting to lie down. Other things that have helped me: eating a medium-sized salty meal beforehand to make your stomach feel full and settled and to keep your blood pressure regulated, making sure you’re well-hydrated, and trying to avoid getting shots when you’re feeling really tired early in the morning. And don’t look at the needle, whatever you do! Best of luck with the second dose.",lkhq3c,2021-02-16 04:11:24

"Wow, I’ve never heard of that! This was the first time I’ve really felt all of those symptoms around a needle.

Probably just too overwhelmed about everything. Thanks for your insight!",lkhq3c,2021-02-15 19:25:43

I’ll have to see if they can make an accommodation for that. The place I got my dose at was basically a convention center with tons of people and tables just jabbing everyone they could.

"Thank  you for being the guinea pig to test a vaccine for us that has had zero  studies about long-term effects, zero studies about its effects on  fertility and pregnancies, zero studies about if it even provides any  protection for longer than two months and that did bypass those usually  required studies with emergency admissions.

To answer your question, here are the immediate effects that you can expect:

Pfizer: [https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)

Moderna: [https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download)

In  the Pfizer document, the immediate adverse events are in the table  starting at page 35. With ""Severe"" meaning that you aren't able to do  daily activities (aka go to work) when marked with (a) and requires at  least intravenous hydration when marked with (b).

So  with the first dose you will have about a 2 to 3% chance of having  severe reaction and a 27% chance that you experience pain that requires  you to take pain medication. The second dose is much more brutal with 5  to 10% for sever reactions and 45% requiring pain medication.

It  has a 10 to 20 times higher rate of adverse events than established  vaccinations that did go through the required studies, like the Tetanus  or Hepatitis vaccine. And as mentioned, long-term effects are totally  unknown and the people who get the vaccine now are the test subjects.",lhwx1q,2021-02-12 16:37:22

I agree to the tested and known to work vaccines like the Tetanus vaccine. I do not agree with an experimental untested vaccine that works on a totally different basis and went through ZERO long term studies and that already shows a 10 to 20 times higher rate of adverse events than any established vaccine.

I do think that people who want to get this experimental vaccine should KNOW what they are up to. It is their right to KNOW that they inject something into their body that is untested (for long-term effects). They can not make an informed decision if they do not know.

"They give evidence showing the effectiveness of Hydrochloroquin in treating covid-19 patients along with other items, including legal sources as well. They also urged caution for extended mask wear and if it's legal to mandate masks. They also urge caution on the vaccine and speak out against the current cancel culture that's appearing for anyone who urges caution. Were you aware that Dr. Fauci wrote several papers on the Spanish Flu and in his papers he cited more then once that the main cause of death during that time wasn't actually Spanish Flu but was a bacterial pneumonia caused by wearing masks? But now suddenly we need to wear more then 1 mask to keep ourselves from getting Covid. Regular masks are about as effective as an open doorway used to keep someone out, due to how small the virus is versus the size of the holes in the masks.

Or were you aware that the protein the vaccine is teaching our bodies to attack is the exact same protein that's needed to be able to create the placenta in a pregnant woman? Tell me, what is the possible side effect of teaching our bodies to attack that which it needs to create life?

What goes through the head of the people who do downvote that? That it has to be shut down because the reality makes Big Pharma look bad?

Gene therapy edits the original genetic information each cell carries, i.e. to fix defective cancer cells.

If you're only wearing it 20 minutes a day, then you need to wear it more according to your view point and stance.

Urging caution isn't fear mongering, it's urging caution. Stop trying to mislable.

If I recall the protein is syncitin that the vaccine is teaching our bodies to attack, which is needed for the placenta.

Everything that i get from you guys are ridiculous statements and claims like saying that Pfizer themselves are anti-vaxxers or that VAERS doesn't exist. And whever some case comes up with severe adverse effects, you downvote it and want to shut it down.

I am tired of your shit. Go and take the vaccine! Go and take the vaccine that has ZERO studies about long term effects. The vaccine that has 10 to 20 times more adverse events than any other common vaccine in the first two months (the only period that we got studies). The vaccine that has ZERO studies about its effects on special interest groups. The vaccine that has ZERO studies about its effects on fertility. The vaccine that has ZERO studies about if it even offers any protection past two months.

An article talking about the paper being retracted (with added bonuses in the comments pointing out how *strange* it is that the authors of the study you cited didn't verify the research they're writing about)

For the covid vaccines:  
What? I pulled a direct quote from the page you listed, but okay. Here's a longer excerpt:

>The frequency of serious adverse events was low (<0.5%), without meaningful imbalances between study arms. Among non-serious unsolicited adverse events, there was a numerical imbalance of four cases of Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group compared with no cases in the placebo group, though the four cases in the vaccine group do not represent a frequency above that expected in the general population. Otherwise, there were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to BNT162b2 vaccine. With the exception of more frequent,  generally mild to moderate reactogenicity in participants <55 years of age, the safety profile of BNT162b2 was generally similar across age groups, genders, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without medical comorbidities, and participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment. 

Should more studies be done? Of course, and they literally *are* being done. Again, I stand by the point I left bolded unless you can show me any evidence to the contrary: There's literally zero direct evidence that the covid vaccine frequently causes any severe adverse effects, and it's sure as hell safer than covid, itself.

"hey! I am in the same boat as you — I received the first Moderna shot after I had COVID in October. The morning after the shot was horrible... I couldn’t move, felt sick, and almost had my roommate drive me to the ER. 

I got the 2nd shot yesterday morning, and I woke up 30 minutes ago feeling 10x better than the first shot. Just a sore arm and low grade fever this time around. i’ll keep you updated if it gets worse!

my opinion: you’re lucky enough to be able to get the vaccine, so get the 2nd one! I promise you the worst of it is over with.",lfeiv6,2021-02-09 13:34:14
Thank you so much for your help! Can you explain to me what a secondary immune response is/means? Is this bad? Should I be worried? Too late! I already am. Lol,lfeiv6,2021-02-08 19:36:26
Moderna,lfeiv6,2021-02-08 22:14:25
Ok thanks and good luck with the shot!!!,lfeiv6,2021-02-09 00:31:17
Thank you for sharing your experience! I am sorry you felt awful from it as well. Did you have the antibodies before you got the first shot? The sickness from the shot is horrible! Makes me feel like I have the virus all over again. Keep me posted on how you are feeling! Thanks!,lfeiv6,2021-02-09 13:47:03
"The vaccine created proteins that your immune system attacks and creates anti-bodies for. If you already have antibodies, they will attack the proteins produced by the vaccine in force, which will make you feel sick. It is your immune system doing what it is supposed to do, and it is normal. If you had no anti-bodies, your reaction would, likely, be significantly less.",lfeiv6,2021-02-08 21:10:57
"Hi! So I got my second dose on Friday around 2:30pm. That day my arm hurt really really bad. Saturday my arm still hurt terribly and I have a horrible migraine headache (the same headache I had when I actually had covid), ibuprofen kinda helped with both. I also slept a lot all day and just kinda lounged around. Sunday just my arm hurts but it’s definitely getting better. 

My second dose was a lot better than my first 🙏🏻",lfeiv6,2021-02-14 13:17:16
"Yep! I tested positive for the antibodies before. I’m also 18 years ago... the group that has the strongest reaction are younger people with the antibodies so I had horrible luck haha. I just took some advil this morning, also make sure you drink lots of water as you will get dehydrated from sweating.",lfeiv6,2021-02-09 13:48:50
"Oh I see. Thank you so much for explaining this to me! I wanted to ask you something. I thought the whole point behind having the antibodies after getting the virus was that IF your body was exposed to it again, it would recognize it, and attack it. But you probably wouldn’t even know or show symptoms of being sick. I thought that if you had the antibodies you would be protected from the virus even getting far enough to cause your immune system to create symptoms for you to feel sick. Maybe I am not understanding this, I really don’t think I am. I am so sorry!",lfeiv6,2021-02-08 21:51:56
Glad to hear that you are on the mend! I am not going to get the second shot. I was so sick from this first one. Plus I already had the antibodies so I think I am good now :),lfeiv6,2021-02-14 18:25:37
Yeah totally feel dehydrated! Soooo thirsty! I dunno if we really need the second shot. What do you think?,lfeiv6,2021-02-09 14:04:57
"An immune response will give you some symptoms of illness... When you get sick, normally some of your symptoms are caused by the immune response instead of the actual disease.

When the virus comes into your body, it will multiply.... this is why it is so dangerous. The vaccine will not do that. 

I don't think you will have a secondary immune response after normal exposure to COVID after you have been vaccinates (I am not sure)... but you have to remember, with the vaccine, the target proteins are in your body in fairly large numbers at once. There is a lot for your immune system to target.",lfeiv6,2021-02-09 00:17:52
"I felt like I need the second shot because there’s history with the antibodies disappearing after 3 months or so  — my sister got COVID twice. So if I want 98% immunity after the 3 months from October, I felt I needed the second shot.",lfeiv6,2021-02-09 14:07:34
"So what do you suppose might happen if you were exposed to the virus with just the normal antibodies that occur naturally after an initial infection? Would you get/feel sick? This is of course, before getting the vaccination.",lfeiv6,2021-02-09 00:33:19
Omg she got it twice? Geez. Poor thing I hope she is ok! I have the antibodies still since March. I think how long you have them for is dependent on how severe of an infection it was. At least that’s what I’ve read. I could be wrong!,lfeiv6,2021-02-09 14:19:51
"I am not sure, but I doubt you would notice at all.... The same after getting the vaccine.",lfeiv6,2021-02-09 02:31:03
Soooo weird...then why would I get sick from the shot?,lfeiv6,2021-02-09 02:43:52
because the shot causes a large quantity of the proteins that the anti-bodies attack to be inside of you. It mimics a full blown infection.... Much more than casual exposure.,lfeiv6,2021-02-09 03:42:57
I see..ok! Thank you so much for explaining this to me.,lfeiv6,2021-02-09 03:58:22
"I got the same reaction as you for my second moderna shot.  Had chills, headache, debilitating body aches, and fever.  I still have a fever at the moment and some body aches, it’s not as bad as it was last night.  Hopefully I’ll wake up normal tomorrow.",leqngj,2021-02-08 01:23:36

My 70-year-old sister had covid about 4 months ago. She got her first Pfizer shot on Friday. By Saturday morning she was flat on her back and feeling awful. She noticed a significant improvement around noon on Sunday and by Sunday night although she still had some symptoms she knew she was out of the woods. So sorry to hear this and I do wonder what the second shot brings. Be well.,leqngj,2021-02-07 19:32:17
Wow what flustercuck,leqngj,2021-02-08 16:43:32
How many days ago did you get the shot? It is coming up on 48 hours and I still feel sick. Low grade fever (99).,leqngj,2021-02-08 14:28:13
Thanks! The problem is that I did have the virus and I hope this is considered a normal reaction to the shot,leqngj,2021-02-07 17:47:42
Thank you for your help! I am definitely not getting the second shot after this.,leqngj,2021-02-07 19:45:25
"I got it on 2/6 at 930am.  I woke up today and I feel normal now.  Felt symptoms on 900pm on 2/6 and felt sick for about 24 hours. 

I heard of people feeling sick for 48 hours.  I’m sure you’re going to feel normal very soon.",leqngj,2021-02-08 15:31:08
"My doc ,65M, had covid back in March. Got first moderna shot in Jan and had extreme lethargy, slight chills then was better very quickly. Second shot he had no issues.",leqngj,2021-02-07 18:26:11
"I've actually heard the first shot is worse for people who have had covid already than for people who haven't. As for the second shot it's usually not bad for people who've had covid and worse for people who haven't gotten it so I would say your reaction may be in line but I would still call your doctor again.

For reference I've never had covid and I got my first shot 2 days ago and my only symptom was a slightly achy arm (that happens every time I get a shot) and maybe a mild headache (that also happens fairly often so I'm not sure if it was related to the shot).",leqngj,2021-02-07 23:43:28
"This whole thing sucks, on so many levels.",leqngj,2021-02-07 19:46:56
I hope so! Did you have the virus beforehand?,leqngj,2021-02-08 15:46:19
Nope,leqngj,2021-02-08 16:52:47
Is there a reason why you would have more covid symptoms if you already have antibodies in your system? Shouldn't you have less symptoms if you already have antibodies?,le9qkj,2021-02-06 23:38:58
This makes me feel a ton better! My mom just had her first moderna shot and is experiencing all those symptoms. She's actually quite uncomfortable.  We think she may have had Covid a couple of months ago but she tested negative for both Covid and the flu but it was pretty serious and rough for just a cold. I tried to ask this on another sub and got banned for spreading conspiracy. Smh. I like conspiracies sometimes but not about this or when it comes to my family. Thanks again for sharing this. You've helped me to feel.much better,le9qkj,2021-02-07 00:51:39
This happened to me too. I tested positive for antibodies Jan 5th and got my first Moderna shot on the 6th. I’ll be getting my second Moderna shot in a few hours. Do you think I will have the same Covid like symptoms again? I got really sick.,le9qkj,2021-02-07 11:27:43
"My 70 year old sister had the same experience with her first Pfizer shot, she had covid several months ago. I know a number of people who got the first shot (both brands) and experienced only a sore arm, including myself. So I am expecting flu-ish symptoms with #2, but i am wondering what she will experience with her #2. Will she have a similar reaction as the first shot or something else?",le9qkj,2021-02-07 11:39:00
My understanding is the vaccine has a protein that mimicked the virus so your body is trying to fight against it causing the same symptoms as Covid,le9qkj,2021-02-06 23:40:48
"The standard protocol now is 2 shots for everyone. If you had a strong immune reaction to the first shot you are likely to have at least the same strength of reaction to the second. 

That being said, there are some scientists on Twitter and in the press now openly questioning the need for a second shot in people who have tested positive for COVID before receiving the first shot. I have yet to see any of them say not to get it but rather they would like to see a study done to see if it does anything to increase immunity.",le9qkj,2021-02-07 16:26:06
Just from hearing about people’s experiences you might get symptoms again. A lot of people aren’t experiencing the symptoms until they get their second vaccine,le9qkj,2021-02-07 12:04:12
I have been seeing a lot of people who don’t develop their symptoms until after the second vaccine. So I would think she may have symptoms again.,le9qkj,2021-02-07 12:05:49
"I thought the vaccine caused your body to produce antibodies, which could fight a future Covid infection.

This is the first time I've heard that it mimicked the virus. If true, why aren't millions getting sick?",le9qkj,2021-02-07 00:12:05
"That’s interesting, I need to look that up. I had Covid back in June",le9qkj,2021-02-07 21:57:55
"I'm thinking you're right, which sucks. She struggles with life as it is, but it is better than getting re-infected.",le9qkj,2021-02-07 12:10:59
It does. A typical vaccine like a flu shot just uses a dead form of the virus to stimulate antibody production. The Moderna Covid vaccine teaches your cells to make a protein similar to what Covid looks like which stimulates an immune system response therefore creating antibodies. If your body already has the antibodies then it generates an immune response within 24 hours of the injection. Some people reacted differently to the virus with some only having mild symptoms while others became really sick. So I am assuming my body is reacting to the vaccine the same way it reacted to the virus.,le9qkj,2021-02-07 00:19:01
It is unfortunate because I know a lot of people have a hard time tolerating the symptoms. It’s been almost 48 hours since my first vaccine and I’m already starting to feel better so hopefully the symptoms don’t last very long. Best of luck!,le9qkj,2021-02-07 12:12:24
Thank you and thank you for putting yourself at risk to help others!,le9qkj,2021-02-07 12:14:43
"Got mine two weeks ago today and I too only experienced a sore arm for about 36 hrs. I've talked to many folks of all ages who got both brands of vaccines and it seems the sore arm is pretty much what the experience is for #1. Of those who also got #2, experienced the sore arm as well along with flu-ish type symptoms. Good luck to all vaxers everywhere.",lcacns,2021-02-04 11:11:44
"I’m a 26F and just got my 1st dose about 3 hours ago. Started off okay but now have some good soreness and aching settling into my left upper arm and shoulder. I cant lift my arm up, like to reach something out of a cabinet without the pain and soreness. Also feeling a tad fatigued and nauseous but could just be from the nerves, other underlying medical conditions I have, or the fact it’s almost time to get off work from a week of hell lol.",lcacns,2021-02-05 21:21:05
nothing but a sore arm. getting my second tomorrow 👍👍,lcacns,2021-02-04 09:16:38

"I don’t feel like the way someone dies should be demeaned by the other ways they could die. Preventable loss of life is tragic. If you’re not a denier, than you’re just an ass by feeling the need to drive that point into the ground.

Lol I don’t know how else you want me to say that I am a super sensitive baby and that I’ve had a long and complex history finding medications to treat my illnesses because the cure is often just as bad. Would rather be transparent that I am often an exception to the rule rather than scare people thinking they’re definitely going to react as badly as I have.

Definitely have your grandma keep drinking water and juice. The sugar in orange juice gave me energy without making me nauseous.

I developed fairly severe tinnitus due to an ototoxic medication several years ago. Learned to live with it, (mostly), but the week after the first shot was murder. Can’t say I’m looking forward to the second one... 

There is some evidence of a Covid-19 infection making tinnitus worse, but I haven’t seen anything about this effect from the vaccine. Might just be due to systemic inflammation.

I got the moderna one....that’s interesting but I haven’t had any suicidal thoughts since getting it. But weird vivid dreams and intense dissociation and panic/anxiety.,kxm587,2021-01-15 15:55:15
Yes all my emotions have been heightened ever since I got the vaccine 7 days ago.....I’m sorry about the pain in your foot.....I still think I did the right thing getting vaccine so we can get to the goal of 80% of the population being vaccinated....I was expecting physical side effects but not mental,kxm587,2021-01-15 16:57:50

"I had the exact thing happen to me. I received the Pfizer one. I was a bit nervous on the way there but nothing out of the ordinary—maybe a bit tired and stressed. I do have a history of panic attacks and anxiety but have learned how to calm myself down very well. 
After waiting 15 mins at the site, we left as told since I felt fine (thankfully I wasn’t driving), and I was mid-sentence talking about my day when I felt the panic unload on me like a ton of bricks. My partner was rightfully concerned, but since it felt so much like a panic attack I didn’t think it was a reaction. I was suspicious, but didn’t want to get in my head any more than I was already, so I just used my calming tools and reassured myself that I was tired. Thankfully I calmed down relatively quickly, but I still feel like it could creep back at any time. Its been a few hours, and I definitely don’t feel great. I don’t feel quite dizzy, more woozy I guess? But I feel very out of it as well, as if I’m going through constant panic just at a lesser level. I have experienced dissociation in the past as well, and it feels very similar. 
You all are certainly not alone. What you have described is exactly what I’m going through now. And it sucks, but I’m thankful that we did. Please don’t be afraid to reach out!

I threw up 3 times in a row the 2 morning. Other than that I've been fine.

I work in a nursing home as a housekeeper. Before I got positive there were 3 people before me who got it and one after me that I know of. All different jobs.

We are scheduled for the next dose the 20 of this month. All the people who I asked that got it felt fine.",kwyj86,2021-01-14 17:15:19

The first is a cough from hell it seems. That's stated it all is is here still. That night I had the runs and a slight fever that lasted till the morning. The 2 day I threw up 3 times in a row. And a slight loss of taste. I still could but it was dolled.

But after day 2 I feel fine. Just coughing.",kwyj86,2021-01-14 17:24:17

"Thank you. I was pissed when I found out I got it after the first vaccine. I know they all have reason to not want to ware a mask. But they should. I dont know if the work or not. And are compling about an slight inconvenience for how ever long they are near people. But it's not like they are being asked to were n95 or other. Just to get food or anything. They get bracks. Car home. But on my nursing home. There are residents that have oxygen that were a mask when they leve there room. Some when people come on there room. When they aren't falling well and want to protect the workers. 
Can you imagine wearing a mask were you live just so you try to protect the people caring for you? Only person in the room but knows about what time we get there and puts a mask on just for us. So we dont get sick. People who get to leave go home. See people in stores and we have more than them. But we are bringing it to them. And they still try and protect the workers. It is so sweet and hart breaking at the same time.

So I dont like the anti-maskers much for that reason. As we as many others. They complain and dont do it. What about the people trying to take care of someone who needs it? It can be anyone. We dont know what anyone is going through and yet they are making promises for everyone. My aunt complains but she where's one. She knows she ant got it as bad as people wearing then for hours till they can get them off.",kwyj86,2021-01-15 18:44:06

"""Based on how mRNA vaccines work, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant. However, the actual risks of mRNA vaccines to the pregnant person and her fetus are unknown because these vaccines have not been studied in pregnant women."" Thats from the CDC's website.

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html)

&#x200B;

The thing is, to say based on how mRNA vaccines work, we don't think its likely to cause a problem, is a weird statement. You could make a mRNA vaccine that teaches the immune system to attack any protein in the body. So they could make one that would do that.

What they mean to say is ""We don't think THIS mRNA vaccine works that way."" However the protein it teaches the immune system to attack, is important for the fetus binding in the uterus. Its what makes the bond there, and could for example increase ectopic pregnancies or all kinds of things. The warning from these ""trolls"" like myself who are taking our personal time while being formally attacked for going against what people want to hear, is that  WE DONT KNOW FOR SURE AND IT IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE ITS NOT BEEN TESTED. The reason it is dangerous is because the same protein exists there that the immune system is taught to attack and it has NOT been studied.

&#x200B;

The risks of dying of covid as a young person are extremely low at <0.005%. The risks of the vaccine causing problems in pregnancy? Unknown. Which looks safer to you... 0.005% or a dice roll?

Feel however you want about it, but sincerely the CDC formally states they do not know, so for you to say "" infErtiLitY"" when someone brings up some science with you and that you are sure their hypothesis isnt true, which the CDC doesn't even know admittedly, it's a little bit weird on your part.

Im not here for my benefit and Im not trying to control anyone or prevent from doing what they want. I am just concerned about young people diving in when they don't understand what the risks are. I hope you're right, I guess we will find out over the next few years.",kvlxwy,2021-01-12 16:08:53

"Viruses, medications, and vaccines totally can impact your menstrual cycle! They can cause physical stress on your body or change the balance of hormones. As you correctly understand, stress can impact your cycle. :)

I was simply asking if others had that experience. And it looks like one or two have. 

Impacting menstrual cycle is an entirely different discussion from impacting your long term fertility. I’m sure this is an important issue to you, but it’s very clearly not what I’m talking about. 

No big deal - just better to not conflate two totally different issues. That’s the type of thing that confuses people!",kvlxwy,2021-01-12 18:17:49

"Update, so I had an MRI without contrast and I didn't show any abnormalities. I also had a heart CT with contrast for the dizziness symptom, also unremarkable. My symptoms aren't progressing but they aren't getting any better. I still have uncontrollable twitching in my hands shoulders hips and knees areas. I still have reduced fine motor control in my hands along with unsteady shaking. I still have a sense of weakness in both my arms and my legs as well as random bouts of dizziness. I have a neurology appointment coming up in a few days so I'm expecting more testing. I can live like this as the longest it doesn't progress and I think it's not going to. Correlation does not mean causation but it's a pretty strong case in my book. My best guess as to what has happened has been that the MRNA created too intense of a reaction in my immune system and as the vaccine causes your own cells to make the spike protein and thus the immune system to recognize that spike protein in the cells and then destroy them, I believe somehow it involved my nervous system inadvertently and that my immune system attacked my nervous system thus leading to neurological problems. I'm certainly not shying away from ever getting a covid vaccine again, because I think it's very important, but I'll be waiting for a vaccine that takes a more traditional approach such as an inactivated or attenuated virus to get vaccinated again.",ktwftm,2021-02-07 14:48:34

This makes sense, but luckily it hasn't progressed to the level some have that because honestly that's terrifying.

No other symptoms as of now, today. I'm still debating on whether or not I want to get the second dose. I think I might just be ready to go to the hospital for a possible anaphylactic reaction, especially if it increases in severity as most people with their second shot do. I think I might try following a super antihistamine diet two weeks before to see if that can help lessen the reaction. If I am reacting to PEG, waiting for another vaccine like the one dose Johnson & Johnson won't really do any good because they have polysorbate in theirs and those two chemicals are very closely related, so if I have a reaction to one I'll probably have a reaction to the other.",ktwftm,2021-01-10 19:47:37

"So yesterday early morning my arm started to get a small warm patch of redness on my right arm, where I got the vaccine, and I started to itch all over again. It's has now grown by 2 to 3 times it's original size this morning and my armpit and chest is in a lot of pain. It hurts to breathe in on that side, like a really really severely pulled muscle. Unfortunately I can't take nsaids because I'm allergic to them :(",ktwftm,2021-01-18 12:37:48
So my armpit no longer hurts but the spot continues to expand and is starting to wrap around to the inside of my arm and is itchy. Size wise it's about a 5x3 inch area of my arm. Asked the doc and she says it's a common but not communicated symptom to the public after the vaccine administration and to ice and put OTC cortisone in it.,ktwftm,2021-01-19 23:39:35
"Okay , I've developed new symptoms. Intense dizziness, feeling like I've got a build up of electricity in my brain, almost like I'm being shocked and now I've now begun to have muscle twitching. It's progressed over the past three days so become more constant and intense. My hands will now twitch close, my legs will jerk and my arms will move. It was really bad last night as I was trying to lay down and go to sleep and my body kept moving every 30 seconds or so. I'm actually starting to get scared at this point and have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, though it's unlikely they'll do anything. I don't know what to do but if this doesn't resolve in the next week I will not get the 2nd dose. I will wait for the safe, tested tech that's coming out in a few months. Hopefully I will have enough protection to last until then.",ktwftm,2021-01-21 13:03:10

Did a brain CT, simple blood work, and told it's a severe hypersensitive reaction, follow up with my MD and good luck. I am now scheduled with a neurologist early next month and will be having a brain MRI as well. My large inflamed global reaction on my arm has visually disappeared but it itches multiple times a day in the same area, even more so when it was red and angry looking.  This is honestly life changing as my hands are no longer steady and I need it for my work. I really, really need this to not progress any worse. I'm scared, it sucks.",ktwftm,2021-01-28 03:07:21

"Hi I just read your posts. I have been having a very stressful experience also. I developed numbness in my arms and leg along with tingling, earache and dizziness. It lasted 4 weeks.  I had many tests including an mri which came back normal. I had an emg also waiting on the results of that.  I think in my case this is all caused by some sort of inflammation. Good news is that in the past few days I'm starting to feel better. Thats approx 4 weeks after the first dose. Its been horrible and pretty upsetting since I really wanted this vaccine and still do. I decided against the second dose and am hoping to wait a while and try a different vaccine, not mrna. I dont know if  its the peg or if its just im sensitive to whatever the mechanism is in this one. So I hope you start to feel better too? How long has it been since your first dose?",ktwftm,2021-02-10 20:22:51
Interesting have you tried the floxies group on Reddit . Sounds like floxing . I had similiar reactions like that but with an antibiotic. You might have genetic disposition like us floxies do . It takes your body time to heal . I had twitching on my eyelids after vaccine which was my first symptom after being floxed a year ago . I’m having neuropathy issues too again like when I was floxed,ktwftm,2021-03-16 07:00:03
Good to know.  I am day 1 post moderna dose 1. I have arm soreness and I feel tired. But I also don’t know if because I had a very busy last week. I still did my grocery shopping today but needed a nap afterwards.,ktwftm,2021-01-10 21:36:19
Which vaccine did you get?,ktwftm,2021-01-10 18:15:59
Do you think you will get the second dose?,ktwftm,2021-01-09 20:11:19
In think its pretty normal if you scroll through this site. Everyone is different but its definitely anxiety producing. My face just got hot and I had a full on sweating few moments.  Its gone now. Yes sad to say the arm will get more painful. Try some ice packs.,ktwftm,2021-01-09 20:14:24
"That sounds like anxiety to me. I've seen the exact same thing many times over. Call your doctor if you're concerned, but I bet it's just your anxiousness getting the better of you. You should probably avoid Reddit and read some books you enjoy/watch some movies, there's a lot of anti-vaxxers on here spreading trash right now.",ktwftm,2021-01-11 01:11:11
My friend had the same symptoms and he was rushed to the hospital for brain swelling.  I pray for you!,ktwftm,2021-01-10 17:10:27
"That sounds like a relatively normal (if not heightened) reaction to a vaccine to me. Flu-like symptoms are completely normal and mentioned in the literature on these vaccines. Anaphylaxis is a very different thing. Just make sure to stick around the doctor's office for 30 minutes after your 2nd dose if you're worried about it, but it seems like you may be overthinking things. I get the same reaction to flu shots, for what it's worth, and COVID shots are supposed to elicit and even stronger immune response.",ktwftm,2021-01-11 01:13:48

"I’m lucky because my physician has always been transparent and has shown sound judgement so when he and I discussed it, I had a sense that my risks for complications from COVID (I’m also high risk) were much higher than complications from a vaccine. But, I hugged my kids really hard before I left for the morning!",kth3yv,2021-01-09 11:14:31
"I was in surgery, so I don’t remember much, but my blood pressure bottomed out and I remember that I couldn’t pee because my whole body was swollen. I was given three intravenous doses of epinephrine, which my doctor tells me was quite a bit.

And I was called a crazed conspiracy theorist for saying this would happen...,ktaj7b,2021-01-14 17:35:00
"Hey how are you feeling now? I had pretty much the same reaction. Super sweaty, super tingly, super dizzy, super anxious, etc. I was also really nervous about passing out. Fortunately, the side-effects just instantly stopped after about two minutes. I chalked it up to anxiety considering I do not have any known allergies to medicine, but at the same time, I still do not know what happened. Then, for about a week or so, I experienced random bouts of dizziness and headaches, but that may have been anxiety again.

I saw someone talk about Vasovagal Syncope in your other post and I thought that was really interesting. I could believe it considering I was pretty nervous and stressed out.",ktaj7b,2021-01-25 17:24:19

Great getting mine on the 5th of January love these updates,kn71ew,2020-12-30 19:00:21
I had the Moderna last Monday and only reaction I had was a moderate headache that was mostly gone by the next day. Sorry to hear you didn’t have the same experience. Hope you get well soon.,kn71ew,2020-12-30 20:40:25
"Yes, my mom experienced  headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and body aches hours after the Moderna vaccine. Her injection site was red and swollen.  After a full day of vomiting, she felt better and is only left with a swollen injection site.",kn71ew,2020-12-30 22:22:32
"You should be able to get the second, you had a mild reaction that wasn’t life threatening. Sounds like hives",kn71ew,2020-12-31 01:48:59

"I got mine today at 8:49am. It's 7:51pm as I'm typing this and all I feel is soreness on my arm, nothing worse than after getting a flu shot though. I also didn't even feel the injection. That feeling of soreness gradually increased all day. I took acetaminophen 1000mg before i got the shot and I didn't take pain pills anymore after my vaccination. Hopefully the second dose will be the same.",kn71ew,2020-12-31 03:54:26

"I had terrible pain at injection site and couldn’t move my arm. I then developed HA, chills, body aches and spiked a 103 fever. I’m doing better now but very fatigued. If it makes you feel better I imagine you might have had the same reaction to the Pfizer one.

That’s always my plan for myself and my family every time we’ve got any vaccines.  Also I find if we are well rested on the day of  the reactions are as less intense.,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 01:49:57
Did you have any of those symptoms with the first dose?,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 03:58:25
First dose was fever and fatigue for a few days. Nothing major,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 04:02:21
I had my first dose on Wednesday.  Just had a sore arm and a headache.  I’m only now noticing I haven’t had much appetite (which I’m ok with cause I’d like to drop a bit of weight) and    still have a headache.  Sometimes my vision seems messed up for a minute here and there as well.  This could be because I am tired though.,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 04:09:21
yea the appetite was pretty concerning for me because I’m pretty thin already. I didn’t actually notice a headache but I always have headaches so who knows,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 04:20:23
How long did you have no appetite for?,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 10:46:52
About 60 hours. It’s pretty much normal now,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 16:07:14

"I had a fever, nausea, and loss of appetite for a few days but all have resolved now.",kkoh5x,2020-12-27 20:36:45
Strange question. Did you have to isolate from people after getting the vaccine?,kkoh5x,2020-12-27 22:28:20
Nope. No live virus whatsoever. My doc told me that I would only be worried about Covid if I developed respiratory symptoms (which aren’t side effects),kkoh5x,2020-12-27 22:44:16

Has anyone tested positive for covid shortly after getting the vaccine?,kkoh5x,2020-12-31 03:22:25
I know people can but generally that means they were infected either before the shot or within the first few days. The first dose provides good protection after about 10 days,kkoh5x,2020-12-31 04:55:41
I am 24 hours past first dose of the vaccine. My arm is sore and at about the 12 hour mark I got cold sweats and dizzy (like I was going to throw up). I kind of felt rushed into my decision to get the vaccine and am really not sure I wanted to. I’m terrified to get the second dose in 3 weeks.,kkoh5x,2021-01-02 02:36:58

Thank you!  I hope it is okay that I ask a question....  I am in my late 30s and scheduled to get the first dose of Pfizer vaccine on Friday.  I am thinking about trying to get pregnant in a year or two.  Do I need to be worried that that this vaccine will affect my chances of a healthy pregnancy or impact the fetus in anyway?

"Take that cats!

My question is, do we need a new shot every year like the Flu shot, or is it like the measles vaccine that you only need once?",kjn0vv,2020-12-30 17:02:00
"May I ask in what field you work? Medicine? Biology?

I studied biology for a little bit, but not to the point that I have deep knowledge and that was a long time ago (so I need someone who knows more and can answer :)). Anyways, with what I know/believe I wonder:

With the vaccination you only have parts of the virus enter the body,  also these parts enter the body - not over, for example, the respiratory system (like the virus) but are injected into cells of your arm. (Can this differrnce play a role?)

So your immune system obviously doesn‘t deal with the real thing. It deals with parts of it also in 2 time intervalls. It deals with something that is a manmade thing not a real virus. The circumstances are just a little different that with a virus infection.

Can the immune system learn a wrong fact with the vaccination and maybe later recignize things as a health threat that are not a threat? (Like with allergies)


And what I also wonder: might it influence the immune system in the way it fights infections we contract in the futute in a negative way? 
Because you know - it might learn something „wrong“.. and treat the virus like part of a virus instead of treating it like a virus? 
I don‘t know - but hope you can explain.",kjn0vv,2020-12-31 08:21:34
Ok thanks for your explanation.,kjn0vv,2021-01-01 09:02:35
"This is a great way to explain it. I’m going to use it, if you don’t mind! Had my first dose of Moderna on the 30th. I have no qualms about it, but then, I’ve done enough reading on it that I feel fairly confident that the vaccine is overall safe enough and effective enough to be worth the risk of taking it.",kjn0vv,2021-01-03 06:17:40

"It starts to get very complicated at that point, and ends up falling well beyond what my little metaphor can handle. But suffice to say that when a T-cell encounters antigen on the surface of an “antigen presenting cell”, or APC, there are multiple receptors that get triggered to ensure that it is indeed encountering a novel antigen, and that it does not also attack the APC.  Kind of like the kids having three-factor password protection on their TikTok accounts, if I had to cram it into the confines of my story.",kjn0vv,2020-12-27 16:13:57

"That’s great!  I received the Pfizer vaccine a week ago, and aside from a day of soreness at the injection site, the only side effect was a profound sense of relief, and hope.",kjn0vv,2020-12-31 21:48:26
"I’m not an expert, so definitely consult your OB, but I think it’s extremely unlikely.  The rumors about the vaccine effecting fertility started because pregnant women were excluded from the initial vaccine trials.  Some people concluded that that implied the vaccine somehow effected pregnancy, but there is no data to back that up at all.  There was also some concern that one of the proteins the vaccine targets shares an amino acid sequence with proteins that form the placenta.  The sequence is extremely short, a very small part of the overall protein, and this theory ignores the fact that it is the three dimensional shape of the protein that the vaccine targets, which would be drastically different in the virus and in a placenta.  Our immune system is designed to attack unicellular organisms within our bloodstream, so I personally believe the odds of it attacking an embryo or fetus or a placenta in the womb are vanishingly small.  Not to make light of your concerns, but dying of covid is a lot more likely to impact your odds of getting pregnant than the vaccine is, IMHO.",kjn0vv,2021-01-05 05:06:21
"Only time will tell, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this ended up being similar to the flu shot.",kjn0vv,2020-12-31 21:47:21
"I’m just a dumb surgeon, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  First of all, the vaccine does not inject a part of the virus, but rather mRNA for a part of a part of the virus.  Basically, it introduces blueprints for small part of the “spike protein” which helps the virus invade our cells.  Our cells then read those blueprints and print out proteins, which are displayed on cell surfaces in order to mount an antibody response.  So it is only “manmade” in the sense that it is made in the cells of men (and women).  Your immune system doesn’t care if these proteins were introduced to your body through your lungs or through your arm, there’s no way for it to know. And, with the infinitude of possible genetic sequences for proteins and the shapes that proteins can fold into, the odds of your immune system somehow creating antibodies that would one day bind to an identical protein that might have otherwise been somehow beneficial to you is vanishingly small, and isn’t something we’ve seen in any other vaccines.  The likelihood of incurring harm due to covid infection would far outweigh the risk of harm from the vaccination.",kjn0vv,2020-12-31 21:45:58

Curious to see how everyone tolerated the vaccine and hoping for some positive changes!",kh9j84,2020-12-21 21:13:42
"I had it Friday. Very sore arm but working through it was fine (manual job). My eyes started puffing up slightly 48 hours later which was weird and my other arm started hurting too, but no other symptoms.

"I got the Pfizer last week. My arm was sore for a day, like after carrying a heavy shopping bag. I might have gotten the slightest bit of chills (it was more like goosebumps on the back of my neck) for half an hour and that was it.

2. Massaged injection site whilst waiting during 15 min observation.
3. Took Tylenol upon arriving home
4. HOT shower with massage function on.
5. Continued movement with arm that was injected.

I'm a little bit sore, but nothing worse than a flu shot 🤷🤷",kh9j84,2021-01-18 07:49:32
Taking some random x pills at a rave seems less daunting than taking this vaccine. Tell us how u feel soon,kh9j84,2020-12-21 11:29:43

"On my 5 days post vaccine, I developed a fever and a few other mild flu like symptoms. I'm inclined to believe I've contracted some other viral illness, but has anyone else had similar symptoms post vaccination?",kh9j84,2020-12-30 04:20:02
"Totally understandable. I read an article from a doctor who took it and had similar symptoms. I’m sorry you had these issues. Luckily I’ve not had these issues nor have any of my coworkers, but I know that this has happened to some others",kh9j84,2020-12-22 21:43:50
Which vaccine you got?,kh9j84,2020-12-24 08:21:54
Just read your description. Mine seems like a dialed down version of yours. Fever only to 100.9 and flu-like stuff at it’s worst for only 12 hours. Even after my milder response I’m dreading that second dose. I can only imagine how you feel!,kh9j84,2020-12-24 18:40:41
"Better today. First day @12 hour mark injection site sore like a flu shot. Woke up next day, any tightening of deltoid felt bad - tolerable but worse than any other infection I’ve had. 

Before 24 hrs was febrile (100.9 max) w/headache, chills, body aches that ranged from “overworked muscles” to flu-like aches and increased fatigue. 

Day 2 (yesterday) was a long travel day (7 hrs flying, 5 driving) on little sleep so not sure if I can still blame fatigue today on the vaccine but exhausted today. 

Worst of the symptoms lasted about 12 hours. Arm still slightly sore to touch. Headache was prob most persistent, lasting about a day and a half, but again the worst was 12 hrs. Truly not looking forward to dose 2, but even if I’m down for a week would prefer this over what I’ve seen in COVID patients since March.",kh9j84,2020-12-24 18:36:27
"How are you feeling now? I got it pretty much same time as you. I have injection site pain, headache, sleepy, everything kinda hurts mildly lol.",kh9j84,2020-12-22 19:21:00

"Much better on the third day. Had to do major traveling about 60 hrs after and the main thing was fatigue by that time. 

Just got my second on Monday. A little worse than the first but basically the same symptoms. I had to gage steroids about 3 days prior to the vaccine this time so that may have dampened the effects? I’m still mildly achy 56 hrs after and very fatigued. Taking ibu every 6-8 hrs this time around.",kh9j84,2021-01-14 04:30:24
It will go back to normal next year or I would bet everything I have there will be a civil uprising. In the UK people are at the end of their tether.,kh9j84,2020-12-22 17:58:14

Question if anyone can help. I took the vaccine yesterday and it was until last night I started to feel flu like symptoms. I have yet to take any medicine and am wondering if I could take any at all? The only symptom I’m really feeling is a headache and muscle aches.,kfqthf,2020-12-19 21:48:24

Why’d you get the vaccine? Did you have corona or something,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 02:10:52
Did the hospital give it to you? How did you schedule it? I’m a pharmacy worker and am eligible for phase 1a in my state but I don’t know how or where to schedule an appointment for vaccination.,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 02:39:51

"I’m not really the best person to ask but my opinion is that the US needs to take the advise of the CDC and health officials. Other countries have done this (and have seen results) - maybe then we could get there, but right now our numbers are proving that the majority of people are unable to mask up and keep socially distanced. 

I have friends from various countries and the comparison between their daily cases and ours is astounding. In my state we average 2000+ cases a day, there are COUNTRIES that haven’t seen those numbers in months, and are “back to normal” because they took quarantine seriously. Until the US is ready to do that, this is our new normal.",kf7vt9,2020-12-18 00:57:23
Assuming the ideal amount percentage takes it. I think it was over 65% we would see signs around summer. But I’m just going by what I’ve been hearing in the news.,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 05:31:53

Tragic people think we will ever go back to ""normal"" 

We will see ""mutation"" after mutation requiring shot after shot until all the dissenters have been weeded out.

[removed],kf7vt9,2020-12-18 12:33:25
"Because I work at a hospital.

I would never take it because it has something that changed my dna and a solar flare is about to happen so I don’t wanna miss out 🥱,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 02:14:15
"Pregnant patients and breastfeeding patients are absolutely eligible to get the vaccine. Currently, neither of those are contraindications to getting the vaccine. In the United States, at least, the only real consensus is it's-kinda-up-to-the-mom. Anyone who tells you that you can't or shouldn't get the vaccine is really just injecting their opinion right now.

The reason for the confusion is currently because there isn't a lot of data in pregnant or breastfeeding patients. There's no information that actually suggests harm in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers. There just isn't enough information to draw conclusions. Because of this lack of information, the UK actually advises against vaccinating pregnant and breastfeeding patients until more information is available. But, that advice isn't based on any known risk at this point.

Notably, we do actually have some scant evidence right now. There actually were pregnancies that happened incidentally in the trials, even though they were supposed to be excluded. In the Pfizer study, the vaccinated group saw **12 pregnancies and none were lost**. In contrast, the **placebo arm had 11 babies, and 2 were lost**. (source: https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download). In the Moderna vaccine trial, the **vaccinated group had 6 pregnancies with no losses**. Also, **7 pregnancies happened in the placebo group and 2 losses occurred** (source: https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download). These are small numbers for sure, but it's the only hard data that we've got on the vaccine and pregnancies. It seems promising though, and honestly, it makes sense. There's no substantiated theory that suggests that the mRNA vaccines hurt babies. On the other hand, sustained high-grade fevers from an illness are known to increase the risk of miscarriage. I'm guessing that's what happened in the placebo arm. 

As for breastfeeding... well, we're in the same boat again about a lack of information. The **American College of Gynecology** recommends NOT withholding the vaccine purely because of pregnancy; they kinda just leave it up to the mom (source: https://www.acog.org/en/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-Pregnant-and-Lactating-Patients-Against-COVID-19). According to **ACIP guidelines in the U.S.**, only two vaccines aren't allowed in breastfeeding patients - 1.) Smallpox, and 2.) Yellow Fever. Every other approved vaccine out there is actually safe for breastfeeding patients (source: https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/vaccinations.html).

It's a hard choice for sure. I don't envy people who are carry babies or breastfeeding right now.

Lastly, I bummed a lot of these easy-to-read numbers from a coworker's Facebook feed. If you guys are interested in reading her unadultured thoughts, I'm happy to post a link to her profile, but I didn't want to act like shill.",kf7vt9,2020-12-18 04:08:39
"Odd, we were advised NOT to get it if pregnant, breast feeding, or planning to get pregnant within three months.",kf7vt9,2020-12-18 03:14:04
I’m not sure if you’re a troll or just seriously misinformed..,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 02:16:52
Thank you!! There are just so many unknowns :/ my little is 4 months old and we both made it through covid and I breastfed while I had it so I would assume she has some antibodies also.,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 04:38:17
"Hi, I just blocked that user. He used a racial slur as well. I’m glad you posted your result. I’m a retired RN, not quite old enough for the old folks group.  So unlikely to get it in near future. 

Someone needs to point out that injections, perhaps with small amounts of insulin being the exception, involve a large amount of liquid, semi viscous in this case, and it displaces tissue. It’s going to be sore. I think tetanus was the worst for me because it was a high volume and thick to boot. What I find intriguing is that none of the injectors seem to Z track the injection. I always used that especially for irritating meds like Demerol. Also I find a bit of heat applied helps it disburse faster as does moving the injected muscle. I’ve given hundreds of flu shots at the drug store and not a single person ever complained that it hurt. What hurts if you want to talk about pain, is lip fillers. Lol that kills!",kf7vt9,2020-12-21 23:49:52
kinda but i wasn’t lying about not taking it and the stuff in the vaccine changing our dna 😐,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 02:18:08
"For sure, it kinda feels like a catch-22. Organizations can't make a recommendation because of the lack of information. Yet, the trials are too concerned about the complexities of pregnancy and babies to study them.

While there isn't any information about the COVID vaccine and breastmilk, the passing of antibodies to babies does seem to be one of the big benefits of breastfeeding. We just don't know if that applies to COVID-19, but that seems like a pretty intuitive link. I hope that's what's happening to your baby too right now.",kf7vt9,2020-12-18 05:23:23
"That would be an interesting study. I’m not an advocate for needlessly stabbing babies to get a blood sample. But if there was a way to get an antibody titer from saliva that would be a fantastic way to find out if breast milk, which is known to pass on antibodies can also pass on enough to be measurable and effective. I image colostrum would confer the best immunity. I’m so happy for you that you are both well!",kf7vt9,2020-12-21 23:55:18
That’s not accurate. You can find factual information about the vaccine on the CDC’s website.,kf7vt9,2020-12-18 02:21:00

It had no appearances on my arm (no redness.) i wasn’t able to sleep on that side the first night. But work and everything was fine.
