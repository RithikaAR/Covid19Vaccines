Deaths from blood clots reported - not hospitalisations,2,nr5ezj,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/nr5ezj/deaths_from_blood_clots_reported_not/,2,"I just had one relative in England who ended up in hospital last week with blood clots in the lungs after the second shot of AZ vaccine. Her and many others were in hospital with the same condition but were treated in the exact same way as you would if you had a stroke with shots of anti-coagulant into the stomach and kept on a respirator. Thing is, she was told it had nothing to do with her second shot of the vaccine, as were all the others in the same ICU in the beds next to her suffering the same ailment. Interesting to note that only deaths from blood clots are being reported -- not hospitalisations from blood clots. Might be best to opt for the Phizer vaccine if you have a choice.",1622725458.0,2021-06-03 06:04:18

Migraine and tinnitus side effect,8,nq01uo,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/nq01uo/migraine_and_tinnitus_side_effect/,2,"The evening of the first dose (Pfizer) I started getting a migraine with a pulsating pressure feeling that extended to my ears. I’ve never had a migraines and rarely took pain killers for headaches. After a week and a half I went to a clinic for migraine medicine and the doctor said she could not prescribe it without an MRI. I decided to wait it out and look online to see if anyone else experienced this. Some article mentioned the cause being neuro inflammation. 

Decided to take some curcumin (tumeric) pills to see if it could help by reducing inflammation. The pain and pressure slowly dulled out within two days of taking the curcumin. 

A friend recommended this to her roommate who was having the same side effects for two months. Her roommate thanked me a few days later because the curcumin was helping her. I’m glad it helped her and also find it interesting to know it wasn’t a coincidence on my end. 

I’m not a doctor nor one of those essential oils people and I do believe in modern medicine. Just have an asian dad that has been trying to get me to take tumeric for two years. This whole thing was debilitating and I’m relieved it’s gone now. The second dose gave me chills and fatigue for a day, no migraine! Yay!

0-2 Hrs: No side effects. ""Easiest shot I've ever had."" I was a bit sad that I didn't get Pfizer for some reason. 

2 Hrs: Arm began to get sore, minor head ache, a bit sleepy

4Hrs: Definitely sleepy, ready for bed but stayed up until about 10:30pm.

6Hrs: In Bed. Arm is noticeably sore, but still able to sleep on it. 

12-13Hrs: Woke up feeling tired. Had a hard time getting out of bed for work. Got ready for work and felt dazed and had some chills while drying off and getting dressed.

14-18Hrs: At work feeling kind of out of it, but it's an interesting (not necessarily a bad) feeling. Not sure if it's phycological. Slight chills, with a slight head ache. Arm feels sore, but should feel fine in about 18-36 more hours. Slight chills and minor lingering head ache.

Vaccine nightmares . Did you really get it done!?,0,nm303q,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/nm303q/vaccine_nightmares_did_you_really_get_it_done/,3,"Sleep specialists are hearing stories like this from their patients.

“We’re seeing a lot of anecdotal reports,” says Dr. Dan Shade, a sleep specialist at the Allegheny Health Network. “The literature really doesn’t support this right now, but it’s early.”

After immunization, or with a COVID infection, or just during the pandemic in general, Dr. Shade says his patients have commented on bizarre dreams.

“Along with a lot of viral or serious illnesses, is that it really affects the sleep wake cycle,” he explains.

He doesn’t have a precise explanation, but guesses it has something to do with poor sleep from the anticipation of side effects.

“They’re expecting to experience fever, muscle pain, headache and they’re probably not sleeping well,” he says. “The most common reason we remember dreams is our sleep is disrupted.”

Whether the immune response is reacting with brain cells, it’s too soon to say.

“We’re going to look back on the data years from now, and you know what, these dreams weren’t just PTSD, there was actually a physiologic cause for it,” says Dr. Shade.

If a booster dose is needed in the future, the intense dreams won’t stop Richard. ”

Ventilator versus feeling a little bad, a bad dream. I’m sorry, but I’ll take that tradeoff,” he says.

Severe illness with COVID would be the bigger nightmare.

Testicle pain immediately following Moderna vaccine,16,nk1cbr,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/nk1cbr/testicle_pain_immediately_following_moderna/,29,"39 y/o caucasion male. I am a healthy and active EMT (or at least I was before the vaccine). I received the initial Moderna injection on 12/26/20. I had sharp pain in my right testicle within about 30 seconds of the shot. I have neither had any genitourinary issues nor any adverse reactions to any vaccines ever in my life. In fact I was in perfect health. The vaccines have resulted in a cascade of health issues that I am still dealing with today.

I thought it was a strange side effect that would go away, but the pain built throughout the following days, so I saw my doctor. He diagnosed me with Epididymitis and prescribed me 10 days of the antibiotic Bactrim DS. He stated that there was no way that the testicle pain was related to the vaccine, and advised me to go forward with the second shot. The antibiotic mostly cleared up the pain, but there was some lingering dull ache in my testicle and burning pain in my inner thigh.

On 1/23/21 I reluctantly received the second Moderna vaccine. The immediate testicle pain was much more severe this time, with pain radiating around my pelvis, down my legs and into my lower back. Again I went to my doctor. He informed me that I now had nerve pain and suggested that I had Chronic Epididymitis. He prescribed me Doxycycline, which did nothing for the pain. He again stated that the Vaccine was not related to the vaccine. At this point I said ""bullshit"" to that and went to a urologist. Meanwhile, I began to suffer from the worst pain I've ever had in my life that persisted for months. At all times, it felt as though I had just been kicked in the nuts.

The urologist recommended I take 1200 mg of ibuprofen and 3000 mg of Tylenol a day, and said I had chronic Epididymitis. Eventually I began to have very painful ejaculation and urination and was diagnosed with a bacterial prostate infection and Chronic Prostatitis. After weighing the risks, I started a course of the powerful flouroquinolone antibiotic Levofloxacin. It was working for the infection symptoms, but I developed frightening tendon and joint pain in my legs. I ceased the medication but the horrible pain in my legs has persisted. The prostate pain has returned and now I am forced to have to take other antibiotics for 1-3 months to eradicate the infection.

Unfortunately I have missed a lot of work and income over the last 4-5 months. My life was great before the vaccine and now everyday is a painful hell. Is there anyone else that has experienced these symptoms? Have you found anything that helps? Thank you.",1621900918.0,2021-05-24 17:01:58

My temp goes from 98.6F to 101.8F and then back down in the matter of minutes. Also feel swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the injection arm. All this is totally normal especially for young people because we have good immune systems and this means our bodies are working to produce the antibodies l.

Covid vaccines for the non-vulnerable make no sense due to it being an evolving disease like the cold,14,nffgn7,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/nffgn7/covid_vaccines_for_the_nonvulnerable_make_no/,28,"Covid differs from Smallpox, measles, polio and other diseases for which we have vaccines in that it rapidly evolves and develops new strains. Covid can now be regarded as endemic in the world. It makes sense for vulnerable people to get vaccinated if they don't yet have some immunity to Covid, but there is some indication that vaccinating non-vulnerable people may be unnecessary and actually add to the health burden of nations:

(i) Over-vaccination of the population could lead to new Covid strains evolving to find ways around the effectiveness of current vaccines.

(ii) There are unknown long-term effects. These vaccines are still experimental.

(iii) Short term adverse reactions to the vaccine are putting additional   strain on health services, e.g. many people in the UK are attending hospital with severe headaches or other concerning symptoms following vaccination. Side effects leading to death or serious illness are rare, but the need to be cautious in response to adverse reactions is putting pressure on doctors and hospitals.

(iv) T-cell long term immunity, as with SARS from 2002, is likely contributing to herd immunity in addition to the vaccination program, mitigating the need for the non-vulnerable to be vaccinated.

(v) Given that the vulnerable are currently suffering from Covid in e.g. India, and doctors in developing countries are dying, should we not be redirecting all vaccines through the COVAX program before vaccinating the non-vulnerable in richer nations, e.g. the UK and US, where the   vulnerable populations have already largely been vaccinated?

(vi) There is not yet sufficient evidence that the vaccines reduce transmission, or understanding of the mechanism by which they would do so. They don't produce the same kind of immune response in the lungs that natural immunity produces to reduce transmission. If however, as some studies show, they reduce transmission via another mechanism (e.g. less viral load being detected in the nostrils), then that would indicate that Covid cannot be transmitted by asymptomatic cases which also have very low viral load (the majority of the cases diagnosed in   young people). Therefore, if the vaccines reduce transmission as a result of reducing viral load, then asymptomatic transmission was never a thing in the first place, and vaccines for children and young adults are therefore unnecessary. If the vaccine does not reduce transmission, then vaccines for the non-vulnerable are also unnecessary due to non-vulnerable people having such a low probability of developing illness due to Covid.

With static diseases, it is important for non-vulnerable to get vaccinated to protect the more vulnerable who can't be vaccinated, but that is not the case for coronaviruses which evolve more rapidly. Future strains of Covid will naturally become as harmless as a cold within the near term,   but could this be compromised by over-vaccination of the population?

I'd be interested to know your thoughts on the above, and please let me know if there is a better placed forum to raise these points/ask these questions. Thanks.",1621384860.0,2021-05-18 17:41:00

So, for starters the CDC states that having the covid vaccine doesn’t mean you can’t get it, so this means you still get covid if you have the vaccine and I’ve seen plenty of cases myself of this happening so this is a fact that you can get covid while being fully vaccinated. On top of that the CDC also states that you can still infect others of you have the vaccine and have covid. SO, why would they be saying that it’s okay to not wear a mask if you are vaccinated when in fact having the covid vaccine does not prevent you from getting covid or transmitting it to others. Am I the only one who finds that inconspicuous?? Because the only logic that I find out of that is covid is not as bad as it has been portrayed to be and we have been lied to. Now I ask most people about the vaccine they think they are no longer harming society and they think they are saving lives because of the vaccine but in reality the only life they are saving is their own and nobody else’s. Based on exactly what the CDC says, the vaccine is something that is only self beneficial so you don’t die if you have covid. This would also mean that all of the covid vaccinated vs non vaccinated rules do absolutely nothing except discriminate those who have gotten the vaccine vs those who have not

"Pro-vaccine, want to wait, but parents are inducing incredible levels of stress.",17,ncb7qi,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/ncb7qi/provaccine_want_to_wait_but_parents_are_inducing/,30,"Hello!

I have weird situation regarding the vaccine and I wanted some advice. For context: I am generally am pro-vaccine, I think they are a good thing and we should be getting them, even making them mandatory in some cases. I my self am fully vaccinated despite multiple issues with doctors and poor vaccine practices, and still think it was the correct choice though it may be not have been handled well by my parents. My mother is what you would call a ""Google Doctor"" and my father historically does not care about opinion on anything medical and will trust anything in a white coat without any scrutiny.

This is where the Covid thing comes in. I DO NOT believe the vaccine is unsafe. It doesn't make sense for it to be, because if it was these companies that provides are ef\*\*\*\*\*d so bad. They would be lucky to not have a business and more likely would end up persecuted for malpractice etc. I will most likely get the vaccine in due time.

However, I want to wait. My reason being that from my research the vaccine is known to last about 6-8 months. Which leads me to believe that this is a stop gap measure, as if this is the only vaccines ever created it would become a bi-yearly thing which I'm not very okay with doing. for personal reasons. The spreads of variants are concerning as well, as this is a virus similar to the flu and mutations are inevitable. I want to know what the long term solutions are before making the step. I also want to see more about edge cases in these vaccines which we will only be able to see with many many people of different types getting vaccinated. I my self am in a weird group where I could be asymptomatic, but I could also have a bad reaction to it due to sensitive lungs. Which currently seems like the vaccine can trigger as well (though you cannot get covid from it, the process of making the antibodies can product covid-like symptoms), so I'm worried about my reaction to the vaccine being more pronounced. On top of this I work from home (permanently), and I'm about to make a move to the cow-filled-rural part of Texas where the spread is very low. Meaning I am not overly exposed to others.

My parents have been hounding and guilt tripping me with every bit of information they can find. Its has gotten to the point that the more I hear about it from them, the less I feel open to talking about it with them and more I want to wait. Even though that is a very irrational response on my end. I am so tired of it, and I can't even rebuttal without them pulling the ""you should trust us we know everything"" attitude. Combined with them believing my boyfriend is the devil and they blame him for everything, (He is not, he is just a veteran from being medic in the military so he likes guns and tends to be more skeptic of authority than they are) the tension is really stressful. I know they mean well and they are just worried, but at the same time I feel so attacked by everyone and my own parents for just wanting some time to collect, research, and process, that its become an issue for my mental health. 

I really need some advice on how to talk to them about it. Perhaps information or sources I can provide, or examples to give. Or even just knowing I'm not as absolutely insane about not being 100% on board with these vaccines.

Thank you all in advance for any advice you give me.",1621034686.0,2021-05-14 16:24:46

J&J vaccine still dealing with issues 5 weeks after need advice and support,14,nbmizr,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/nbmizr/jj_vaccine_still_dealing_with_issues_5_weeks/,21,"
Copy and pasting this from another post, tried to post on covidvaccinated but I think my post was hidden. Not antivax just very scared and confused.

Posting on a throwaway account because theres an antivaxxer cross posting posts on a conspiracy sub, and I feel embarrassed talking about this but I don’t know where to turn. I’m getting a little worried and I have been to the ER twice and talked on the phone with my doctor a couple times already and saw her in person. I can’t find any answers after researching my head problems on google (as anything that comes up for brain inflammation is scary life threatening diseases and I’m not feeling any severe mental declining aside from my anxiety) and I’m trying to make sure this is normal. I got the vaccine April 8th. Symptoms started the 12th. I’m 22F and do not drink or smoke or do any drugs. 

I’m dealing with some kind of weird head/nerve/brain inflammation that just will not go down. It’s given me brain fog and fatigue. There has been SOME improvement and as of today I do not feel any shocking electric sensations or ice pick headaches, or brain fog, which I have been feeling the last few weeks, but as of now if I do to much activity (even as simple as talking too much) my head feels like it gets swollen and like my brain is pressing against my skull (not painful, I just get head pressure) then it gets itchy and tingly and buzzy. Sometimes in random spots it will feel hot and burning. The zapping and ice picks are in random parts of my head but the itching and tingling is near the bottom of my head near my upper neck. My neck feels stiff as well. Sometimes my body feels feverish too if I don’t “take things easy” and now when I wake up in the morning my body feels achy. 

I want to feel peace of mind after getting two CT’s and two MRI’s done and there not being any abnormalities, but I’m just not feeling better and I don’t know if I can continue resting as I need to work. I’m 5 weeks out now from J&J. I’ve been trying to take magnesium and other vitamins but it’s not letting up. I do take Advil and yes it helps but it’s not good to take NSAIDS every hour on the hour. I do have an appointment with a neurologist in June but am worried something worse will happen before I can see them.

Can anyone give me some peace of mind? What tests do I need to get done to make sure my immune system isn’t completely working against me now? What can I tell my doctor? 

Full disclosure yes I do have major health anxiety. If these are all somehow psychological symptoms then that would be the best case scenario and I fully acknowledge this could be anxiety, but I’m still feeling this, it’s scary and I just wanna get better and move forward.",1620956626.0,2021-05-13 18:43:46

After my first dose of Pfizer, I didn’t really deal with too much. My arm was just sore at the injection site for about two days, so I didn’t sleep on that side. 

My second vaccine dose was pretty recent on the 6th of May.  About 17 hours in, I felt pretty icky. For me, it was like a discomfort in the stomach and all over in that area, kind of like if you were about to go on your period? My lower back and stomach felt like it was cramping and I had a faint headache. I felt nauseous and couldn’t sleep. I took Tylenol about every six hours after the shot, so I think that probably helped mitigate some of the side effects from getting worse. I did develop a very low grade fever (99.2) but altogether these side effects only lasted about a day and a half. My arm wasn’t nearly as sore, but I might attribute that to doing the “arm circles” (exercise) I heard people recommending. 

Yesterday on the 8th, I noticed spotting which is unusual for me because I usually head right into bleeding as soon as my period starts. It was also early for my period to start, usually it accelerates two days ahead every month (so if I had it on the 14th last month, I would get it on the 16th on the next.) On this time around, it came 6 days early. As of earlier around 4:00 AM today, I went to the bathroom and noticed I’m bleeding much heavier than usual. My blood clots are a lot larger and more frequent, to the point of (this is a little tmi) those clots just slipping into the toilet pretty shortly after sitting down. I was wearing an overnight, thick pad and it was also riddled with these clots. I’m not taking it too seriously because I know others are having period problems, but it’s still a little disconcerting. That’s pretty much all. 

To conclude on a slightly humorous but informative note, the pain in my abdomen is bad enough to where it hurts to stand up straight, so my posture is terrible and hunched when I get up and I joked to myself that I ought to invest in a cane. It’ll pass, but how are you guys doing with your period / after the vaccine?",1620580928.0,2021-05-09 10:22:08

The thing is, I’m not necessarily feeling a need for myself to get this vaccine. I eat healthy, workout and run, and sleep well. Not once during this pandemic did I feel sickly. 

My parents have said that there are other strains of covid that have the potential and more likelier to injure/ kill younger people. Also that it helps everyone get back to normal if we all get vaccinated.

I feel like the only thing really motivating me to get this vaccine is fear of being judged by the people who believe everyone should get it. I’m not against vaccinations, I just know that I could potentially induce covid symptoms by getting this vaccine whilst never even feeling it throughout the pandemic. I do not see a reason as to why I need to get this. 

Plus the long term effects of this new vaccine are not known. Why even take a chance when I’m a healthy person who takes care of themselves? I’m worried I will get this vaccine just because of fearing the reactions of saying no.

I weighed the benefits/risks and was fully on board with getting a vaccine. However, my partner (we live together) is not yet comfortable getting a vaccine. We have had many discussion both calmly and in arguments.  He works in tech and is quite happy working from home and only leaving our place except to go to the grocery store and the occasional meal outdoors making him less at risk and less likely to spread it.  I don't agree with him, but I support him.  He isn't an extremist, educated in science, and has done his research.  The problem is I don't know how to approach his vaccine hesitancy with my/our friends.  Ethically, we feel that he should disclose his unvaccinated status if someone comes over or if/when we start to meet friends indoors as well as other circumstances.  Pretty much everyone else that I know has been vaccinated or is actively seeking vaccination.  Some are very outspoken about why people should be vaccinated with a number of them being judgmental and not willing to take a moment to hear another point of few.

Pfizer 1st shot - anxious person,19,n2uhz2,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/n2uhz2/pfizer_1st_shot_anxious_person/,10,"Hi all,

I just got my 1st Covid shot (Pfizer) and wanted to post my experience. I am a very anxious person, I have been battling generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks for 13+ years. Part of my disorder is a very severe health anxiety/hypochondria. Prior to scheduling my dose and the days leading up to it, I went on Google and on here to see others' experiences. Seeing good stories helps ease my fears. However, I noticed that a lot of the stories were from those folks who didn't have a good time (sorry guys! Not fun!!), and barely any were of good/positive experiences. So i want to put mine here to give hope to anyone like I was... so far its gone fine.

4/27: scheduled my appointment for 1st and 2nd doses, after months of avoiding it. Took an hour to decide the best time and day to do it, to allow me time to recover from my anxiety without any obligations. Took minutes to actually schedule, and was able to see which vaccine brand was available where (i did cvs; was nervous about j&j and moderna). 10/10

4/27-4/30: my nervous tick was back. Between the anxiety of knowing I had it scheduled, the anxiety of finals coming up in a week, and the anxiety that ways comes right before my time-of-the-month. But was able to manage it. Have been drinking tons of water for the last 4 days, so much so that my pee has been straw-colored to clear. Not drowning in water but drinking it steadily throughout each day.  9/10

5/1: the day arrived. I worked a double today so I was able to distract myself. Had 2 great shifts so I was in a great mood. Then the shift got closer to the end and I knew my appt time was nearing. Began to have a nervous stomach (the shits). Not fun, but manageable. 8/10

5/1: 4:00pm got home from work. Ate lunch, drank tons of water. Had absoluty no appetite. The panic attack starts. At this point, slightly elevated heart rate, cold sweats, slightly shaky, can't focus, and irritable. But used to this feeling. 8/10

5/1: 4:55 pm we head out the door to cvs. The panic attack slowly increases. I had my boyfriend drive me because i knew it would be safer. 8/10 because I know this is JUST panic

5/1: 5:13 pm we are 2 minutes away. Dry mouth sets in. 7/10

5/1: 5:15 pm we get into cvs. I start crying from the panic attack. Luckily my bf is there to help check me in and hold my hand. The woman checking me in is SUPER nice when she sees me crying. 7.5/10

5/1: 5:20 pm I sit down for my shot. I am so thankful that I was seated with an RN (was happy to have a med professional and not just a tech or student) there, and she was a psych RN for 20 years. I felt calm with her, but panic attack was still there. She asked me the regular questions: name, dob, allergies. I have allergies to 2 meds so she tells me ill stay there for 30 mins (so happy). I'm shaking, heart is racing, crying, lightheaded, legs shaking. 5/10 for the panic attack but 14/10 for the nurse

5/1: 5:25 pm she has me turn away so I don't see it. She gives me the shot. The shot itself feels like getting any vaccine. 10/10

5/1: 5:26 pm my panic attack immediately gets worse. Again, just a panic attack because I've felt all these symptoms before AND right before I got the shot. No change in symptoms just heightened. Shaky legs and hands, shaky chest, lightheaded, short of breath, racing heart, fear 6/10

5/1: 5:26-5:40 pm the nurse is so kind and my boyfriend rubs my back and his hand on my knee to keep me grounded (it works guys!!). She just has conversation to keep my mind off the panic while waiting for it to finish. She has me sitting on the ground. Let's me take my mask off to eat a Granola bar that I had in my purse. Drinking tons of water. 7/10

5/1: 5:45 pm start to feel better. She has me walk around. I feel immediately nauseas so I sit back down. It's from the panic, eating, and chugging water. I spit up a bit then feel better. 8/10

5/1: 5:50 pm I'm able to sit in a chair. I get up to pee. Making the walk to the bathroom and using the bathroom helps. Something about the act of urinating sometimes feels like I'm washing out my panic. 8.5/10

5/1: 6:30 pm we get home. Feels good to finally be home. I lay in bed. Arm is just now starting to be sore, just like with my flu shot so nothing extreme. Feels like I got punched by a human (have seen people say they felt like they were punched by a horse, lol). 9/10

5/1: 630-7:40 pm have been laying in bed since I got home. I have frasier playing in the background to distract my thoughts. Scrolling through pinterest to soothe my thoughts. Have peed like 4 times already (I had a lot of water). Bored, but enjoying time to lay down with no obligations. Might get delivery for dinner. No headache yet. 9.5/10

UPDATE:

5/2: 9am trouble sleeping over night, kept waking up and when I woke up I was having chills and sweating. No fever. Arm was very sore but I just moved it around and used it and the soreness went away. 8/10

5/2: 9am-3pm felt feverish but not achey. Highest temp i had was 98.9 at 3pm. Forehead was hot and I had a heat rash on my chest. 7/10

5/2: 3:30 pm felt like feverish feeling was going away. 9/10

5/2: 8pm back to normal, just some lingering anxiety 10/10

5/3: slept through the night, mo night sweats. Feeling fine. Arm just feels tender at the injection site only if I push very hard on it. Feels like I worked out. 10/10

Tl;dr - have a history of anxiety and panic attacks. Had my 1st dose on 5/1 @ 5:15 pm. So far have only had panic attack before the shot that was heightened immediately after. Went away within the hour. Only slight soreness, can still use my arm. No fatigue. Felt feverish but didn't have an actual fever. Back to normal 27 hours after my shot. 

**tip: get at the end of the day or on a day you have nothing to do

**tip: get in the arm you don't sleep on!! And move it around.

**tip: if you are feing anxious, it is normal. The nurse who gave me my shot told me she had 4 other people before me who freaked out. COMMUNICATE your feelings and know YOU ARE NOT ALONE. And PRACTUCE DEEP BREATHING or BOX BREATHING. 

YOU GOT THIS :)",1619941446.0,2021-05-02 00:44:06

A positive experience and some advice,23,n2eh78,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/n2eh78/a_positive_experience_and_some_advice/,2,"I had my second dose of pfizer a few days ago. The only side effects I've had for both doses were mild nausea and appetite loss. I was even doing some heavy lifting afterwards without issue. 

Some advice that has helped me a lot: 

-my nurse for the first shot said to  c o m p l e t e l y   relax my arm, so I did, and maybe that's why I didn't have much soreness. (Did the same for the second dose, but my nurse didn't prompt me to that time)

-stay off subs like this. The number of people posting negative experiences will far far far outweigh those who had an uneventful one.

-Listen to doctors. it takes about eight years to get a medical degree. If you didn't complete eight years of formal study, but still think you somehow know better than tens of thousands of doctors from around the globe, maybe it's time to google ""how to find reliable information sources"". I know that sounded snarky, but i meant it sincerely; I went to a suburban middle school in a well funded district and still remember my 6th grade unit on how to find good sources of info, and there actually is a firm method for it.",1619887686.0,2021-05-01 09:48:06

I've been studying the relation between this new MRNA Vaccine and a possible relation to Prion diseases such as : Alzheimers Disease and ALS . 

There's not a whole lot of evidence or literature regarding this concern, as the vaccine is new and long term side effects are unclear. But i believe there should be more studies and an open discussion about the possibility of such serious side effects. The information I was able to find, was very confrontational. There were a lot of interesting points coming from both sides. But the resounding opinion was that it's more unlikely for such a mutation to occur from the vaccine. 

But personally I am still interested in delving deeper into the subject and would like to hear your thoughts. These are pretty intense accusations, and very serious diseases.

There is plenty of literature apposing the idea of this new mNRA vaccine causing these diseases to occur, but I recommend seeking out literature solely based on mNRA and and the relation to Prions Diseases and how mNRA's effect/change the protein of your cells.

The issue, however, is that we’ve both felt mildly dizzy ever since. We’re still able to function, work, and go to the gym, but it’s just a nagging dizziness feeling as if our equilibriums are slightly off. Also, mildly fatigued on and off. 

This is not accompanied by shortness of breath, headache, leg pain, or chest pain, so I don’t think clotting is the issue. Scheduling a doctors appointment for next week regardless, but is anyone else having long term effects from J&J? Can’t find anything online about it.

Why are jobs forcing workers to get the covid vaccine?,0,n0upo3,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/n0upo3/why_are_jobs_forcing_workers_to_get_the_covid/,66,I don’t understand why many jobs (in nj at least) are forcing employees to get a non-approved vaccine. My local police station is forcing all the police officers to get the vaccine as well and have threatened to fire any employee who does not comply. My workplace is also asking people to get vaccinated. When I told my boss I wouldn’t be getting the vaccination due to the lack of knowledge of the long term effects he told me “if you want to work here it would be in your best interest to get the vaccination.” Thoughts?,1619691604.0,2021-04-29 03:20:04

Moderna vaccine,3,lq33b4,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/lq33b4/moderna_vaccine/,4,"I (32F, yes this might be relevant) received the second dose of this version of the vaccine two days ago, and the expected physical side effects occurred. The first one gave me a migraine which then caused nausea that was bad enough to cause me to vomit. The second one gave me a headache, full body aches and pains, and mild joint pain. I've only heard about people experiencing physical effects, but no mention of emotional/psychological.

I say this because, while I can't say that the vaccine is what caused this, the timing is rather suspect. Today, out of the blue, I became extremely angry. There was absolutely no reason for me to do so. I wasn't doing anything to cause me to become angry, and I wasn't remembering any past experiences that would have been bad enough to reproduce the anger now that I felt then. Over the course of the next few hours, things that are barely mild annoyances suddenly became rage inducing.

I've excluded other things that could be the cause. It wasn't PMS as my period ended last week, I have no mood disorders, and this has never happened before in my recollection. Has anyone else experienced something like this?",1614064976.0,2021-02-22 23:22:56

Effect from 1st Moderna Dose,8,lkhq3c,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/lkhq3c/effect_from_1st_moderna_dose/,12,"Hey all, I've come to share my experience from my first Moderna dose that I received about a week ago. 

Starting off I'm a (fairly) healthy 21yo male. I was on multiple waiting lists for maybe a month until I was finally able to get my appointment. I have a history of minor allergic reactions to penicillin type drugs and solid fear of any needle going into my body. So I was worried about the needle, as I usually feel like I'm going to pass out at the sight or thought, but this time I was more excited to have it done.

As I go into the open area of volunteer physicians administering the vaccine, I'm feeling good! The doctor and nurse were very friendly and comforting, so I felt like I was in good hands. I give the doc a warning about my fear, and he administers it before I could even tell it was ready! It was a pleasant experience so far.

After he put my bandaid on, he started explaining potential soreness and things I could do and take to help alleviate the soreness in my arm. About 1 minute into his spiel (2 minutes after administration), I started to feel off, as if I was nauseated and wanted to throw up. This was proceeded by a wave of coldness that started in my upper body, and bled to all of my extremities. I then began to profusely sweat until they called over a paramedic. He hooked up the wires to me (presumedly an ECG), took my blood pressure and O2 saturation. I'm not not sure what my heart rate was, but I didn't notice any rapid beat or slower beat. My O2 was normal, but my blood pressure had dropped to 70/35 in just a matter of minutes. 

At this point (5 minutes after administration), I was scared I was possibly going to die or pass out at minimum. An ambulance has been called and I'm afraid for my wellbeing. 

All of a sudden (6 minutes since onset of symptoms, 8 minutes since administration), I was feeling better, WAY better. Not 2 minutes ago an ambulance was rushing to take me to the hospital, now I'm feeling just as good as I walked into the place. My blood pressure rises back to normal.  No epinephrine was administered, only time and sitting down. I leave from the chair where my physicians are just as confused as I am, and take a seat in the observation room with a sweat soaked shirt and a crowd of people giving me stares. 

I know I probably should have gone to the hospital like they wanted me to, and I know I probably should have had someone pick me up. But I sat for 15 minutes feeling just fine and drove myself back home as if nothing had happened. 

I also signed myself up for the 2nd dose while I was there. 

Can anybody give me an idea if this was nerves or if I actually had a reaction to the vaccine? I may just be young and dumb enough to go back for the 2nd (worst) dose and accept that the same thing might occur. Gotta love that pandemic pressure!",1613437081.0,2021-02-15 16:58:01

Just wanted to add my experience getting the Moderna Vaccine. I’m a 26yo M Firefighter/EMT Type A+ blood type and I interact with Covid positive patients every day. I was diagnosed with  Covid in April and had the typical flu like symptoms most people are experiencing. (Body aches, chills, fever, and dry cough). I have not been tested or experienced any symptoms since then. It has been over 24 hours since I received the first dose of the Moderna Vaccine and I am experiencing the same symptoms as before minus the cough. Tylenol helps and am also drinking plenty of water and electrolyte solution.

It took me nearly 5 years to find migraine meds that worked for me without upending my life in some other way. My experience has been worse than everyone I personally know. I also am of the belief that everyone who CAN get the vaccine SHOULD and any the typical side effects are still better than COVID any day.

That said- I can’t tell you how glad I am that I was able to schedule my shot for when I would not be working the next day. My first jab was Jan 2 on a Saturday so I had that night and Sunday to recover from mild symptoms. I had a temp of about 99.8 at highest, some chills, and fatigue. I got the second Jan earlier today on a Friday expecting I might need even more time off after hearing it can be worse. Spoiler alert: for me, it has been much worse. I just woke up in the middle of the night with a 100.5 fever, chills so bad I was shaking, and every muscle in my body hurts mostly from bracing against the chills (some vomiting for what seems to be the same reason). 

An hour ago I couldn’t have even typed this. I just showered, took more ibuprofen, pedialight, some Tums to curb the post-vomit reflux, and vitamin C cough drops. Feeling much better now wearing more layers in front of my apartment heater. I’m admittedly anxious from how terrible this is, but trusting that everything is gonna be okay as long as I can keep babying myself. 

You know what would SUCK? If I was expected to work tomorrow. I would absolutely have to call out which I often find makes things even more stressful worrying about my job. My partner was completely fine the next day after his shot, but would it have been the worst thing in the world if he had given himself time just in case?

Many cultures and career fields make us feel like we can never take off work unless we absolutely have to. Friend, this is a great time to advocate for yourself and at the very least plan for some flexibility if you’re going to need it. Do research and gather up supplies that could help you feel better if needed. See if you can draw on any household supports to give you a break. 

Give space and understanding for yourself to feel anxious about the unknowns. Don’t lie about how you’re feeling in attempt not to scare others. The truth might be that you have absolutely no reaction, or you might feel crappy for a little while and we need to acknowledge that is a possibility. Again, if this is my reaction to the vaccine I cannot imagine how absolutely miserable and terrifying having COVID would be.

My grandmother got her 2nd vaccine dose about 30 hours ago. I’m not sure whether it was Pfizer or Moderna, but it was one of the two. She’s about 75 I think, no major medical issues that I’m aware of. 

She couldn’t sleep that night (that was the night before last, she took melatonin last night and got a lot of sleep). Today we were driving and when we got home she sat in the car for about 10 minutes, sweating profusely. She was complaining about nausea about 30 minutes before that (we had ice cream so she chalked it up to being mildly lactose intolerant). I assume nausea isn’t that bad of a symptom but almost fainting/passing out worried me a bit, especially since she had just been driving. 

Is this a relatively common symptom and/or something I shouldn’t be concerned about? I’d like her to call a doctor but she isn’t the type to be worried about this stuff. It’s also possible she just overheated but I’d rather be safe than sorry so I figured I would make a post here.

I spoke with my physician yesterday and he determined that I could get the COVID vaccine (he did not specify which) as long as I was near a hospital when I got it. So, with MUCH trepidation, I received a Moderna vaccination this morning. When I reported my history of anaphylaxis, the nursing staff paused, but proceeded because I reiterated my physician’s approval. I had no reaction beyond a sore arm and a sense of excitement and relief.",1610185356.0,2021-01-09 01:42:36
My reaction to the Moderna vaccine,6,ktaj7b,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/ktaj7b/my_reaction_to_the_moderna_vaccine/,12,"Hi everyone. I am a essential worker, I work in the medical field. I went to go get my vaccine (moderna) this morning and I immediately started feeling tingles in my fingers. The office started getting nervous because that was followed by dizziness and numbness of the entire vaccinated side of my body. Then my vision started to become foggy and I felt in like a dream like state. All I was doing was sitting there crossing my fingers that I wasn’t going to pass out. When I started to get sweats they called a code vaccine and rushed me to the ER (I was being vaccinated at a hospital.) I was monitored for an hour and blood was drawn. All my blood work came back normal, and eventually I was sent home. Before I was sent home I felt the numbness and tingling to going away. But when I stepped down oh my feet from the bed I noticed my foot in a lot of pain. And when the bottom of my foot is pressed it worsens. After about 30 minutes that disappeared. I figured, OK I had a reaction but I’m OK. Now the tingling in numbness is back in my hands and foot. I’m starting to worry that it might be neuropathy.

Has anyone who has been vaccinated had any symptoms similar to mine? I’m starting to get very concerned.",1610165183.0,2021-01-08 20:06:23

Received Moderna vaccine yesterday and had reaction,7,kn71ew,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/kn71ew/received_moderna_vaccine_yesterday_and_had/,19,"I (25/f) work in healthcare and we were offered the moderna vaccine yesterday. I received mine about 3:55pm and within minutes a red area had developed around the site and it was itching. In the next 10 minutes the rash had spread to the entire portion of my upper body and was burning/itching like crazy. I was sent downstairs to the ED after being threatened with an epi pen that I refused (I was breathing fine, no throat itching or closing up feelings). Rash went away after about an hour, I did have some dizziness too with it. I was given a steroid shot. But now it’s been about 20 hours and I feel absolutely terrible! Headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, body aches, etc. Feels like the flu. There’s  soreness at the injection site and some redness still which I feel is expected . Has this happened to anyone else? I don’t think with the reaction I had that I’ll be able to get the next shot..not that I’m sure I want to at this point. Really wish I could have gotten the Pfizer.

Update: I’m feeling much better. It’s 9:30pm and the day after I received the shot. Still with a small headache and soreness at the site with a small rash but so much better!",1609379708.0,2020-12-30 17:55:08
This vaccine is no walk in the park (and why that’s good),14,kkoh5x,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/kkoh5x/this_vaccine_is_no_walk_in_the_park_and_why_thats/,21,"Hey guys,
I’m in a Pfizer trial right now and got my second dose of what I assume is the vaccine on 12/22. I had read all the articles about the side effects being no fun and lemme just say-they’re no fun. I had a fever, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. And I was thrilled about that. 
Immune responses are not usually fun. I generally don’t feel well after most vaccines, but I assume that’s because my immune system is responding as expected. I’m young and generally healthy so I def get a stronger immune response than some. On the bright side, I’m probably covered now!
Please try to get the vaccine on a day where you can rest. I found that my symptoms started around 8 hours post shot and they lasted a solid 72 hours. Not a fun time.",1609040500.0,2020-12-26 19:41:40
How the Covid mRNA vaccines work - a Santa Claus analogy,46,kjn0vv,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/kjn0vv/how_the_covid_mrna_vaccines_work_a_santa_claus/,23,"There has been a lot of misinformation going around about the Covid vaccines currently being deployed, and a lot more good-intentioned skepticism.  Will the vaccine give you covid?  Will it make me sick?  Will it alter my DNA?  Most of this skepticism and fear is due to not simply not understanding how these vaccines actually work.  I thought I’d take a few paragraphs to try to put it into seasonally appropriate terms, using everyone’s favorite metaphor - Santa Claus.

Imagine your cells are Santa’s workshop.

Santa is your DNA, and he works in his office in the middle of the workshop. The nucleus.

Outside of his office, the workshop is full of tiny little elves, also known as your ribosomes.

Santa has a big book of toy schematics, and as Christmas approaches he makes copies of designs from this book, or mRNA, and sends them out of his office to his elves.

His elves use these designs to make toys.  The toys then get sent out of the workshop to be distributed among the children of the world.

The children are your immune system.

Children, of course, know a good toy when they see one.  They watch commercials, they see ads, they have the YouTube.  So when they see a Barbie, or a GI joe, or a baby yoda doll, or a PS5 they recognize it and greedily welcome it into their home.

But one day someone sneaks a design for brussel sprouts into Santa’s workshop. The mRNA vaccine.

It stays out of his office, so it never makes it into Santa’s book, and the old man is none the wiser.

But outside on the factory floor, the elves get a hold of it, and since it looks like any other toy design, they start churning brussel sprouts out by the thousands.  They then place them onto Santa’s sleigh, where he deposits them into stockings all over the world.

But when the kids of the world upend their stockings and a few brussel sprouts roll out, they sense something is wrong.

They reject the brussel sprouts.  They attack the brussel sprouts.  They stomp on them, they crush them in their creepy little fists, they throw them at the cats. (The cats are representative of nothing in my analogy, they just had it coming)

Most importantly, since the kids like to use the TikTok, they record video snippets of this travesty which disseminate around the world.   It takes a while for the word to spread, but eventually it does, and next time the kids of the world see a brussel sprout, they will be ready.

TikTok is your T-Cells.

Now, since the children of the world have been made wise, the next time mom and dad try to serve up brussel sprouts, their kids will recognize the devil’s cabbage, cleverly hidden between the meatloaf and the potatoes, and promptly throw the whole plate across the room at the cat.

That’s basically - no, that’s EXACTLY how these mRNA vaccines work.  They introduce small pieces of RNA into the cell, and the cell uses that to churn out copies of the “spike protein” which stud the envelope of the coronavirus.  The vaccine RNA is then broken down by the cell and goes away.  It never enters the nucleus, and never even sees your DNA let alone alters it, and though it makes a piece of a protein on the coronavirus, it neither uses a virus to enter your cells, nor makes any intact virus which could make you sick.  But since it does make that protein, and alerts your immune system to its presence, the next time your body sees it on the outer envelope of a coronavirus, it throws the whole virus at the cat.

We are not going to see the end of this pandemic until roughly 70% of us are immune to covid.  If that immunity is obtained through infection, it will likely be short-lived, and gained at the expense of millions of lives.  Not an option.  The only option is vaccination.  For vaccination to work, at least about 70% of us need to take the vaccine.  That means, technically, 30% of us can skip it and ride along on the coattails of those who were vaccinated.  But if 50% of us decide to be the 30%, we all lose.  That’s why, even though you might not want to take the vaccine, you should take the vaccine.  You may not like it, but sometimes you just have to eat your brussel sprouts.",1608873447.0,2020-12-24 21:17:27

Mom's vaccine experience,36,kfqthf,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/kfqthf/moms_vaccine_experience/,13,"My mom doesn't use reddit but she works for a hospital and was able to get the first shot of the pfizer vaccine yesterday so I figured I'd give updates.

For information my Mom turns 60 this Monday, only has one kidney and is a overweight but she goes swimming nearly everyday for exercise. So she's not the healthiest person but also not extremely unhealthy either. 

She got it around 6pm 12/17/20 and had no side effects upon receiving it. She came home and we had a normal night and she went to bed like usual around 9pm. 

She has Fridays off but usually wakes up around 6am and goes to the pool around 7am. Today she slept in until 9am and woke up to tell me she felt sick kind of like she had the flu and was going to skip the pool and go back to bed. It's currently just past noon and she's still sleeping. Planning on pushing lots of fluids today but it seems like she's overall fine just having a harder reaction than most. 

I'll update on this post over the next several days.

Edit: 3:42 pm CST

Mom is up and watching TV. Her arm still hurts really bad she says but she's not as nauseous and dizzy. She's drinking lots of water and joking around so I think the worst is over. She's a bit grumpy about her arm but overall doing good.

Edit: 10:43 am 

My mom got up this morning and went swimming for two hours. Says her arm doesn't hurt anymore and she feels perfectly fine. We are currently having a late breakfast but unless anything changes this will be my last update.

Overall: the vaccine might cause flu like symptoms for about 24 hrs but nothing serious so if you tend to react to vaccines just plan ahead just in case and drink lots of water.",1608345356.0,2020-12-18 18:35:56
I received the COVID-19 Vaccine today.,29,kf7vt9,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/kf7vt9/i_received_the_covid19_vaccine_today/,32,"UPDATE: 12/19/2020 1pm

No changes or reactions at all. Soreness of injection site has passed and I don’t feel any aches or pains. From here on I’ll only post update with anything outside of ‘normal’. I receive the second shot on 1/7/2021 so I’ll also be updating then :) Happy Holidays to you all.

UPDATE 12/18/2020 7 am — ~20 hours since vaccination

My headache continued until about 10pm last night, it wasn’t anything worse than what I’m used to with migraines I normally get. I drank a lot of water and went to bed early (for me at least). Site of injection also started becoming sore at this time as well, but felt just the same as when I got the flu shot.

UPDATE 12/17/2020 7pm

So it’s been about 8 hours since injection. No major side effects, just a slight headache throughout the day, but I get migraines often so this wasn’t a huge thing for me. 

I have heard updates from coworkers that received the vaccine a day before and have had site pain, so I’m expecting that tomorrow.

12/17/2020 11am

Like the majority of people here I work at a hospital and was able to receive the first shot of the vaccine today. We all made appointments so it took less than five minutes from check in to injection. Hurt less than the flu vaccine, hardly felt it! Prior to check in we received an information packet, a consent form, and a registration sheet with a QR code that is basically a health tracker to monitor our experience after for the CDC. If you register with this health tracker they will ask for you for updates every day and if you have any side effects so they can accurately monitor them. 

After injection of we waited inside the clinic for 15 minutes for the nurses to monitor any immediate reactions. We received a follow up appointment for our second shot at this time that is 19-23 days from the first dose (mine is 21 days from now). 

(We paid nothing for the vaccine) 

No immediate reactions for myself. No burning or swelling. I’ll follow up with any changes and Updates here.",1608272966.0,2020-12-17 22:29:26

It was my choice. No it didn’t “hurt” any worse than a normal shot. I signed a consent form. And I’ll be given dose 2 in 3 weeks.

Edit 1: 7 a.m. next day. Last night around 10 pm the injection site muscle in my arm started to hurt a ton. So I didn’t sleep on the side with that arm. I’ve had a flu shot that hurt like that one time. With it being cold, I’be had a sinus drainage for a few weeks, so I’ll monitor if that gets better or worse.

Edit 2: I got the second dose two days ago, I ended up having fever, chills, body aches, slight nausea. But my symptoms have since gone down. No more fever, trying to eat again. So my conclusion is it worked.",1608186102.0,2020-12-16 22:21:42
