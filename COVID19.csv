Please post questions about the science of this virus and disease here  to collect them for others and clear up post space for research  articles.

A short reminder about  our rules: Speculation about medical treatments  and questions about  medical or travel advice will have to be removed and  referred to  official guidance as we do not and cannot guarantee that  all  information in this thread is correct.

We  ask for top level answers in this thread to be appropriately sourced  using primarily peer-reviewed articles and government agency releases,  both to be able to verify the postulated information, and to facilitate  further reading.

Please only  respond to questions that you are comfortable in answering without   having to involve guessing or speculation. Answers that strongly  misinterpret the quoted articles might be removed and repeated offenses  might result in muting a user.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/covid19), we highly appreciate it.

Please keep questions focused on the science. Stay curious!",1622491217.0,2021-05-31 13:00:17
