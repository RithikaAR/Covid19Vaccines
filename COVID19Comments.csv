Are there studies comparing masked spread indoors vs unmasked spread outdoors? I'm surprised the CDC is still recommending unvaccinated kids wear masks outdoors when I just haven't heard of events where there was spread.,np1rw6,2021-05-31 14:22:34
"I've recently read an article from the CBC that contained some comments from one Dr. Priya Sampathkumar of Mayo Clinic. He goes on record as saying:

> ""If we allow infection to spread unchecked, in a month or two months or inevitably at some point in time, we'll have another variant that completely escapes all the vaccine""

Further going on to comment the following:

> ""We will be back to square one. We [will] have an entire world's population that will be completely non immune and at risk for dying.""

Now I know that this is a very hyperbolic statement, and in my uninformed layman's opinion it is very irresponsible. Given what we have observed with recent variants effect on mRNA vaccine efficacies, claiming a 100% vaccine escape variant could arise in such a short timespan is simply reckless in terms of public perception.

If such an event is highly unlikely, why make these comments? Is this even a realistic fear in regards to SARS-CoV-2?",np1rw6,2021-06-02 19:26:24

"How does the rate of myocarditis in young adult males compare between Covid vs. vaccine vs. background rate? 

Background rate myocarditis: 5-20 per 100k (a lot of varying sources)

From vaccine data Israel is saying up to 1 in 3000 or 30 per 100k however this stood out to me: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/israel-reports-link-between-rare-cases-heart-inflammation-and-covid-19-vaccination

""But the rate of myocarditis following vaccination among young men was higher. Ninety percent of the cases picked up in Israel appeared in men, and although myocarditis is normally more common among young men, the rate among those vaccinated was somewhere between five and 25 times the background rate, the report says.""


5-25x background rate is a big variation and its really vague without specific numbers. What is the background rate they're actually assuming?

Good COVID Myocarditis data is just coming out and seems focused on athletes - which I guess is fine if we're talking young men, but would love to see better data: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548

""In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive collegiate athletes undergoing comprehensive cardiovascular testing, the prevalence of clinical myocarditis based on a symptom-based screening strategy was only 0.31%.""

The implied Covid-induced myocarditis rate here is 300 per 100k. But I'm curious how many Myocarditis cases actually have been observed (in hospital, in clinic) had a study/follow-up like this not been done. Most young men are not getting their hearts followed around.",np1rw6,2021-06-02 16:30:37
"There's been several studies comparing immune responses from previously infected vaccinated people and naive vaccinated people with 1 or 2 doses and the results have been interesting, but there hasn't been much discussion in those papers about _which_ variant the previously infected people had.

"If I can tag on a related question:

Is there any reason to suspect SARS-CoV-2 to mutate faster than other viruses?

As far as I can see, all the logic around ""_action_ will lead to variants"" statements apply just as much to any existing virus as it does SARS-CoV-2.

The only reason I know of that might suggest rapid mutation is the simple fact that it's a relatively new virus (for humans), and therefore the potential benefit of mutations is much higher. But as time goes on the average potential benefit of each mutation will diminish.",np1rw6,2021-06-03 08:02:13

"There was a great paper out a couple of days ago that suggested the population fraction needed for ""herd immunity"" depends heavily on the Rt and hence of the prevalent variant(s).  The conclusion was that for the most transmissible variant studied (I believe it was B.1.617.2 with Rt \~= 7) the vaccinated fraction of the population was very high, like well over 90%.  Notably, herd immunity is not a clear cutoff and behavioural factors are very important.  It depends on a combination of elements (vaccinations, behavior, transmissibility) need to achieve a net R<1.

An alternative slightly good-but-discouraging article is the recent nature paper [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00728-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00728-2) that suggests that herd immunity may remain elusive  \[ ""Five reasons why COVID herd immunity is probably impossible"" \].",np1rw6,2021-06-02 04:39:30
"It's not a magical hard line, it's more like infectiousness drops over time for the vast majority of people, and by 10 days most people are sufficiently non-infectious that regulators usually draw the line there.

"> What causes higher transmissibility from one variant to the next?

That isn't what happens. What happens is that you get (essentially) random variations in transmissibility in both directions. The more transmissible ones then tend to become more common, by dint of spreading more quickly, while the less transmissible ones don't generally survive very long. 

> Do all viruses follow this trend?

Not all, but it is a general pattern, and it would be very strange for the opposite to occur on any kind of large scale. 

>  Is there an upper limit to how transmissible this virus can become?

Yes. If nothing else, there's the obvious upper limit at the point at which every infected person infects every vulnerable person that they come into contact with. The real limit is likely considerably lower than that for SARS-CoV-2.",np1rw6,2021-06-02 16:05:53
"If a less transmissible variant develops (and they almost certainly have) it will spread less readily (or not be able to spread at all) and be outcompeted by its more competitive cousins so it never attracts much attention.

"The vaccine-induced response is generally regarded as ""better"" (and there is scientific evidence to justify this) due to the fact that the vaccines were engineered to target specific ""good"" targets associated with the virus.

"I was unable to find original report (though there are some additional details in article of Times Of Israel), strange that it's not posted on this subreddit, but I assume 1/3k - 1/6k for vaccinated men between 16 and 24 is CI95%. Also I would assume that comparison with the background could be comparison between two CI95%, so in this case background would be between 1/30k and 1/75k per period of their choice (my guess is 30d). But without data table there are still many uncertainties, for example does 5x - 25x refers to 16-24 age group? In sciencemag's article ""men"" and  ""young men"" are mentioned as the context to this statement.

*Ninety percent of the cases picked up in Israel appeared in* ***men***\*, and although myocarditis is normally more common among\* ***young men***\*, the rate among those vaccinated was somewhere between five and 25 times the background rate, the report says.\*

But wait, there is more... as in other sources on this topic  <30 and 16-19 age groups are mentioned as hit particularly hard. So maybe comparison with the background could be comparison for different age groups and 5x/25x should be multiplied by the most probable value of CI?

As for  ""Most young men are not getting their hearts followed around"", this should be true for vaccinated young men as well. Although ""competitive collegiate athletes "" are very specific subset of population which stresses their hearts a lot and by quickly skimming  the article I wasn't able to find any control/background for that population, so why you are assuming that this is % of ""covid-induced"" myocarditis?",np1rw6,2021-06-03 03:44:32
"Almost all of these studies were done with people infected months previously,  which is likely why they had such good results.  But it also means they probably all had the classic lineages.

2. Again yes.  Some vaccines infect cells which then create spike protein, while others skip that step. And some vaccines use a prefusion-locked trick to show more of the spike to the immune system. A few vaccines use more than just the spike.  In future there will be vaccines with spikes of multiple different lineages. 

3. T cells will probably give high protective immunity regardless.  It's sterilizing immunity that we will see drop off.",np1rw6,2021-06-02 21:30:03

"SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 160 million people and resulted in more than 3.3 million deaths, and we still face many challenges in the rollout of vaccines. Here, we use the high-density microarray patch to deliver a SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit vaccine directly to the skin. We show the vaccine, dry-coated on the patch is thermostable, and delivery of spike via HD-MAP induced greater cellular and antibody immune responses, with serum able to potently neutralize clinically relevant isolates including those from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. Finally, a single dose of HD-MAP-delivered spike provided complete protection from a lethal virus challenge, demonstrating that HD-MAP delivery of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is superior to traditional needle-and-syringe vaccination and has the potential to greatly impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, it is unclear if they can also protect against other coronaviruses that may infect humans in the future. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in humans elicits cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses. Our studies in mice demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination protects against a common cold coronavirus, and that SARS-CoV-1 vaccination protects against SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, infection with a common cold coronavirus also conferred enhanced protection from subsequent infections with other coronaviruses. Mechanistically, both T cells and antibodies mediated cross-protection. This is the first direct demonstration that coronavirus-specific immunity can confer heterologous protection in vivo, providing a rationale for universal coronavirus vaccines.",nqfjpf,2021-06-02 07:50:29
Are we accidentally wiping out the common cold?,nqfjpf,2021-06-02 08:28:41
The word mice is missing from the headline.  Reading the abstract it infers that if you've had the common cold then your system may deal with Sars2 just fine. Probably explains why the majority of people are unaffected by Sars2 or have extremely mild symptoms. Like a cold? Obviously it's not just like a cold for those that develop serious disease from it.,nqfjpf,2021-06-02 09:33:30
"So assuming this turns out to be true - would it not mean if you've had a common cold caused by coronavirus previously,  that you might also have some natural protection against Covid and/or other coronaviruses?",nqfjpf,2021-06-02 13:15:57

"So they say, the SARS cov2 vaccine elicited an efficacy of 71% for SARS cov1 virus.

What about the inverse of that? Does cov1 vaccine give protection against cov2?",nqfjpf,2021-06-03 00:39:05
"First they write:

> In  this  study,  we  show  that  SARS-CoV-2  vaccination  in  humans  elicits  cross-reactive  antibody  against  SARS-CoV-1  and  common  cold  coronavirus  OC43. 

and a paragraph later:

For  example,  vaccination  with  a  SARS-CoV-1  spike  vaccine  confers  robust  protection  against  a  SARS-CoV-2  challenge  (76%  antigen-matched).  On  the  other  hand,  vaccination  with  a  SARS-CoV-2  spike  vaccine  did  not  confer  significant  protection  against  an  OC43  challenge  (only  37% antigen-matched).

Isnt this in opposition to what they write in their abstract?

"The common cold is caused by a lot of different virus families (rhino and adenoviruses, just to name two). Obviously having previously had a cold caused by these two that I mentioned would do nothing to help cause a mild Covid19 infection instead of a serious one.

However,  other  studies  have  shown  contradicting  results[8].  Such  discrepancy can be explained by the heterogeneity of immune histories and pre-existing conditions in humans, which can influence COVID-19 susceptibility, and the  fact  that  those  human  studies  were  retrospective.    Our  study  brings  more  clarity  to  this  issue  of  heterologous  protection  mediated  by  prior  coronavirus  infections [...]

"#Abstract

**Background**

Heterologous prime-boost schedules with vector- and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are already administered, but immunological responses and elicited protection have not been reported.

**Methods**

We here analyzed a cohort of 26 individuals aged 25-46 (median 30.5) years that received a ChAdOx1 nCoV-2019 prime followed by a BNT162b2 boost after an 8-week interval for reactogenicity, antibody responses and T cell reactivity.

**Results**

Self-reported solicited symptoms after ChAdOx1 nCoV-2019 prime were in line with previous reports and less severe after the BNT162b2 boost. Antibody titers increased significantly over time resulting in strong neutralization titers 2 weeks after the BNT162b2 boost. Neutralizing activity against the prevalent strain B.1.1.7 was 3.9-fold higher than in individuals receiving homologous BNT162b2 vaccination, only 2-fold reduced for variant of concern B.1.351, and similar for variant B.1.617. In addition, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells reacted to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide stimulus 2 weeks after the full vaccination.

**Conclusions**

The heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-2019 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination regimen is not associated with serious adverse events and results in a potent humoral immune response and elicits T cell reactivity. Variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617 are potently neutralized by sera of all participants. These results suggest that this heterologous vaccination regimen is at least as immunogenic and protective as homologous vaccinations.",nqfdr6,2021-06-02 07:40:26
"From multiple pieces of evidence, it seems clear that giving any kind of heterologous stimulation to the immune system - natural infection followed by single dose, different vaccines for each dose etc. - has a stronger effect than the same vaccine twice. i.e. AZ-Pfizer showed 3.9-fold *more* neutralising activity against B.1.1.7 than Pfizer-Pfizer here, unchanged for B.1.617 and only a two-fold reduction for B.1.351 (compared to B.1.1.7).

"If a virus spreads through direct contact between cells then antibodies won't be able to attach to any viral surface proteins since antibodies only circulate in the space between cells, and never go inside of cells. That's why we have T cells that can detect what is going on inside of cells and tell cells to terminate if they detect that they're infected.",nqgdw7,2021-06-02 20:25:52

However, I believe that the frequent sequence surveillance in places like the UK allow us to determine whether changes in any of the viral proteins are impacting transmissability and virulence. Therefore, if non-spike mutations cause a change in syncytia formation that meaningfully affects the disease, it should only be a matter of time before they are picked up (even in the absence of specific studies for this effect).",nqgdw7,2021-06-02 22:04:09

"**Abstract**

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants pose a threat to human immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination. We assessed the recognition of three variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) in cohorts of COVID-19 patients ranging in disease severity (n = 69) and recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (n = 50). Spike binding and neutralization against all three VOC was substantially reduced in the majority of samples, with the largest 4-7-fold reduction in neutralization being observed against B.1.351. While hospitalized COVID-19 patients and vaccinees maintained sufficient neutralizing titers against all three VOC, 39% of non-hospitalized patients did not neutralize B.1.351. Moreover, monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) show sharp reductions in their binding kinetics and neutralizing potential to B.1.351 and P.1, but not to B.1.1.7. These data have implications for the degree to which pre-existing immunity can protect against subsequent infection with VOC and informs policy makers of susceptibility to globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOC.",nqfgr4,2021-06-02 07:45:16

">CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 1, 2021-- Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced that it has initiated the rolling submission process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a Biologics License Application (BLA) for the licensure of its mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older.

>“We are pleased to announce this important step in the U.S. regulatory process for a Biologics License Application (BLA) of our COVID-19 vaccine,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We look forward to working with the FDA and will continue to submit data from our Phase 3 study and complete the rolling submission.”

>Moderna will continue to submit data to support the BLA to the FDA on a rolling basis over the coming weeks with a request for a Priority Review. Once the rolling BLA submission is complete, FDA will notify the Company when it is formally accepted for review.",npune6,2021-06-01 14:58:43
so simultaneously applying for full approval in 18+ while seeking EUA for 12-17 (which will be a separate approval down the line?) excellent to see. hopefully pfizer won’t be far behind,npune6,2021-06-01 18:22:22
"Pfizer applied for full approval on May 7

"As a non-American, can I ask what the practical differences are between full approval and EUA?",npune6,2021-06-01 19:04:30
The criteria for EUAare less strict and less time consuming than full approval is. Hydroxychloroquine received an EUA but that was later revoked.,npune6,2021-06-01 19:15:50
EUA is granted in emergencies. It’s when all the safety data is not complete but the benefits outweigh the risks. Full approval is with more solid data and everything from pediatric dosing to geriatric dosing and effects during pregnancy or with kidney failure etc. Full approval takes years.,npune6,2021-06-01 19:20:31
"i’m sure someone else will chime in to correct or expand on this, but i think the single biggest difference is labeling and, potentially, liability. FDA approved drugs/biologics must have extensive documentation for the patient including side effects, interactions, etc.  

further, right now with the EUAs, patients do not have the right to file suit against a manufacturer if they experience even severe side effects/injury. full approval will make manufacturers legally responsible if such events occur (and are proven to be caused by the shot.) i doubt this liability will be retroactive but i don’t know.  

directly related to the liability issue is that, theoretically, employers and schools will be more willing to require vaccination because the shots have the full confidence of the government and liability for injury wouldn’t fall (at least entirely) on the organization mandating the shot, but on the drug companies.",npune6,2021-06-01 19:29:47
The full approval requires six  month follow up of the Phase 3 study participants while the EUA only uses two months.  Long term side effects will show up during the six months since vaccine side effects show up within a couple of months.  The data required for a full approval is rather huge so that is why it will take awhile to gather it and do the analysis.,npune6,2021-06-02 21:00:28
"So, take this with a grain of salt since this isn't my area of expertise. The US has major vaccine hesitancy and refusal issues that are going to prevent it from reaching herd immunity and will make us vulnerable when the B.1.617.2 variant arrives here.

The practical effect of BLA licensure is that more entities (employers, schools, etc) will be willing to require vaccination of students/employees. Some universities have made their fall vaccination requirements contingent on full BLA.  

It is also possible that some vaccine hesitant persons will be more willing to be vaccinated if it is fully approved. Though I think that the ""experimental"" attack from vaccine opponents is largely insincere. They'd shift to something else.",npune6,2021-06-01 21:26:13
"I’m not sure a lot of these answers are correct. from a briefing I saw, the main ”feature” Of a EUA application is that it allows production to start while the phase 2/3 was underway, and allowed the data to be collected in a ”rolling” review rather then have all of the data upfront. 

The data needs to be collected, including the outcomes once the immunizations was given, and a lot more red tape needs to be filled in, but there won’t be any more studies, and the EUAs (at least for the vaccines) was not done with any less data 

The Liability issue is with the contract for the vaccines, not granted on the basis of EUA. The USA basically took the liabilities for the vaccines. The longer time period may make the drug company more willing to take liability, but I would be surprised if that changed.",npune6,2021-06-02 00:19:38
">from pediatric dosing to geriatric dosing and effects during pregnancy or with kidney failure etc.

From my understanding, this is not necessarily true. 

They can limit who it is approved for, i.e. 18+ nonpregnant, with a biologics license (just like EUA). My understanding is that, practically speaking, the difference is 4 months of Phase III follow up.",npune6,2021-06-02 02:28:10
"> It’s when all the safety data is not complete but the benefits outweigh the risks

No the FDA has made it very clear that safety data is still fully completed before EUA. It's effectiveness that is less stringent. If it is safe and looks like it might be useful then EUA, which might get yoinked if it's shown to not be effective. That's what happened to HQC like the other person mentioned, we already have plenty of safety data on that, but it ended up being useless so EUA was removed.",npune6,2021-06-02 14:21:51

"#Abstract

**Background:** Few studies have quantified aerosol concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals and long-term care homes, and fewer still have examined samples for viability. This information is needed to clarify transmission risks beyond close contact.

**Methods:** We deployed particulate air samplers in rooms with COVID-19 positive patients in hospital ward and ICU rooms, rooms in long-term care homes experiencing outbreaks, and a correctional facility experiencing an outbreak. Samplers were placed between 2 and 3 meters from the patient. Aerosol (small liquid particles suspended in air) samples were collected onto gelatin filters by Ultrasonic Personal Air Samplers (UPAS) fitted with <2.5µm (micrometer) and <10µm size-selective inlets operated for 16 hours (total 1.92m3), and with a Coriolis Biosampler over 10 minutes (total 1.5m3). Samples were assayed for viable SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the viral genome by multiplex PCR using the E and N protein target sequences. We validated the sampling methods by inoculating gelatin filters with viable vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and with three concentrations of viable SARS-CoV-2, operating personal samplers for 16hrs, and quantifying viable virus recovery by TCID50 assay. 

**Results:** In total, 138 samples were collected from 99 rooms. RNA samples were positive in 9.1% (6/66) of samples obtained with the UPAS 2.5µm samplers, 13.5% (7/52) with the UPAS 10µm samplers, and 10.0% (2/20) samples obtained with the Coriolis samplers. Culturable virus was not recovered in any samples. Viral RNA was detected in 10.9% of the rooms sampled. There was no significant difference in viral RNA recovery between the different room locations or samplers. Method development experiments indicated minimal loss of SARS-CoV-2 viability via the personal air sampler operation.

**Key Findings:** Although a subset of aerosol samples exhibited detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA at low titres, the presence of viable SARS-CoV-2 virus in aerosols appears to be infrequent at >2m distance.",nqfgzh,2021-06-02 07:46:09
"Super interesting study. None of the samples being culturable is the headline for me. At the very least it means that the protective measures are working in the hospitals where the samples were taken, and possibly that aerosol spread is actually very rare.",nqfgzh,2021-06-02 10:53:35
"From what I understand, measles is widely considered to be airborne, and is known to remain infectious in the air for up to two hours, but it’s been rarely ever cultured from aerosols.

I’m not sure if this counts as a source, but for the time it’s transmissible in air: https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html#transmission",nqfgzh,2021-06-02 21:49:05
"I think it's more a reminder that culturing viruses from the air is difficult. It's impressive that a few groups have managed it with SARS-CoV-2, but the sensitivity of air sample culture as a test for infectious virus should probably be considered rather low.",nqfgzh,2021-06-02 19:18:31

"**Abstract**

Lung inflammation is a hallmark of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in severely ill patients and the pathophysiology of disease is thought to be immune-mediated. Mast cells (MCs) are polyfunctional immune cells present in the airways, where they respond to certain viruses and allergens, often promoting inflammation. We observed widespread degranulation of MCs during acute and unresolved airway inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice and non-human primates. In humans, transcriptional changes in patients requiring oxygen supplementation also implicated cells with a MC phenotype. MC activation in humans was confirmed, through detection of the MC-specific protease, chymase, levels of which were significantly correlated with disease severity. These results support the association of MC activation with severe COVID-19, suggesting potential strategies for intervention.",nqfcn2,2021-06-02 07:38:01

"The Coronavac, applied in 27,1 thousand residents of the municipality, localized in the region of Ribeirão Preto protected vaccinated and non vaccinated, creating a collective “immunological belt” against the virus, reducing drastically its transmission, as revealed by the unprecedented study in the world. 

The immunization of all the adult population of the municipality of Serrana, in the countryside of São Paulo, with the Butantan´s CoronaVac caused a great reduction of 80% of the symptomatic cases and 95% of deaths after the second vaccination of the last group of the city (please see the trust gap in the end of the text). 

This is the main conclusion of the clinical study of effectiveness - named “Project S” - an unprecedented study in the world, coordinated by the Institute that is related to the Government of São Paulo. 

The reduction was stated by the comparison of the data from the beginning of the project until the vaccination of all the groups was completed - with all the trimester evaluated (february, march and april of 2021). 

The results also showed that the vaccination protects not only the adults that received the two doses of the immunization but also the children and teenagers with less than 18 years old who were not vaccinated. 

This proves that the intervention made in the city by Butantan created in it a true “immunological belt” with a collective barrier against the virus, drastically reducing the transmission in the municipality. 

Another important conclusion of the research is the incidence of the disease in Serrana in comparison with the nearby cities. Serrana has around 10 thousand residents that works  in Ribeirão Preto daily. However, while Ribeirão Preto and others cities in the region are presenting high levels of COVID-19 cases, Serrana maintained low taxes if compared to the cities with similar profile, due to the vaccination. 

In other words, the success of the vaccination was confirmed not only by the decrease in the number of infected people but also showed that the residents of Serrana that goes daily from one city to another did not bring a relevant increase in the number of cases. 

Between February 17 and April of this year, during 8 weeks, around 27 thousand residents of the municipality received the completed vaccination scheme: two doses of the Coronavac with a gap of 28 days between the first and second doses. This represents a coverage of approximately 95% of the adult population of residents, according to the health census made previously by Butantan. 

The research, conducted by Butantan Institute and approved by the ethical and sanitary authorities, counted with the partnership of the Medical School of USP in Ribeirão Preto and with the Municipal Government of Serrana. 

The method used for the clinical trial is called stepped-wedge trial. The city was split in 25 sub areas forming four populacional groups, named clusters and identified by colors - green, yellow, gray and blue - which received the immunizing following this order. The vaccine was offered to all residents aged over 18 years eligible to the study in these areas, sequentially and in four degrees. 

The study also concluded that the two last populacional groups participating on the vaccination were already benefiting from the reduction of the transmission of the virus generated by the immunization of the residents of the two first groups. 

The medical director of the clinical research of Butantan Institute, Ricardo Palacios, who also directed the study, explains that the sequential scheduling permits the evaluation of the four vaccinated areas. 

“We understood that the phenomena observed did not happen randomly, but it repeats in the four groups in different moments' ' explains. “The most important result was understanding that we can control the pandemics even without vaccinating all the population. When reaching the coverture of 70 to 75%, the degree in the incidence was detected even in the group that had not completed the vaccination scheme already” completes. 

According to Palacios, the clinical trial also confirmed the indirect effect of the vaccination, since it was possible to prove the protection of populations that were not vaccinated, such as the children. “ The reduction of the cases in people who did not receive the vaccine indicates the degree of the virus circulation. This enforces vaccination as a public health measure and not only an individual action” says the director of the study. 

The municipality of Serrana was chosen to host the project and presents, by the time, a high level of prevalent infections by COVID-19 and by the fact that it has a regional hospital. The goal was to study the epidemiological impact of the vaccination on the adult population group, regarding the contention of the pandemic. 

The vaccine was applied upon the volunteering participation of the residents. People attended to receive the immunizing in previously scheduled dates. 

“The important conclusions of this study can support the strategies of immunization not only in Brazil but throughout the world, and it offers hope in the control of the pandemic with vaccines as the Coronavac, which was developed in partnership of the chinese pharmaceutical Sinovac with Butantan” states the president of the Institute, Dimas Covas. 

According to the scientist and professor, the study of phase 4 proves the efficiency of the vaccine as a collective health strategy. The clinical trials of the phase 3, made between july and december of 2020, had already assured the efficacy of the immunizing, with varying levels between 50,7% to 62,3% to symptomatic cases and from 83,7% to 100% in occurences that demands any medical assistance. 

“The vaccine is secure, effective, efficient, has a high level of quality and contributes to prevent the development of the disease, complications and deaths between the infected. We also know now that it causes beneficial effects in a whole population, protecting the vaccinated, the non vaccinated and significantly reducing the virus circulation.” concludes the president of Butantan.

Is a trial of 196 patients enough? Merck previously tried for an EUA for their drug due to results based off a trial with around 200 patients but the FDA decided to hold off until they received more data.,npttvu,2021-06-01 19:21:33
">RADNOR, Pa., June 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- NRx Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: NRXP) (NRx), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, today announced it has filed an application with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for ZYESAMI™ (Aviptadil-acetate), to treat Critically Ill COVID-19 patients suffering with respiratory failure. Consistent with previously announced top-line data, the study identified a statistically significant increase in the likelihood that patients treated with ZYESAMI™ would be alive and free of respiratory failure at 60 days, compared to those treated with placebo, and identified a significantly shorter median hospital stay.1 The clinical study report filed with FDA further documents statistically significant advantages for ZYESAMI™ on all major secondary endpoints.

>""The patients enrolled in our study were in the ICU, having exhausted all approved treatments for COVID-19,"" said Jonathan Javitt, M.D, MPH, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, of NRx. ""We look forward to working as quickly as possible with the FDA in hopes of providing critically ill patients with a new medicine that will increase their chances of recovery and survival, enabling them to leave the hospital and return to their families significantly sooner.""

>Patients enrolled in the study had respiratory failure despite prior treatment with all approved medicines for COVID-19 including remdesivir. Other therapies administered included steroids, anticoagulants, and various monoclonal antibodies. Although antiviral treatment has shown advantages in treating patients with earlier stages of COVID-19. ZYESAMI™ is the first reported medicine to demonstrate increased recovery and survival in patients who have already progressed to respiratory failure. The randomized controlled trial outcomes remain similarly consistent with the open-label, administratively controlled trial reported in October 2020.2

>""Since this pandemic started, there have been very few medications to effectively treat COVID-19,"" said Dushyantha Jayaweera, MD, Professor of Clinical Medicine and former Associate Dean, University of Miami, who served as Principal Investigator for the COVID-AIV trial. ""The positive results from this trial turned into positive implications for some of our sickest COVID-19 patients and support the clinical benefit of ZYESAMI™ in critically-ill COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. Even today, despite the availability of vaccines, we continue to see severely ill patients suffering with COVID-19, who desperately need new medicines to help them recover.""

"Abstract:

COVID-19 is known to cause immune dysregulation and vitamin D is a known immunomodulator. This study aims to objectively investigate the impact of Pulse D therapy in reducing the inflammatory markers of COVID-19.Consented COVID-19 patients with hypovitaminosis D were evaluated for inflammatory markers (N/L ratio, CRP, LDH, IL6, Ferritin) along with vitamin D on 0th day and 9th/11th day as per their respective BMI category. Subjects were randomised into VD and NVD groups. VD group received Pulse D therapy (targeted daily supplementation of 60,000 IUs of vitamin D for 8 or 10 days depending upon their BMI) in addition to the standard treatment. NVD group received standard treatment alone. Differences in the variables between the two groups were analysed for statistical significance. Eighty seven out of one hundred and thirty subjects have completed the study (VD:44, NVD:43). Vitamin D level has increased from 16 ± 6 ng/ml to 89 ± 32 ng/ml after Pulse D therapy in VD group and highly significant (p < 0.01) reduction of all the measured inflammatory markers was noted. Reduction of markers in NVD group was insignificant (p > 0.05). The difference in the reduction of markers between the groups (NVD vs VD) was highly significant(p < 0.01). Therapeutic improvement in vitamin D to 80–100 ng/ml has significantly reduced the inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19without any side effects. Hence, adjunctive Pulse D therapy can be added safely to the existing treatment protocols of COVID-19 for improved outcomes.",np7n8z,2021-05-31 17:45:56

>Memory B cells (MBC) can provide a recall response able to supplement waning antibodies with an affinity-matured response better able to neutralise variant viruses. We studied a cohort of vulnerable elderly care home residents and younger staff, a high proportion of whom had lost neutralising antibodies (nAb), to investigate their reserve immunity from SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC. Class-switched spike and RBD-tetramer-binding MBC with a classical phenotype persisted five months post-mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of age. Spike/RBD-specific MBC remained detectable in the majority who had lost nAb, although at lower frequencies and with a reduced IgG/IgA isotype ratio. Functional spike/S1/RBD-specific recall was also detectable by ELISpot in some who had lost nAb, but was significantly impaired in the elderly, particularly to RBD. Our findings demonstrate persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC beyond loss of nAb, but highlight the need for careful monitoring of functional defects in RBD-specific B cell immunity in the elderly.",npeymo,2021-05-31 23:23:49

"I haven't seen many head to head comparisons of the mRNA vaccines (most studies combine data for them) so I found the results interesting:  
____
**Results**  
There was a broad distribution of IgG levels among the vaccinated subjects, ranging from 11,455
ng/mL (lowest level) to 167,989 ng/ml (highest level) with geometric mean of 61,203 ng/mL for Pfizer group
and 20,146 ng/ml to 170,270 ng/mL with geometric mean of 92,435 ng/ml for Moderna group. The differences in geometric mean (61,203 vs. 92,435) between two
groups were statistically insignificant.  
  
The neutralizing infectivity of the pseudoviruses was evaluated in sera at dilutions ranging from 1:50 to
1:36,450. We showed that sera from all vaccinated subjects had neutralizing activities and there was no
statistical difference in serum neutralizing activity (ID50) against SARS-CoV-2 WT between two groups
, although the ID50 varied substantially within each group. The Pfizer group
ID50 ranged from 732 to 30,021 with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 6,739, and the Moderna group ID50
ranged from 2,426 to 26,667 with GMT of 9,670.  
  
Although sera from all vaccinated subjects could neutralize the pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins of
variants, neutralizing titers were lower when compared to SARS-CoV-2 WT:  
  
**In Pfizer-vaccinated sera**, there
was a significant decrease of GMTs for D614G (4,649, -1.45 fold), B.1.1.7 (3,058, -2.2 fold), B.1.525 (1,658, -
4.06 fold), and B.1.351 (644, -10.46 fold), respectively.  
  
**In Moderna-vaccinated sera**, although there was a
significant reduction of GMTs for B.1.1.7 (6,525, -1.48 fold), B.1.525 (2,869, -3.37 fold), and B.1.351 (1,279, -
7.56 fold), respectively (Fig. 1B). Among the variants studied, B.1.351 appeared to be the most resistant to the
neutralization by sera from either Pfizer (reduction of 10.46-fold) or Moderna (reduction of 7.56- fold)
groups.   
  
This finding is consistent with and supported by recent reports 5,6. Despite an overall decline in
neutralizing titers (GMTs) against the variants, sera at low dilution (1:50) could neutralize 99% of both SARSCoV-2 WT pseudovirus and the variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.525, and B.1.351) .",npkm47,2021-06-01 04:29:15
"**Abstract**  
Both Pfizer-BNT162b2 and Moderna-mRNA-1273 vaccines can elicit an effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the elicited serum antibody levels vary substantially and longitudinally decrease after vaccination. We examined the correlation of vaccination-induced IgG levels and neutralization titers against newly emerged variants remains and demonstrate a significant reduction of neutralization activities against the variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.525, and B.1.351) in Pfizer or Moderna vaccined sera. There was a significant and positive correlation between serum IgG levels and ID50 titers for not only SARS-CoV-2 WT but also the variants. These findings indicate that a high level of anti-spike IgG may offer better protection against infection from SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Therefore, it is necessary to longitudinally monitor specific serum IgG level for evaluating the protective efficacy of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants.",npkm47,2021-06-01 04:26:26

"It seems odd to me that a 30,000 ng/mL difference in GMT between the two is labeled “statistically insignificant” on the scale given. Can somebody weigh in on why that would be? Even though both vaccines seem to be working approximately the same as of now, isn’t it possible that that difference could lead to longer durability and/or being able to stand up better against certain variants?",npkm47,2021-06-01 15:53:19
"It looks like the variance for the sample is very large. Though the difference might be practically significant among a population, for the sample size, it's not statistically significant.",npkm47,2021-06-01 17:28:30

"Correct.
You can't be confident that the mean from your sample is representative of the mean of your intended target population. That confidence comes from the sample variance (the response to response consistency).",npkm47,2021-06-01 22:38:42

">**Abstract**

>A recent study proposed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hijacks the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition machinery to integrate into the DNA of infected cells. If confirmed, this finding could have significant clinical implications. Here, we applied deep (>50x) long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to HEK293T cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and did not find any evidence of the virus existing as DNA. By examining ONT data from separate HEK293T cultivars, we resolved the complete sequences of 78 L1 insertions arising in vitro in the absence of L1 overexpression systems. ONT sequencing applied to hepatitis B virus (HBV) positive liver cancer tissues located a single HBV insertion. These experiments demonstrate reliable resolution of retrotransposon and exogenous virus insertions via ONT sequencing. That we found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 integration suggests such events in vivo are highly unlikely to drive later oncogenesis or explain post-recovery detection of the virus.",np14j7,2021-05-31 12:23:11

"#Abstract

**Background**

The sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pulmonary structure and function remain incompletely characterized.

**Methods**

Adults with confirmed COVID-19 who remained symptomatic more than thirty days following diagnosis were enrolled and classified as ambulatory, hospitalized or requiring the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the highest level of care received during acute infection. Symptoms, pulmonary function tests and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were compared across groups and to healthy controls. CT images were quantitatively analyzed using supervised machine-learning to measure regional ground glass opacities (GGO) and image-matching to measure regional air trapping. Comparisons were performed using univariate analyses and multivariate linear regression.

**Results**

Of the 100 patients enrolled, 67 were in the ambulatory group. All groups commonly reported cough and dyspnea. Pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive physiology in the hospitalized and ICU groups but was normal in the ambulatory group. Among hospitalized and ICU patients, the mean percent of total lung classified as GGO was 13.2% and 28.7%, respectively, and was higher than in ambulatory patients (3.7%, P<0.001). The mean percentage of total lung affected by air trapping was 25.4%, 34.5% and 27.2% in the ambulatory, hospitalized and ICU groups and 7.3% in healthy controls (P<0.001). Air trapping measured by quantitative CT correlated with the residual volume to total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC; ρ =0.6, P<0.001).

**Conclusions**

Air trapping is present in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and is independent of initial infection severity, suggesting obstruction at the level of the small airways. The long-term consequences are not known.",noyzwm,2021-05-31 10:06:36
"The method is interesting (machine learning), but we already know about GGOs. What we need to know is the rate of healing, and if there is residual damage that never heals.

This study would be more useful if they followed the group over a period of time. They should do CT and PFT every three months and track the progress of recovery.",noyzwm,2021-05-31 16:46:35

"#Abstract

**Objectives**

Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have been introduced. To investigate whether the vaccine provides protective immunity effectively, the amount and function of vaccine-induced antibodies were evaluated.

**Methods**

Sera from 13-17 days after the second dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine were collected from healthcare workers at the University of Toyama (n=740). Antibody levels were quantitatively measured by the anti-receptor binding domain antibody test (anti-RBD test), and neutralising activity against pseudotyped viruses displaying wild-type (WT) and mutant spike proteins (B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-derived variants) were assayed using a high-throughput chemiluminescent reduction neutralising test (htCRNT). Basic clinical characteristics were obtained from questionnaires.

**Results**

Antibodies were confirmed in all participants in both the anti-RBD test (median 2112 U/mL, interquartile range [IQR] 1275-3390 U/mL) and the htCRNT against WT (median % inhibition >99.9, IQR >99.9 to >99.9). For randomly selected sera (n=61), 100.0% were positive for htCRNT against the B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-derived variants. Among those who answered the questionnaire (n=237), the values of the anti-RBD test were negatively correlated with age for females (p<0.01; r = -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.45 to -0.16). Systemic symptoms after vaccination were related to higher values of the anti-RBD test (median 2425, IQR 1450 - 3933 vs. median 1347, IQR 818 - 2125 for no symptoms; p<0.01).

**Conclusions**

The BNT162b2 vaccine produced sufficient antibodies in terms of quality and quantity which could neutralise emerging variants. Antibody induction can be affected by age and sex but will still be at a sufficient level.",noyy1m,2021-05-31 10:03:15

"#Abstract

**Background:** Since its first identification in the United Kingdom in late 2020, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, become dominant in several European countries raising great concern.

**Aim:** The aim of this study was to develop a duplex real-time RT-qPCR assay to detect, discriminate and quantitate SARS-CoV-2 variants containing one of its mutation signatures, the HV69/70 deletion, to trace the community circulation of the B.1.1.7 variant in Spain through the Spanish National SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance System (VATar COVID-19).

**Results:** B.1.1.7 variant was first detected in sewage from the Southern city of Malaga (Andalucia) in week 20_52, and multiple introductions during Christmas holidays were inferred in different parts of the country, earlier than clinical epidemiological reporting by the local authorities. Wastewater-based B.1.1.7 tracking showed a good correlation with clinical data and provided information at the local level. Data from WWTPs which reached B.1.1.7 prevalences higher than 90% for at least 2 consecutive weeks showed that 8.1+/-1.8 weeks were required for B.1.1.7 to become dominant.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the applicability of RT-qPCR-based strategies to track specific mutations of variants of concern (VOCs) as soon as they are identified by clinical sequencing, and its integration into existing wastewater surveillance programs, as a cost-effective approach to complement clinical testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.",noyyvc,2021-05-31 10:04:39

The title is disappointingly misleading considering the journal, read the text carefully. As previously mentioned by another commenter antibodies does not necessarily equal 100% immunity. 

In the last paragraph they do note the mutations as additional factor. But it isn't *just* about the mutations. Even though the antibodies (technically corresponding memory cells) that persist tend to be the more potent of the initial plasmablast response, overall protective immunity tends to diminish over time and how that works with this virus is not very clear yet because it's so new. In fact it would be a bit surprising if they could not detect any memory cells at all in the timeframes they tested but level of protection  in the mid (12-18 mo after infection) and long term it is still not clear and we certainly cannot talk about lifetime protection (with effectiveness that approaches that inferred at 1-4 months after vaccination/infection) with the data at hand.",nnusnt,2021-05-29 21:46:03

"My understanding is that memory cells confer protective immunity, so that if you are re-exposed to the pathogen, your body knows how to fight it, and (theoretically) you would have a shorter and lighter disease course, if you got sick at all. 

Vaccines OTOH create *sterilizing* immunity, a high and constant antibody titer that quickly eliminates the virus as soon as it gets in your body. Which also means it's very unlikely to spread (important for getting the pandemic under control).

Both natural and vaccinated immunity exist. Epidemiologists talk about both equally as factors in modeling ""herd immunity."" The whole point of vaccination is to create that immunity *without* the risks of infection, but if you already got infected, you essentially already got a sort of ""vaccination.""

The benefit of vax is just a higher and more uniform degree of sterilizing immunity, while the immunity from infection is more variable and unpredictable. There is no telling at this point which lasts longer, or which is more successful against variants. SARS 1 (the closest relative) seemed to create strong and persistent immunity. 

I get the social reasons for why people are downplaying natural immunity, but the basics of immunology still apply right? If you mounted an adaptive immune response (regardless of current antibodies) then your body ""learned"" how to fight this particular bug, and you have achieved the same effect of vaccination. We're not *supposed* to be walking around with high levels of antibodies all the time, we're just supposed to be able to summon them when we need them.

>The distinction is important because many people do not realize that vaccines primarily prevent the disease but not necessarily infection. That means not all vaccines block fully vaccinated people from transmitting the pathogen to others.  
>  
>“The holy grail of vaccine development always is to stop people from ever getting infected, but it is monumentally difficult to get that,” says Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of virology at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. That holy grail is called sterilizing immunity, completely protecting a person from disease as well as stopping the microbe from getting into cells in the first place, he says.

Achieving sterilizing immunity is particularly difficult for a respiratory disease because conventional vaccines induce primarily IgG in the bloodstream rather than IgA in the nasal secretions and saliva. This means that some cells in the nose/mouth/throat could be infected before the IgG antibodies are able to put out the infection. Future intranasal vaccines could be better at inducing sterilizing immunity.

"Neither previous infection nor vaccines provide sterilising immunity to many people in the short to mid term (6-12 months) and we know even less about longer periods and there is variation from person to person as well. It isn't about having or not having antibodies, how much and with what kind of potency matters as well, and there are mutations to worry about on top of everything. What you describe is very simplistic but really it is science communication (and everyone responsible for it) that has failed.

"Okay, but the entire operation of “defeating” the pandemic depends on understanding what lasting immunity looks like and how we achieve it.

The vaccines aren’t a “guess” - we know they confer strong immunity for X months, and we infer that they also create memory cell responses. Ditto for natural immunity.

I know the exact timelines won’t be known until after the fact, but there is nothing magical about SARS COV2 that would make it act dramatically different from other viruses, and this matches recent observations of post-COVID immune response.

I was being general and simplistic but the point is that vaccination creates that high level of antibodies, and even augments the immunity created by a previous infection.

"> but the entire operation of “defeating” the pandemic depends on understanding what lasting immunity looks like and how we achieve it.

Agreed. That wasn't a point I made. 

> The vaccines aren’t a “guess”

Strawman. I never said such. I said speculation regarding long term immunity is akin to guessing because we have no idea what the immune profile of someone who becomes reinfected looks like. There's just not enough data. I took immunology courses, I know what the immune cascade looks like for specific immunity. I also know from reviewing the literature and hearing immunologists speak is that they don't really have a strong understanding of what would be necessary to have sterilizing or lasting immunity. 

>It’s a good thing that we can lasting create immunity against this virus.

Again, you're saying something no one is arguing against. Of course it's a good thing we can create lasting immunity. We know as a fact that common betacorona viruses can reinfect people. What percentage of people? We can't say because we don't do challenge trials with these viruses and we don't have good data. We do know it's endemic so that gives us a low end of reinfection potential for it to stick around so long.

> I don’t get why people try to resist or downplay the idea.

What is harmful is not managing the expectations of people who will take what high profile articles say as word and then when it turns out to be false. That results in an erosion of public trust in modern science which is something we are now all deeply familiar with.

"Abstract

Fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) energize the COVID-19 pandemic. B.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/01) has become the predominant variant in many countries and a new lineage (VOC-202102/02) harboring the E484K escape mutation in the B.1.1.7 background emerged in February 2021. This variant is of concern due to reduced neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies. However, it is not known whether this single amino acid change leads to an altered immune response. Here, we investigate differences in the immune transcriptome in hospitalized patients infected with either B.1.1.7 (n=28) or B.1.1.7+E484K (n=12). RNA-seq conducted on PBMCs isolated within five days after the onset of COVID symptoms demonstrated elevated activation of specific immune pathways, including JAK-STAT signaling, in B.1.1.7+E484K patients as compared to B.1.1.7. Longitudinal transcriptome studies demonstrated a delayed dampening of interferon-activated pathways in B.1.1.7+E484K patients. Prior vaccination with BNT162b vaccine (n=8 one dose; n=1 two doses) reduced the transcriptome inflammatory response to B.1.1.7+E484K infection relative to unvaccinated patients. Lastly, the immune transcriptome of patients infected with additional variants (B.1.258, B.1.1.163 and B.1.7.7) displayed a reduced activation compared to patients infected with B.1.1.7. Acquisition of the E484K substitution in the B.1.1.7 background elicits an altered immune response, which could impact disease progression.",no8kmd,2021-05-30 12:04:07

All respondents received two doses of CoronaVac vaccine at 14-days interval.

Seropositive survivors were rapidly boosted after first dose with higher antibody titer than non-survivors and seronegative survivors after second dose. However, antibody titer did not differ between first and second dose among seropositive survivors.

"Abstract
Purpose
To quantify COVID-19 recurrence among clinical and nonclinical healthcare employees with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies or prior COVID-19 infection.

Methods
This prospective, cohort study collected and resulted SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples as positive or negative from June 8 to July 10, 2020 from a convenience sample of 16,233 adult participants employed by a large Midwestern healthcare system. Documented positive polymerase chain reaction test results representing COVID-19 infections were recorded up to four months prior to and post-IgG testing.

Results
Nine hundred and thirteen (6.12%) participants, including 45 (4.93%) IgG positive participants, experienced COVID-19 infections after study initiation, representing a 51% increased risk of COVID-19 infection among IgG positive participants (IRR = 1.51). Regressions adjusted for documented disparities showed no difference in COVID-19 infection by IgG status (OR=1.19; P = .3117) but significantly greater odds in COVID-19 recurrence among participants with a prior documented COVID-19 infection (OR=1.93; P < .0001).

Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and prior COVID-19 infection do not appear to offer meaningful protection against COVID-19 recurrence in healthcare workers. Recurrence would impact decisions regarding ongoing healthcare resource utilization. This study can inform considerations for vaccine administration to vulnerable groups.",nnimiz,2021-05-29 10:34:16

“Vaccine Non-Responders

A hepatitis B vaccine “non-responder"" refers to a person who does not develop protective surface antibodies after completing two full series of the hepatitis B vaccine and for whom an acute or chronic hepatitis B infection has been ruled out.

Although the majority of persons vaccinated against hepatitis B successfully respond to vaccination, an estimated 5-15% of persons may not respond due to older age, obesity, smoking, and other chronic illness. “

That might be why we don't see ""Janssen"" referenced as much.

This sort of team-up isn't that unusual.

They've reduced their order from 30 million to 20 million doses so it's only ever going to be a minority thing in the UK. Even though the other orders (including Pfizer and Novavax) would be enough to give everyone in the country a third dose, the volume of vaccines available before winter would make this a useful addition if they decided all those in the highest risk groups needed a booster at e.g. 6 months after the 2nd dose.

This is overall. Rates are higher in younger age groups and higher in women than men. I would presume it has been older people making up the bulk of those vaccinated with AZ so far. I haven't been able to find rates per million vaccinated broken down into the various demographic groups, only the absolute numbers.

Given younger people and women are less likely to experience serious covid outcomes the risk/ benefit analysis is a bit more nuanced than a headline figure of 13 per million.

">GAITHERSBURG, Md., May 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altimmune, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced new results from a preclinical study demonstrating the ability of its AdCOVID vaccine candidate to neutralize the rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant of concern that originated in South Africa. B.1.351 carries multiple mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) including the E484K mutation that has been shown to substantially decrease the ability of authorized vaccines to neutralize the virus.

>In the current study, performed in collaboration with investigators at Saint Louis University, the neutralizing titer against the B.1.351 variant virus was only 4.4-fold lower than the neutralizing titer against an original or ancestral Wuhan-like isolate when measured seven weeks after a single intranasal dose of AdCOVID. Furthermore, in mice that received a booster dose of AdCOVID, the reduction in the neutralizing titer against the B.1.351 variant was only 1.8-fold lower at seven weeks post vaccination; statistically the same as the neutralization titer against the Wuhan isolate. The serum neutralizing antibody titers were determined using a live virus focus reduction neutralization titer (FRNT) assay with a 50% neutralization endpoint.

>“These data are impressive considering the B.1.351 variant has been consistently difficult to neutralize following vaccination with the original prototype vaccines,” said James Brien, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Saint Louis University. “If the simple addition of an AdCOVID booster dose is able to provide effective coverage against variants of concern it would greatly simplify our response to the challenge presented by this virus by eliminating the need to develop new variant adapted vaccines.”

>Importantly, AdCOVID also promoted a strong mucosal neutralizing response to the B.1.351 virus in the respiratory tract with bronchoalveolar lavages showing neutralization of the variant virus. These preclinical data suggest that vaccination with AdCOVID leads to a cross-neutralizing antibody response both systemically and locally within the respiratory tract that can effectively neutralize the B.1.351 virus.

>“We believe that our selection of the RBD of the spike protein as the vaccine antigen was key in obtaining these impressive results,” said Scot Roberts, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Altimmune. “From a neutralization perspective, AdCOVID is designed to focus the immune response on RBD, the most important part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The likely result is the development of antibodies to sub-dominant or cryptic neutralizing epitopes not readily recognized when presented in the context of the entire spike protein, which is targeted by most other vaccine candidates.”",nnb1at,2021-05-29 01:00:20

"Abstract

The northern state of Amazonas is among the regions in Brazil most heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and has experienced two exponentially growing waves, in early and late 2020. Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide.",nnb4he,2021-06-01 12:57:20

"**Abstract**  
____
**Objectives:** To estimate the effectiveness of one and two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes.  
  

**Design:** Using a test-negative design study and linked laboratory, vaccination, and health administrative databases, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) using multivariable logistic regression. Setting: Ontario, Canada between 14 December 2020 and 19 April 2021. Participants: Community-dwelling adults aged ≥16 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and had COVID-19 symptoms. Interventions: Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine. Main outcome measures: Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 identified by RT-PCR; hospitalization or death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
  

**Results:** Among 324,033 symptomatic individuals, 53,270 (16.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 21,272 (6.6%) received 1 or more vaccine dose. Among test-positive cases, 2,479 (4.7%) had a severe outcome. aVE against symptomatic infection 14 days or more after receiving only 1 dose was 60% (95%CI, 57 to 64%), increasing from 48% (95%CI, 41 to 54%) at 14-20 days after the first dose to 71% (95%CI, 63 to 78%) at 35-41 days. aVE 7 days or more after receiving 2 doses was 91% (95%CI, 89 to 93%). Against severe outcomes, aVE 14 days or more after receiving 1 dose was 70% (95%CI, 60 to 77%), increasing from 62% (95%CI, 44 to 75%) at 14-20 days to 91% (95%CI, 73 to 97%) at 35 days or more, whereas aVE 7 days or more after receiving 2 doses was 98% (95%CI, 88 to 100%). For adults aged 70 years and older, aVE estimates were lower after receiving 1 dose, but were comparable to younger adults after 28 days. After 2 doses, we observed high aVE against E484K-positive variants.  
  
**Conclusions:** Two doses of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines are highly effective against both symptomatic infection and severe outcomes. Effectiveness is lower after only a single dose, particularly for older adults shortly after the first dose.",nmxd65,2021-05-28 14:03:51

"> We observed a 16% increase in risk of symptomatic infection 7-13 days after a first dose (aVE -16%; 95%CI, -26% to -6%).

Obviously, this has to be from increased risk-taking due to having gotten the vaccine, or due to some data artifact. It should warn against too quickly adopting a causal interpretation of this sort of observational study.

They give exposure at vaccination clinics or while travelling to them as another possible reason, but it sounds less plausible to me in terms of generating such a big effect:

> The increased risk of infection 7-13 days after receiving the vaccine could be due to an increase in SARS-CoV-2 exposures shortly prior to, during, or after vaccination. Individuals […] may be exposed due to inadequate infection prevention and control measures at (or when travelling to/from) vaccination clinics, or they may assume protection immediately following vaccination and engage in higher risk behaviours before a sufficient immune response has developed. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures in vaccination clinics and examine the potential role of behavioural changes post first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.",nmxd65,2021-05-29 16:20:11

"The single dose efficacy has been all over the place, depending on the study and where/when the data was obtained from, but nonetheless it does look promising that a single-dose is at least somewhat protective. I think it suggests the one-dose strategy employed in Canada will continue to work reasonably well even in light of these VOCs.

I'm more encouraged by the aVE in the 16-39 and 40-69 age groups against severe outcomes. It would suggest that once the 70+ age group has received both doses, easing of restrictions shouldn't incur too much strain on the healthcare system, even before everyone else in the younger crowds has received their second dose.",nmxd65,2021-05-28 22:00:46
"They're using data from people who had COVID-19 symptoms and went for testing, and then comparing rates of COVID-19 positivity between vaccinated versus unvaccinated to estimate vaccine efficacy.

"A result like this has come up again and again in the data, and I don't really see why a behavioral explanation is always postulated, rather than a biological one. It seems a little silly to think that people assume they're protected when the messaging about this has been clear.

"**Background**  
Evidence suggests a role for excessive inflammation in COVID-19 complications. Colchicine is an oral anti-inflammatory medication beneficial in gout, pericarditis, and coronary disease. We aimed to investigate the effect of colchicine on the composite of COVID-19-related death or hospital admission.

  
**Methods**  
The present study is a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, adaptive, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. The study was done in Brazil, Canada, Greece, South Africa, Spain, and the USA, and was led by the Montreal Heart Institute. Patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR testing or clinical criteria who were not being treated in hospital were eligible if they were at least 40 years old and had at least one high-risk characteristic. The randomisation list was computer-generated by an unmasked biostatistician, and masked randomisation was centralised and done electronically through an automated interactive web-response system. The allocation sequence was unstratified and used a 1:1 ratio with a blocking schema and block sizes of six. Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally administered colchicine (0·5 mg twice per day for 3 days and then once per day for 27 days thereafter) or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospital admission for COVID-19. Vital status at the end of the study was available for 97·9% of patients. The analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The COLCORONA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04322682) and is now closed to new participants.

  
**Findings**  
Trial enrolment began in March 23, 2020, and was completed in Dec 22, 2020. A total of 4488 patients (53·9% women; median age 54·0 years, IQR 47·0–61·0) were enrolled and 2235 patients were randomly assigned to colchicine and 2253 to placebo. The primary endpoint occurred in 104 (4·7%) of 2235 patients in the colchicine group and 131 (5·8%) of 2253 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio \[OR\] 0·79, 95·1% CI 0·61–1·03; p=0·081). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 96 (4·6%) of 2075 patients in the colchicine group and 126 (6·0%) of 2084 patients in the placebo group (OR 0·75, 0·57–0·99; p=0·042). Serious adverse events were reported in 108 (4·9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 139 (6·3%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0·051); pneumonia occurred in 63 (2·9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 92 (4·1%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0·021). Diarrhoea was reported in 300 (13·7%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 161 (7·3%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p<0·0001).

  
**Interpretation**  
In community-treated patients including those without a mandatory diagnostic test, the effect of colchicine on COVID-19-related clinical events was not statistically significant. Among patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo. Given the absence of orally administered therapies to prevent COVID-19 complications in community-treated patients and the benefit of colchicine in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, this safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent could be considered for use in those at risk of complications. Notwithstanding these considerations, replication in other studies of PCR-positive community-treated patients is recommended.",nn3ymk,2021-05-28 19:16:42

"Table 4 is quite interesting.  They assess P values for the growth rate of each VUI/VOC relative to B.1.1.7.  Looks like each of these almost certainly (many of these p values are less than 10^-10 ) has a different growth rate than B.1.1.7.

P.1. and B.1.617.1  are both measured as ~33% higher growth rate per week, while B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 both have ~100% higher growth rate per week.  Even B.1.351, [measured](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m9netk/sarscov2_variants_of_concern_are_associated_with/) elsewhere with significantly less growth rate than B.1.1.7, is outpacing B.1.1.7 by 16% per week.  

Note that there's no way to distinguish contagiousness versus immune escape here. With much of the UK having had a single dose (only) of vaccine, it's a likely bet that these differences are due to small differences in immune escape.  The potential for previously infected or weakly vaccinated people to spread these lineages should not be underestimated.

Opinion: we need multivalent vaccines, and with mRNA there's no reason we aren't using them already as first and second doses.",nmzjsg,2021-05-28 18:16:05

"It’s a bit like asking why people with seismic geographic data are more likely to strike oil. 

The UK as a smaller country with dense population as well as a very diverse country with easing travel restrictions (and deep ties to India and more of her former colonies) so tons of people from places with a ton of people getting sick are more apt to travel through there than say, Japan. 

Also, in India and Brazil there are massive amounts of transmission and illness but most people aren’t making it into hospitals except those who are dying. This means the vast majority of people never get tested or enter a system where testing genomes of a virus is possible. 

London has all of this and a robust health care system tied together pretty cleanly. I’d expect to see most variants found there first. Tracing them backwards is going to be the ‘fun’ part.",nmzjsg,2021-05-28 22:21:54

"That we haven't seen this anywhere outside of the UK (and a few states in India, maybe) is pretty strange and begs an explanation.  Since spread of COVID is incredibly heterogeneous it's very hard to rule out pure luck in any lineage becoming dominant once.   We've seen this happen before with B.1.1.7 and P.1, and those turned out to be substantially more contagious than previous lineages.  But we've also seen it with many other lineages where it did turn out to just be luck.

But the UK does not seem to think that's the case.  In six weeks (roughly, assuming a flat 2,000 cases/day during that period) they went from 1900 B.1.1.7 cases + 100 B.1.617.2 cases per day to something like 800 B.1.1.7 and 1200 B.1.617.2.  That runs up through the beginning of the [May 17 time interval at covariants](https://covariants.org/per-country).  No other country (that has sequencing) yet has enough B.1.617.2 prevalence for a comparison to know if this is a one-off or something that's going to happen everywhere, or in many places.   Lack of sterilizing immunity from weak vaccination or previous infection is one possibility to explain the UK's numbers, but not a happy one.

One would have hoped two weeks ago that the next (past) two weeks would show it's just a fluke, but that hasn't happened.

One may still hope for it over the next two weeks, as we watch what happens in countries (that have sequencing) where B.1.617.2 is present in significant (>1%) prevalence. In all of these countries it does not seem clear whether it's growing in absolute prevalence.  Japan, South Africa, the US, and Israel seem to qualify and are at different points along in vaccination.  And, indeed, the next two weeks should show whether cases start skyrocketing in the UK, or if they can prevent them with vaccinations (unbelievably, they still haven't started first doses for people under 30, which could explain unabated spread all by itself in some circumstances).",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 10:10:55
"Hasn't P.1 and B.1.617.2 both had rapid growth in the US as well? And b.1.351 had some small amount of growth over the last few months (although so has 117, so that might not surpass 117's growth for the data we have. )",nmzjsg,2021-05-30 15:19:00
"What I see is that even a small degree of immune escape, even what we have from P.1/B.1.617.2, can give a large reproductive advantage.  This may go away once people are ""highly vaccinated"", but that's a long way off.  And then it may come back once sterilizing immunity wanes.  But if we could improve the level of immunity from vaccination across the board we could drop reproductive rates - across the board.

> variants with the ability to escape current vaccines

This is not a binary ""ability"".  Even the difference between 80% and 85% sterilizing immunity increases reproductive rates among the vaccinated by 1/3.  The difference between 90% and 95% doubles it.  (We have no ability to measure sterilizing immunity, but I assume the latter is close to reality.)

> were starting to see the pitfalls of a one dose strategy, which was always a risky bet.

A single-dose strategy would have been equally risky, though.  What makes B.1.617.2 different than other lineages is that vaccine efficacy after two doses is more than twice as high as the efficacy after one.  A single-dose strategy would face risk from a different variant (namely B.1.1.7) where the opposite is true.  But if multivalent vaccines gave 70%+ efficacy with a single dose against all lineages, this problem would simply go away and the world could be vaccinated (nearly) twice as quickly.",nmzjsg,2021-05-28 21:42:45
"Throw in the fact UK do half the world's sequencing on top, it's a perfect storm",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 01:08:30
"Thanks for the extensive answer. The matter of sequencing is a huge issue - to my understanding, the UK is at the forefront of that. So 2 weeks further in the UK is the most likely source of further insight. Even Germany does not have anything similar to the capabilities of the UK. As for vaccinations: except for the US and Israel, the UK seems to have the lead, by far, in terms of vaccinations. The big difference, however, with continental Europe is the “one shot” policy, whereas Germany and the Netherlands (where I have data) are more or less sticking to EMA guidelines - max 12 weeks for AZ and 3-5 weeks for Pfizer. That, however, means that NL is this week only starting with the age group 51 and older....",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 13:24:18
"The reality is that a “small amount of immune escape” is not very relevant. The last efficacy data we have indicates the AstraZeneca vaccine to have 66% efficacy after two doses against B.1.1.7. Even with that efficacy rating it has result in a dramatic reduction in deaths, cases and a gradual return to normal life for the UK. With the exception of B.1.135, no other variant has been shown to evade vaccine induced immunity in any meaningful way. You’re overthinking things.

And that’s what I said, a single dose strategy was always a risky bet.",nmzjsg,2021-05-28 21:46:54
"Jesus, HALF!? I assumed they would do more than most but wow.",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 05:03:40
"> And that’s what I said, a single dose strategy was always a risky bet.

But it was demonstrably the right one, since the UK largely ended the pandemic with it.  Doing the opposite would have been far worse with B.1.1.7 at full prevalence in the country.

But you're definitely underthinking this.  The problem with B.1.617.2 isn't that vaccines (even a single dose) or previous infection doesn't give protective immunity.  It's that they don't give enough sterilizing immunity to keep reproductive rates below 1, so you have a disease spreading among the vaccinated but with a really low overall CFR.  But for the part of the population that isn't vaccinated at all, CFR is not reduced.  Had they given everyone a first dose, CFR would presumably be even closer to zero and the disease could simply be ignored.  But with 40% of the population completely unvaccinated they aren't at that point.

...but had they been able to use a multivalent vaccine this simply wouldn't be a problem.  One dose would have ended the pandemic entirely.",nmzjsg,2021-05-28 22:16:02
"[Nope, not joking](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-FO998_UKGENO_4U_20210129115155.png). Can't find more recent data but given the fall in cases meaning that we have the capability to sequence more tests than people that test positive, I would imagine that the % of global sequencing we do has fell. The US has also really upped their game.",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 10:04:39
"Studies have indicated that even in breakthrough vaccination cases, viral load is significantly reduced (even in the case of the AZ vaccine) and the propensity for transmitting the virus is greatly reduced. Given that protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection is high after a two dose regiment against B1.167, you can expect a very great reduction in transmission. You *are* overthinking this.",nmzjsg,2021-05-28 22:18:51
"Not a huge fall inc ases tho - we're only down 25% off peak right now (600k new a day vs 800k new a day) but it's all happening in non-western countries so sadly, i also expect sequencing to slow. :-/",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 23:11:22
"Sterilizing immunity is substantially higher than standard ""efficacy against symptomatic infection"" values.  But if it's 99% for mRNA vaccines normally (made up number, but we might have something like 94% reduction in infections and 90% reduction in viral load when infected) and drops to only 90-95% for the highest escape variants we have, that's very significant: it means the risk is raised six-fold.

As an example, https://covid.viz.sg/ appears to visualize traced transmissions in all of Singapore.  Something like 3% of them in the latest (presumably B.1.617.2) outbreak appear to be *between* vaccinated people, and there are multiple instances of transmissions between vaccinated people before an unvaccinated person is infected.  In a world where we want to protect the unvaccinated, that's far from ideal.  It may be good enough with enough vaccinations, but why should we settle for that when we have the ability to simply change some code and fix it?",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 02:36:10
"The current Singapore outbreak is definitely worth studying but it's worth pointing out that if you remove the Changi airport cluster then you start to see much lower onward transmission between vaccinated people.

For example look at the cluster of 60 labeled 'JEM' and you see only 6 vaccinated out of 62 in the cluster and all 6 have no onward transmission.

So the deal with Changi is that Singapore vaccinated all frontliners first and that included airport staff so there's likely selection bias in that we're only seeing the people here at the start of the cluster for whom the vaccine was not effective.",nmzjsg,2021-05-30 02:47:07
"It’s not easy as you’re making it out to be to develop a total coverage multivalent vaccine

We shouldnt be protecting the unvaccinated after vaccines are widely available",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 04:32:34
"B.1.351 gives better antibodies against other lineages than any other spike protein.  Moderna has both B.1.351 (""351"") and B.1.351+B.1 multivalent (""211"") vaccines in phase 1 trials, though since this is a trivial adjustment to an existing vaccine it shouldn't require major efficacy trials.  The B.1.351 booster increased antibody neutralization substantially more than a B.1 booster did.  Pfizer/BNT hasn't announced as much, but they certainly also have B.1.351 vaccines.  With mRNA vaccines this is as simple as changing the code in the production line.

> We shouldnt be protecting the unvaccinated after vaccines are widely available

Would you still have that opinion if we had a lineage that was contagious or leaky enough to infect all the unvaccinated, including all children, once we return to normal?  What if the reproductive rate was enough to cause hospital overload (it would be hard for any R>1 value not to be)?

There is an absolute, and very high in a vaccuum, value to preventing infections.",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 05:16:48
"Yes, I would have that opinion. Children will be able to get vaccinated in the very near future. There is no reason to be protecting those who are willfully avoiding an effective form of protection once it is widely available. And if we’re considering children, this coronavirus does not cause severe enough illness anywhere near frequently enough to cause any kind if hospital overload of transmission is almost exclusively occurring among children.

And your data is incorrect, and you should be more familiar with it before sprouting off comments. Moderna’s B1.351 specific vaccine was less effective against the wild type virus than their current formulation. Their dual vaccine was overall the most effective both against the wild type and B1.351. That “multivalent” vaccine is simply a vaccine covering a potential subset of variants. It is not a universal vaccine, and still falls prey to having to be reformulated in the future.

Please stop arguing this. It’s getting tiring.",nmzjsg,2021-05-29 06:23:37

"**Abstract**  
The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage emerged in October 2020 in India. It has since then become dominant in some indian regions and further spread to many countries. The lineage includes three main subtypes (B1.617.1, B.1617.2 and B.1.617.3), which harbour diverse Spike mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) which may increase their immune evasion potential. B.1.617.2 is believed to spread faster than the other versions. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.617.2 from a traveller returning from India. We examined its sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to antibodies present in sera from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, in comparison to other viral lineages. B.1.617.2 was resistant to neutralization by some anti-NTD and anti-RBD mAbs, including Bamlanivimab, which were impaired in binding to the B.1.617.2 Spike. **Sera from convalescent patients collected up to 12 months post symptoms and from Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine recipients were 3 to 6 fold less potent against B.1.617.2, relative to B.1.1.7.**  
  
**Sera from individuals having received one dose of AstraZeneca Vaxzevria barely inhibited B.1.617.2.** Thus, B.1.617.2 spread is associated with an escape to antibodies targeting non-RBD and RBD Spike epitopes.",nmo97i,2021-05-28 04:01:56

Bad: AstraZeneca vaccine vs. B.1.617.2 yields same results with B.1.351. So mild to moderate Disease seems to be possible. Is there already a study analyzing if severe disease also is possible with AZ vs. B.1.351 (and thus possibly also B.1.617.2)?,nmo97i,2021-05-28 10:12:19

That's probably part of it.  The other part is that the immune system tends to produce more effective antibodies (which are better at binding/neutralizing the virus) on the second exposure.  This is called affinity maturation and it's a result of the immune system adapting over the time only produce the most effective antibodies.,nmo97i,2021-05-28 21:34:11

"Types of ventilators are covered in the other comment; as to whether it can provide enough pressure: it depends.  

With compliant lungs, yes, you can provide enough air movement to breath for someone.  You will see this for patients who have a tight mask they use with a vent, often as outpatients.

 If the lungs are stiff though, such as in the ICU with pneumonia, you generally can't get a tight enough seal to allow the pressure needed to expand the lungs.

Instead you need a tube in the trachea where it is easier to make a seal, plus higher pressures.

The most common one for outpatient clinical use is the Trilogy; I tried to find a decent article but mostly found medical device companies.  Still, it looks accurate and adds some comparisons vs CPAP and BIPAP, which may be familiar to folks using them for sleep apnea.

"(This is the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine) 

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Until very recently, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had not been authorized for emergency use in persons younger than 16 years of age. Safe, effective vaccines are needed to protect this population, facilitate in-person learning and socialization, and contribute to herd immunity.

METHODS

In this ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive two injections, 21 days apart, of 30 μg of BNT162b2 or placebo. Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-to-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19; onset, ≥7 days after dose 2) in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort were assessed.

RESULTS

Overall, 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79 to 86% of participants], fatigue [in 60 to 66%], and headache [in 55 to 65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants relative to 16-to-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no Covid-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100).

CONCLUSIONS

The BNT162b2 vaccine in 12-to-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against Covid-19.

Abstract

Background:

Cardiovascular diseases and/or risk factors (CVDRF) have been reported as risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods and Results:

In total, we selected 693 patients with CVDRF from the CLAVIS-COVID database of 1,518 cases in Japan. The mean age was 68 years (35% females). Statin use was reported by 31% patients at admission. Statin users exhibited lower incidence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) insertion (1.4% vs. 4.6%, odds ratio [OR]: 0.295, P=0.037) and septic shock (1.4% vs. 6.5%, OR: 0.205, P=0.004) despite having more comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus.

Conclusions:

This study suggests the potential benefits of statins use against COVID-19.",nmiwsm,2021-05-27 23:06:16

"> **Abstract**

> Background: The wearing of medical and non-medicaal masks by the general public in community settings is one intervention that is important for the reduction of SARS-COV-2 transmission, and has been the subject of considerable research, policy, advocacy and debate.  Several observational studies have used ecological (population-level) data to assess the effect of masks on transmission, hospitalization, and mortality at the region or community level.  

> Methods: We undertook this systematic review to summarize the study designs, outcomes, and key quality indicators of using ecological data to evaluate the association between mask wearing and COVID-19 outcomes.  We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 global literature database up to 4 March 2021 for studies reporting the impact of mask use in community settings on outcomes related to SARS-COV-2 transmission using ecologic data.  

> Findings: 21 articles were identified that analysed ecological data to assess the protective effect of policies mandating community mask wearing. All studies reported SARS-COV-2 benefits in terms of reductions in either the incidence, hospitalization, or mortality, or a combination of these outcomes. Few studies assessed compliance to mask wearing policies or controlled for the possible influence of other preventive measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, and information about compliance to these policies was lacking.  

>Interpretation: Ecological studies have been cited as evidence to advocate for the adoption of universal masking policies. The studies summarized by this review suggest that community mask policies may reduce the population-level burden of SARS-CoV-2. Methodological limitations, in particular controlling for the actual practice of mask wearing and other preventive policies make it difficult to determine causality. There are several important limitations to consider for improving the validity of ecological data.",nmew95,2021-05-28 00:21:56

Title: **Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI Abnormalities in Dyspneic Participants 3 Months after COVID-19 Pneumonia: Preliminary Results**

ABSTRACT

>Background  
SARS-CoV-2 targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing cells in the respiratory tract. There are reports of breathlessness in patients many months post-infection.  
Purpose  
This study aimed to determine if hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI (XeMRI) imaging could identify the possible cause of breathlessness in patients three months after hospital discharge following COVID-19 infection.  
Materials and Methods  
This prospective study was undertaken between August and December 2020, with patients and healthy control volunteers enrolled. All patients underwent: lung function tests; ventilation and dissolved phase XeMRI, with the mean Red Blood Cell (RBC):Tissue Plasma (TP) ratio to be calculated; and a low dose chest CT scored for the degree of post-COVID-19 abnormalities. Healthy controls underwent XeMRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for volunteer and patient scans, to assess repeatability. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Cohen's effect size calculated to assess for differences between RBC:TP in patient and controls.  
Results  
9 patients (mean age 57±7 years, Male = 6) and 5 volunteers (29 ± 3 years, Female = 5) were enrolled. Patient mean time from hospital discharge was 169, range 116-254 days. There was a difference in RBC:TP between patients and controls (0.3 ± 0.1 versus 0.5 ± 0.1, respectively, p = 0.001, effect size = 1.36). There was significant difference between the RBC and gas phase spectral full width at half maximum (FWHM) between volunteers and patients (median ± 95 % confidence interval, 567 ± 1 vs 507 ± 81, p = 0.002 and 104 ± 2 vs 122 ± 17, p = 0.004, respectively). Results were reproducible with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of 0.82 and 0.88 for patients and volunteers respectively. Participants had normal or near normal CT scans, mean 7/25, range 0-10/25.  
Conclusion  
Xe MRI showed alveolar-capillary diffusion limitation in all 9 post COVID-19 pneumonia patients despite normal or nearly normal CT scans.",nlqnp3,2021-05-26 21:49:37
"I’m not smart enough to fully understand this, but at the current stage it looks like this is a very small sample of patients particularly affected by the original disease. It only confirms that long term lung damage is possible rather than the implication from the headline (at least by my interpretation) that it is common or inevitable across all those who have recovered from the disease?",nlqnp3,2021-05-27 13:30:00
"Key Results

■ In nine patients evaluated at 3 months post hospital discharge for COVID-19, hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI identifies regional RBC:TP abnormalities, in comparison to healthy controls, (0.3 ± 0.1 versus 0.5 ± 0.1, respectively, p = 0.001, effect size = 1.36) despite structurally normal/near normal lungs on CT post COVID-19 pneumonia.

■ Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI gas transfer abnormalities are present post COVID-19 pneumonia even when patient clinical measurements such as D-dimer, hemoglobin and lung function tests are within normal range.

■ These abnormalities were detected in the presence of contemporaneous normal/near normal CT scans (mean score = 7/25, range = 0-10/25).",nlqnp3,2021-05-27 12:58:19

"Hmm. Any MDs/biologists here know if RBC:TP ratios are supposed to be more or less the same from ages 25-60? The control (healthy) group is much younger than the patient group. I’d imagine the ratio decreases with age, unless RBC count and TP count are not linearly proportional.",nlqnp3,2021-05-27 16:24:18
Are young women really a valid control group to compare to patients consisting mainly of middle-aged men?,nlqnp3,2021-05-27 14:40:02
Any idea why the findings on XeMRI didn't correlate with CO-diffusion?,nlqnp3,2021-05-28 07:48:27
"It is a very small sample, but it was true for everyone in the study.  It should be repeated with a larger sample, but I strongly disagree that it says nothing about likelihood of long term effects.

As much as you accept any findings at all from the study, long term effects are common with severe covid is the takeaway.",nlqnp3,2021-05-27 17:22:05
So it's just simply that? The whole article is too complex for me to understand.,nlqnp3,2021-05-27 04:12:46
They're quoting [an earlier study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.28609) where this was the case.,nlqnp3,2021-05-28 07:45:31
"Also we already know that a lot of people have symptoms like [fatigue and shortness of breat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01292-y/figures/3)h after they have COVID. So finding that lung function is impaired is really not *that* surprising. I think this is mostly interesting because it helps explain why some of these symptoms may be happening,",nlqnp3,2021-05-28 03:13:20
"I agree. If you find the same results in all patients with the disease and none without, even with a small sample size it is still a very strong indication that the result is true. 

When discussing things like this I always tend to think about how many people one would need to drop from a high altitude to prove that parachutes work :)",nlqnp3,2021-05-27 17:27:10
"Totally agree that it’s a good indicator, just that the sample is small both absolutely and in variance of impact of the original illness (from what others are saying). So we have a very good indicator that, probably, the most vulnerable to the disease are also most vulnerable to long term effects in a physical, verifiable way - though I’m not sure if this was ever seriously disputed anyway, so confused as to why this was the focus, unless results have been released somewhat prematurely. It looks like we only have hints that there’s physical evidence of long term harm in those who suffered minor or no symptoms of the disease - even though there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence.

"Abstract

During the last months many countries have started the immunization of millions of people by using vector-based vaccines. Unfortunately, severe side effects became overt during these vaccination campaigns: cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST), absolutely rare under normal life conditions, were found as a severe side effect that occured 4-14 days after first vaccinations. 

Besides CVST, Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis (SVT) was also observed. This type of adverse event has not been observed in the clinical studies of AstraZeneca, and therefore led immediately to a halt in vaccinations in several european countries. These events were mostly associated with thrombocytopenia, and thus, similar to the well-known Heparin-induced thrombo­cytopenia (HIT). 

Meanwhile, scientists have proposed a mechanism to explain this vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia. However, they do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the late thromboembolic events. Here, we present data that may explain these severe side effects which have been attributed to adenoviral vaccines. 

According to our results, transcription of wildtype and codon-optimized Spike open reading frames enables alternative splice events that lead to C-terminal truncated, soluble Spike protein variants. These soluble Spike variants may initiate severe side effects when binding to ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in blood vessels. 

In analogy to the thromboembolic events caused by Spike protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we termed the underlying disease mechanism the “Vaccine-Induced Covid-19 Mimicry” syndrome (VIC19M syndrome).",nlo2xk,2021-05-26 19:36:24

Just a layperson here, but wondering if, this is a covid mimicry issue, people who previously had covid might have a leg up in knocking out these rogue spikes better than those who have not?   I seem to recall that countries with very light early covid waves (e.g., the Scandinavian countries) were seeing problems with AZ at much higher rates than, e.g., England, which had very heavy early waves and high seroprevalance in the population.  Perhaps that would explain some of the discrepancy in cases.",nlo2xk,2021-05-27 11:35:40

"For anyone who wants a TL;DR of the “why” part:

When the body goes to make something using genetic instructions, it first copies DNA to RNA, then uses the RNA instructions to make the protein.

The mRNA vaccines enter the cells already as RNA, so they skip transcription (the “DNA to RNA” step), while the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines enter the cells as DNA (just little stray pieces, it’s not merged into your DNA), which means they have to undergo translation.

During or shortly after transcription, something called splicing happens - if you think of DNA as a book, splicing can lead to pages being added/removed/reorganized in the RNA copy of the book so it doesn’t look exactly the same as the DNA copy.

This paper proposes that sometimes something is happening during splicing that produces different versions of the spike protein, and that some of these different versions can interact with the ACE receptor in a way that sets off clotting.

To TL;DR the TL;DR: AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have to go from DNA to RNA to protein, and this paper suggests the problem that causes the clotting is something going wrong with the “DNA to RNA” part. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are already RNA, so they get to skip this step, and that might explain why they don’t seem to have the same clotting issues.",nlo2xk,2021-05-27 01:50:22

A little like how most of the time when someone consumes a bunch of alcohol they get drunk, but a few people get facial flushing and a headache instead — there’s not something wrong with the alcohol if someone reacts this way, their body just processes alcohol differently than most.

If this is what’s happening, it wouldn’t be related to the immune system, because the spicing is happening inside of a cell, before the spike protein is even produced to trigger an immune response.

"I haven't read specific sources mentioning this, but I would expect *some amount* of soluble free-floating spike proteins to be present at various concentrations over time in all cases, vaccine or natural infection.

Host cells lyse. Virions lyse. Protein contents go everywhere, and that includes free spike proteins that were in the cytosol in the middle of virion assembly inside of host cells. I would imagine that some spikes can also detach from the viral envelope itself.

A small study already found soluble spike proteins in the plasma of mRNA vaccine recipients, but honestly this isn't overly surprising:

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075

Given this, clearly there is some amount of soluble spike protein that's very unlikely to be harmful, and some amount this is likely to be harmful, so more research needs to go into determining what dosage of soluble spike protein is needed to be harmful and design and/or confirm that our vaccines never reach that amount. 

Based on the data that we have, it's likely that the mRNA vaccines currently don't induce enough soluble spike protein production, and for long enough, to be at high risk of immediate spike-protein-induced injury.",nlo2xk,2021-05-31 09:08:28

"**Abstract**

Disease manifestations in COVID-19 range from mild to severe illness associated with a dysregulated innate immune response. Alterations in function and regeneration of dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes may contribute to immunopathology and influence adaptive immune responses in COVID-19 patients. We analyzed circulating DC and monocyte subsets in 65 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate or severe disease from acute disease to recovery and in healthy controls. Persisting reduction of all DC subpopulations was accompanied by an expansion of proliferating Lineage- HLADR+ cells lacking DC markers. Increased frequency of the recently discovered CD163+ CD14+ DC3 subpopulation in patients with more severe disease was associated with systemic inflammation, activated T follicular helper cells, and antibody-secreting cells. Persistent downregulation of CD86 and upregulation of PD-L1 in conventional DC (cDC2 and DC3) and classical monocytes associated with a reduced capacity to stimulate naive CD4+ T cells correlated with disease severity. Long-lasting depletion and functional impairment of DCs and monocytes may have consequences for susceptibility to secondary infections and therapy of COVID-19 patients.",nm15vu,2021-05-27 13:32:23

>**Abstract**
>**Importance**  Although effective vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed, additional vaccines are still needed.

>**Objective**  To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of 2 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines.

>**Design, Setting, and Participants**  Prespecified interim analysis of an ongoing randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain among adults 18 years and older without known history of COVID-19. Study enrollment began on July 16, 2020. Data sets used for the interim analysis of efficacy and adverse events were locked on December 20, 2020, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

>**Interventions**  Participants were randomized to receive 1 of 2 inactivated vaccines developed from SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 (5 µg/dose; n = 13 459) and HB02 (4 µg/dose; n = 13 465) strains or an aluminum hydroxide (alum)–only control (n = 13 458); they received 2 intramuscular injections 21 days apart.

>**Main Outcomes and Measures**  The primary outcome was efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 14 days following a second vaccine dose among participants who had no virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomization. The secondary outcome was efficacy against severe COVID-19. Incidence of adverse events and reactions was collected among participants who received at least 1 dose.

>**Results**  Among 40 382 participants randomized to receive at least 1 dose of the 2 vaccines or alum-only control (mean age, 36.1 years; 32 261 [84.4%] men), 38 206 (94.6%) who received 2 doses, contributed at least 1 follow-up measure after day 14 following the second dose, and had negative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction test results at enrollment were included in the primary efficacy analysis. During a median (range) follow-up duration of 77 (1-121) days, symptomatic COVID-19 was identified in 26 participants in the WIV04 group (12.1 [95% CI, 8.3-17.8] per 1000 person-years), 21 in the HB02 group (9.8 [95% CI, 6.4-15.0] per 1000 person-years), and 95 in the alum-only group (44.7 [95% CI, 36.6-54.6] per 1000 person-years), resulting in a vaccine efficacy, compared with alum-only, of 72.8% (95% CI, 58.1%-82.4%) for WIV04 and 78.1% (95% CI, 64.8%-86.3%) for HB02 (P < .001 for both). Two severe cases of COVID-19 occurred in the alum-only group and none occurred in the vaccine groups. Adverse reactions 7 days after each injection occurred in 41.7% to 46.5% of participants in the 3 groups; serious adverse events were rare and similar in the 3 groups (WIV04: 64 [0.5%]; HB02: 59 [0.4%]; alum-only: 78 [0.6%]).

"Abstract

>>The spike protein is a focused target of COVID-19, a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. A 12-nt insertion at S1/S2 in the spike coding sequence yields a furin cleavage site, which raised controversy views on origin of the virus. Here we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of coronavirus spike proteins and mapped furin recognition motif on the tree. Furin cleavage sites occurred independently for multiple times in the evolution of the coronavirus family, supporting the natural occurring hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2.

Ive been reading about cleavage sites this week and am curious if folks have other material they would like to share. Im on the fence about the origins of this feature in sars-cov-2. convergent evolution is often seen in these viruses and this feature has appeared independently before in other betacoronaviri. as shown here a simple deletion can result in the sequence: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0

however a case can be made that it appears quite suddenly without any known host to facilitate the adaptation. is it just the case we still havent found the animal host->human interface that drove this convergent mutation or did lab research have a hand? genuinely curious for some more reading sources.",nlh6lr,2021-05-26 14:44:44

"Without identifying the animal reservoir for SARS and also SARS-COV2 it's a hard question to answer.  Recombination+insertion appears to be an unlikely mechanism, but could be evolved via deletion mutation we've seen COV-2 prone to do.

>> A minimal FCS could potentially have evolved via a single point mutation T678R (Li et al. 2015), which is evolutionarily more parsimonious than a complete 12nt insertion of ‘PRRA’. A multi basic cleavage site is also plausible with an additional mutation N679R. We note that deletions but not insertions frequently happen at the S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV-2 during serial cell passage (Peacock et al. 2020) and have also been detected in strains isolated from hamsters and humans (Lau et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020c). The acquisition of the FCS via a natural insert, when a FCS could have evolved far more easily though point mutation, we believe is highly unlikely.

https://iv.iiarjournals.org/content/35/3/1313   
>Given the code redundancy, the probability for an identical sequence encoding threonine (pos 678; which can be encoded by ACA, ACG, ACC and ACT) is 0.25×0.25=0.0625, and that of proline (pos 681; encoded by CCT, CCC, CCA and CCG) is again 0.0625. The overall probability harboring the same nucleotide sequence in these two positions is 0.0039. 

From what I can tell, the matter turns not on whether a furin cleavage site is present, but on whether the furin cleavage site with this particular genetic arrangement was likely, unlikely, or possible to have occurred naturally.  I hope a lot more geneticists contribute to resolving this issue, because I'm unaware of a consensus.",nlh6lr,2021-05-26 18:24:30
"My understanding is inexpert at best, but the issue is not just that the furin cleavage site occurs, it is the specific composition of the codons of the arginine doublet in COVID-19 that is the mystery of this virus's origins. There appears to be no easy solution to the question of how this combination could have arisen.",nlh6lr,2021-05-26 18:19:07

"There doesn’t need to be an intermediate.  In a single viral infection, literally trillions of copies are made.  Very low-probability events that lead to more fit viruses become likely at copy numbers like that.

It might have taken one person going into a cave (or that mine) and getting infected with the CoV2 predecessor.  That one person would not have become very ill, but would have generated a copy that had the furin site during the course of his infection.  That one Rossian “happy little accident” would have generated a quasispecies that was much better at replicating in human cells than its progenitor.  The initial patient would have already been developing an adaptive immune response to that progenitor and so might not have been very ill when he coughed in a public place…

…and when he did, he would have coughed out the very first few thousand particles of SARS-CoV-2.",nlh6lr,2021-05-26 15:54:21

">no easy solution to the arginine question

I think you're radically overestimating the stability of viral genomes and radically underestimating evolutionary pressure.  On a macroscopic level if you can get from a wild Siberian fox to a super cute domestic one in a dozen generations (can't link to any popular source here, but go look, the change in morphology and behaviour is stunning) then the arginine question doesn't even raise an eyebrow.",nlh6lr,2021-06-01 12:59:06
">The intermediaries for both SARS and MERS, for example, were discovered within a couple months.

This is one of those comparisons that sounds meaningful but actually isn't. 

MERS has something close to 100% antibody seroprevalence in dromedary camels. You wonder if a camel could be the reservoir, you test a camel, you have evidence. 

In the case of SARS, civets *from the source of initial infection* were tested, and identified as a source. But civets in surrounding farms? Civets up the supply chain. Nope. It was only that particular population of civets which provided the clear link. Unfortunately for investigatory purposes (but with good reason) the population of animals that might have been the direct source of SARS-COV-2 in the Wuhan market were not tested - so we're doing the equivalent of checking nearby civet farms. 

As a contrasting piece of evidence: It's been decades, and nobody's ever found a bat with Ebola. There's a high degree of confidence that bats are the reservoir. We are even pretty confident which know of a specific cave where Ebola-carrying bats live. But still, the evidence is entirely circumstantial: nobody's ever been able to see, ""This bat! Look!""

Finding the animal source is one of those things where you either get really lucky, or it's really really hard.",nlh6lr,2021-05-30 17:02:11

">Also, why weren't outside investigators allowed in before the Wuhan markets were were shut down in February?

I dunno, this really feels like grasping at straws. Shutting down a probable source of transmission is what you do in an epidemic. The shut the place down like two days after it was identified as a probable locus of transmission.

There's a natural tension between what you do to stop a pandemic and what you do to investigate the source of one. Yeah, from an investigatory standpoint, it would have been great if investigators had gone to the market before anything changed. That's how they identified civets as the probably source of SARS-1. 

They also didn't close the market in February - they closed it on January 1st. There was no team out outside (of China) experts to send at that point. The WHO team didn't get there until the 31st. There was no team to send on January 1.

&#x200B;

> Also when the WHO team was allowed in and allowed to do testing surveys in the markets and elsewhere - when they went into the labs they only questioned employees. 

Members of the WHO team were on a recent episode of TWIV and I'd strongly encourage you to listen to it. It's clear that they don't feel like they were particularly being prevented from following the pathways they felt were important to study. All of the team members agree that while they can not rule out a lab origin, they consider it rather unlikely.",nlh6lr,2021-05-29 23:23:01
"I do see your points. Still, if the Chinese government has nothing to cover up they are acting as if they do imo - which doesn't help.

">Apparently they have canceled the phase two investigation that was to be conducted by WHO investigators. Why?

I believe this is incorrect, although if you have a source I'm happy to be corrected. I can't find a news article indicating this, although I can find one from two days that is about people eager for the phase 2 to get going, which contain no indication that China has thrown up any roadblocks.

>Then the Wall Street Journal reports that initially the lab indicated that there were no lab workers hospitalized just before the outbreak - which wasn't the case apparently

Three people got sick with respiratory sypmtoms during a period when people typically get sick with respiratory symptoms. 

It's worth pointing out that in the US, if you got sick and then months later somebody was investigating your employer, your employer would not be allowed to talk about why you were sick or the extent of your illness. Chinese people have privacy rights, as well.

They didn't delete the data. They took it off their web page. In January (which is more than ""a couple of months ago"") Why? Jeeze - probably because they don't want a bunch of people who don't understand the science cherry picking random bits of data they don't understand, which is something we've seen PLENTY of.

"Avoiding the sub's (generally excellent) filter bot is hard, here, so I'm just going to respond to one thing:

The hospitalizations. From what we know about COVID, if there were 3 hospitalizations (and by the way, we have negative serology from everyone who was at the Wuhan Institute of Virology) of working-age people, then we would expect over 50 cases, and probably many times that, in the general population. And we know, pre-mitigation, how quickly 50 cases becomes several hundred. So it actually fails the silly test (even if we didn't have or trust the serology data) to suggest that there was this sort of outbreak, when, in fact, we also know that there was a significant influenza outbreak in the area at the time. 

Furthermore, the presence of the A and B lineages at different markets strongly suggests multiple infections across markets early, which is consistent with animals being the source but become somewhat torturous if you want to explain how that happened with a lab leak.",nlh6lr,2021-05-31 01:01:16
Also the analogy that what would the United States do if China demanded come in and do an investigation doesn't fly as far as I can see.

"**Abstract**

Sinus venous thrombosis has been linked to immunization with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. The initial trigger for this serious adverse event has not been determined. We analyzed the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine by biochemical and proteomic methods. We found that the vaccine, in addition to the adenovirus vector, contains substantial amounts of both human and non-structural viral proteins. Among the human proteins, heat-shock proteins and cytoskeletal proteins were particularly abundant. The often-observed strong clinical reaction one or two days after vaccination is likely associated with the detected protein impurities. A linkage to later immune-related adverse events is also conceivable. The here reported identification of specific classes of protein impurities should guide and accelerate efforts to increase the purity of the vaccine and increase its safety and efficacy.",nlrewr,2021-05-26 23:09:02

"#Abstract

**Background:** Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have provided an invaluable resource in the fight against this infection. Given the current vaccine shortage, vaccination programs must prioritize their distribution to the most appropriate segments of the population. 

**Methods:** We carried out a prospective cohort study with 63 health care workers (HCWs) from a public General Hospital. We compared antibody responses to two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine between HCWs with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination (experienced HCWs) and HCWs who were not previously infected (naive HCWs).

**Results:** Seven days after the first vaccine dose HCWs with previous infection experienced a 126 fold increase in antibody levels (GMC 26955 AU; 95% CI 18785-35125). However, in the HCW naive group the response was much lower and only 5 of them showed positive antibody levels (>50 AU). The HCWs with previous infection did not significantly increased their antibody levels after the second dose while there was a significant increase in the naive HCW group (16 fold; GMC 20227 AU; 95% CI: 15179-25275). Approximately two months after completing vaccination, the level of antibodies was much lower in naive HCWs (GMC 6595 AU vs. 25003 AU; p<0.001) 

**Conclusion:** The study shows that 10 months after the disease has passed, the immune system is capable of producing a rapid and powerful secondary antibody response after one single dose of the vaccine. This response reflects the persistence of immunological memory and it is independent of whether or not anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detected in blood. Besides, we found that the second dose does not improve the antibody response in individuals with previous Covid-19 infection. Nonetheless, two months later, the persistence of antibody levels is still higher in the experienced HCWs. These data suggest that immune memory remains for a long time in recovered individuals, and therefore, vaccination in this group could be postponed until immunization of the rest of the population is complete.",nlmqn8,2021-05-26 18:38:34

"#Abstract

**Background:** Both BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines show good efficacy in clinical trials and real-world data. However, some still contract SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination. This study identifies risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 14 days after first vaccination and describes characteristics of post-vaccination illness.

**Methods:** Cases were UK adults reporting post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection between 8th December 2020 and 1st May 2021, reporting on the COVID Symptom Study app. We assessed the associations of age, frailty, comorbidity, area-level deprivation and lifestyle factors with infection (vaccinated cases vs. negative-vaccinated controls); and vaccination with illness profile (vaccinated cases vs positive-unvaccinated controls).

**Findings:** Post-vaccination infection risk was substantially higher in older adults with frailty (OR= 2.78, 95% CI [1.98-3.89], p-value<0.0001) and in individuals living in most deprived areas (OR vs. intermediate group=1.22, 95%CI [1.04-1.43], p-value=0.01). Risk was lower in individuals with a healthier diet (OR=0.73, 95%CI [0.62-0.86], p-value<0.0001) and without obesity (OR=0.6, 95% CI [0.44-0.82], p-value=0.001). Vaccination was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR=0.36, 95%CI [0.28-0.46], p-value<0.0001), and high acute-symptom burden (OR=0.51, 95%CI [0.42-0.61], p-value<0.0001). In the 60+ age group, risk of >28 days illness was lower following vaccination (OR=0.72 , 95%CI [0.51-1.00], p-value=0.05). Most symptoms were reported less in positive-vaccinated vs. positive-unvaccinated individuals, except sneezing, which was more common post-vaccination (OR=1.24, 95%CI [1.05-1.46], p-value=0.01). 

**Interpretation:** Our findings highlight reduced symptom burden and duration in those infected post-vaccination. Whilst reassuring, our data should prompt efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness in at-risk populations; moreover, targeted infection control measures will still be appropriate to minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection.",nlmptq,2021-05-26 18:37:43

"**Abstract**

A wide range of neurological manifestations have been associated with the development of COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the etiology of the neurological symptomatology is still largely unexplored. Here, we used state-of-the-art multiplexed immunostaining of human brains (n = 6 COVID-19, median age = 69,5 years; and n = 7 control, median age = 68 years), and demonstrated that expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is restricted to a subset of neurovascular pericytes. Strikingly, neurological symptoms were exclusive to, and ubiquitous in, patients that exhibited moderate to high ACE2 expression in peri-vascular cells. Viral particles were identified in the vascular wall and paralleled by peri-vascular inflammation, as signified by T cell and macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, fibrinogen leakage indicated compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid from an additional 16 individuals (n = 8 COVID-19, median age = 67 years; and n = 8 control, median age = 69,5 years) exhibited significantly lower levels of the pericyte marker PDGFRβ in SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, indicative of disrupted pericyte homeostasis. We conclude that pericyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 underlies virus entry into the privileged central nervous system space, as well as neurological symptomatology due to peri-vascular inflammation and a locally compromised blood-brain barrier.",nla934,2021-05-26 18:45:14

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lived bone marrow plasma cells in humans
24 May 2021


Abstract

Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1–7. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent individuals have a significantly lower risk of reinfection8–10. Nonetheless, it has been reported that anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies experience rapid decay in the first few months after infection, raising concerns that long-lived BMPCs may not be generated and humoral immunity against this virus may be short-lived11–13.

**Here we demonstrate that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=77), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies decline rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months, remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection.**

Anti-S antibody titers correlated with the frequency of S-specific BMPCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

**We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment. Consistently, circulating resting memory B cells directed against the S protein were detected in the convalescent individuals.** Overall, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune response in humans.",nl8siu,2021-05-31 00:45:05
"They are a type of B cell. We have a few types - naïve, plasmablasts (short lived), memory B cells (dormant), the above mentioned LLPCs (active cells that produce antibodies long term) and probably some others that I'm not familiar with.",nl8siu,2021-05-26 10:37:23

"Because the level of infection/illness/dose matters as to how much immunity one's body produces.  Just because a person has had covid doesn't mean that they *have* lifelong immunity, and we aren't going to be checking ***everyone*** anytime soon.

"Objective: We evaluated whether ivermectin combined with doxycycline reduced the clinical recovery time in adults with COVID-19 infection.

Methods: This was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms randomly assigned to treatment (n = 200) and placebo (n = 200) groups. The primary outcome was duration from treatment to clinical recovery. Secondary outcomes were disease progression and persistent COVID-19 positivity by RT-PCR.

Results: Among 556 screened patients, 400 were enrolled and 363 completed follow-up. The mean patient age was 40 years, and 59% were men. The median recovery time was 7 (4-10, treatment group) and 9 (5-12, placebo group) days (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.90). The number of patients with a ≤7-day recovery was 61% (treatment group) and 44% (placebo groups) (hazard ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.09). The proportion of patients who remained RT-PCR positive on day 14 and whose disease did not progress was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group.

Conclusions: Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection treated with ivermectin plus doxycycline recovered earlier, were less likely to progress to more serious disease, and were more likely to be COVID-19 negative by RT-PCR on day 14.",nl7ogw,2021-05-26 04:51:33
"There's some tens(!) of lower quality RCT studies pointing to efficacy, like the one linked here. There's high quality small RCT studies trending or having statistically significant pointers to efficacy (Chaccour et al, the JAMA study on published side, Schwartz et al, Huvemek on press release level). Obviously none of these have statistically significant proof of efficacy on hospitalization or mortality level, but good pointers ivm is definitely doing something.

Then there's observational studies, for example the published ICON study from Florida with more than 70 percent mortality reduction and Mexico City pre-print comparing population level early treatment to no treatment, with 52 to 76 percent hospitalization reduction with over 80000(!) patients in analysis.

And all this for a drug which is cheap, easily available, easy to administer and safe enough for WHO to recommend for mass campaigns against parasites.

Why is this not gathering any more interest?",nl7ogw,2021-05-26 10:38:53
"Also, 3 out of 180 patients died in the placebo group while 0 out of 183 died in the treatment group. 

Not sure how statistically significant that is, though, since they didn't mention it in the conclusion.",nl7ogw,2021-05-26 07:22:33
"This is a very good question - how do these approval processes work? What's the missing piece? Higher-quality data? Funding to push it through the process?

Seemingly reputable associations like FLCCC, who strongly support mass vaccinations and otherwise agree with scientific consensus, are advocating for Ivermectin treatment protocols based on the available data.

Could anyone explain the process?

(before you downvote -- I do NOT suggest any kind of conspiracy, I'm asking purely for information on how such treatments get approved/recommended, not opinions or speculation)",nl7ogw,2021-05-26 15:42:47
"This is a small trial, you can’t conclude anything about IVM alone because ivermectin was combined with doxycycline, and the treatment group was younger than the placebo group, comorbidities looked worse in the placebo group, there was just 64 patients above 60 and a non-significant effect in this age group in the subgroup analysis.  IVM did not seem to work at all for 'moderate' severity COVID, a big 'if' that it even reduces mild symptoms, but that is where the effect is, no reason whatsoever to believe from this research that IVM would keep patients out of the hospital or reduce mortality at all.  The authors admit that you can't get a sufficient C50 with approved levels of IVM and ask for studies with higher levels even though nobody knows what happens if you give like 20 times as much IVM to a patient, they'd first need to do a study showing those levels are even safe which they probably are not.  This study excluded patients with more serious illness, such as those with hypoxia and who were heading to the hospital, and it used ""soft endpoints"" such as symptoms resolution, hypothesis generating, but not enough to recommend either doxycycline or ivermectin.",nl7ogw,2021-05-26 23:20:36
I think perhaps because it is not novel?,nl7ogw,2021-05-26 11:03:16
"Here's why not more interest:

1. Low reason to believe that Ivermectin works out of the gate as the laboratory evidence was flawed as it used IVM levels something like 30x what you can even achieve in a human to ""kill"" the virus in a cell culture and probably would damage human cells, same lab in Australia believed that Ivermectin can help with Zika based on cell culture results, IVM kills parasitic worms by paralyzing them, I don't believe it has ever been used as an antiviral.
2. A review of all of the RCT to date by a team in Miami and Peru concluded that the available evidence in February 2021 was low quality and subject to bias and I would agree having read the research, WHO advises against IVM outside of a trial.
3. A March 2021 JAMA trial of 476 patients, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777389, concluded that IVM does NOT decrease time to resolution of symptoms with mild COVID-19.  OK, so we get this trial that is Doxycycline + Ivermectin, and uses also the same soft endpoints (a drug might mildly reduce symptoms but not effect mortality or the progression to severe disease), can't conclude anything about Ivermectin alone as this trial compared Ivermectin + Doxycycline to . . . placebo, which is an odd thing to do . . . like literally this is not what your supposed to do in a clinical research trial.
4. FLCCC doesn't develop drugs, or even hold randomized controlled trials as the highest form of evidence but instead rely on their own ""instincts"" and undocumented observations of patients (which I doubt they randomize to different medications). . . .unlike the highly awarded and regard RECOVERY trial, FLCCC has produce no research with regards to COVID just random remarks that IVM must have worked in India . . . even though things are bad in India despite using this drug, and they might reference one or two patients whom they believed were saved by IVM even though most patients recover on their own or perhaps in spite of IVM.
5. People ARE interested, at least theoretically, a young doctor at University of Minnesota is doing a trial to see if IVM, given to 1,100 patients who are recently  SARS-CoV-2 positive, if it can prevent hospitalizations and severe disease compared to placebo, and this is a significant endpoints . . . just looking at soft/subjective endpoints like symptoms doesn't prove a lot, and there is a publication bias as studies showing effects of IVM are more likely to be published by people who blindly believe in the drug.  I'm surprised there haven't been dozens of weak and suggestive IVM research by now really.",nl7ogw,2021-05-27 00:16:02
This sounds oddly familiar. Did we see this research before here?,nl7ogw,2021-05-26 17:33:06
"FLCCC's approach is flawed as they base their recommendations on what they observe with their patients, which might sound impressive, this is not science just sort of ""eyeballing"" it and they often puff their credentials as ""world reknown"" doctors . . . FLCCC doesn't do trials they just publish unsupported opinions.  A lab found an in vitro result favoring ivermectin, but they used something like 30 (50?) times the concentration of Ivermectin that could be achived in a human without killing them, same lab has studied ivermectin for 10+ years and believe it is a wonder drug and thought it could cure Zika years ago . . .  One main FLCCC doc said that tocilizumab ""doesn't work"" in a YouTube video and the Recovery trial showed it did, ok, they got that one wrong, they did advocate early for corticosteroids, but at doses higher than subsequently found to work in the Recovery trial last year, though now Recovery is studying high-dose vs standard corticosteroids . . . FLCCC is opposed to randomized controlled trials as they feel doctors should ""doctor"" and basically eyeball stuff.  FLCCC touted the use of ivermectin as last year they believed it's widespread use in India and Brazil helped to control the pandemics there . . . this appears to not be the case.  FLCCC advocated to shutdown a IVM study at Oxford because they believe everybody should know it works and studying IVM in a trial is unethical (which is crazy as nobody who studies this stuff knows it works and a trial is the only way to know).

The smaller RCTs had methodological problems and you couldn't draw firm conclusions, with Ivermectin being sort of politicized there is a publication bias as people who are in favor of ivermectin no matter what will all do studies and the few that are seemingly positive will get published and the others might well be buried.  Other published trials have compared IVM to other medications such as hydroxycholoroquine (probably harmful) and found IVM works as well as HCQ which is useless.

There is a psychological benefit for being on the grandiose quest to show everybody else what only you know to be correct (and FLCCC has hinted that IVM is a wonder drug ""gift"" from somewhere . . . higher power or aliens, beats me), and to save the world with ""secret knowledge.""   Many, many drugs, most actually, fail to show real benefit when going from test tube to small trials to larger trials.  FLCCC has a website where they sell IVM swag, weird t-shirts with a cartoon of IVM molecule which really looks like the SARS-CoV-2 virus with unsubstantiated claims that IVM saves lives . . . one of the FLCCC doctors lost hospital privileges because of this.  Probably FLCCC is ""wrong"" about IVM, we'll see what the evidence shows . . .  I doubt IVM is a miracle drug for COVID . . . the issue is that FLCCC doesn't care about research they are just making a bet that their instincts are correct.

University of Minnesota is going to look at Ivermectin vs. Placebo in 1,100 patients recently diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and see if that drug alone (not in combination with doxycycline) prevent hospitalizations and severe illness.  None of the current trials have looked at this, maybe if you take IVM plus doxy you get some symptomatic relief as they have mild anti-inflammatory effects or maybe it was just publication bias and a high percentage of poorly done studies in a very political climate around IVM use.",nl7ogw,2021-05-26 23:41:58
"1. Like you can't show real world efficacy in lab you can't show non-efficacy either. That being said I'm not at all convinced ivermectin's only mode of action is antiviral.

2. Meta analyses are unfortunately very prone to biases. Depending which studies are included you get very different results. There are also a couple published meta analyses pointing to the other direction.

3. The outcome measures of the JAMA study are favoring ivermectin even if there is no ststistically significant results. There's now more than 20 RCTs with ivermectin in them. Mildly put the results combined do favor ivm.

4. I wasn't bringing FLCCC up.

5. I'm talking about not seeing any buzz around ivermectin either in media or visible medical sciences discussions. This just seems strange to
me given for example the publication from Mexico City. The publication essentially says we treated more than 80000 patients with ivermectin and had great results, more than 50 percent efficacy! And it generates zero public discussion. Why?",nl7ogw,2021-05-27 05:58:59

"IVM appears to trigger you. I read mostly FLCCC bashing.  You don’t need to like them, nor agree with their approach.  Conflating IVM, or another other drug/treatment with another like HCQ as proof “it doesn’t work”, is some kind of cognitive dissonance.

Speaking of treatments in absolute terms, eg. proven/disproven, is unscientific. Speak instead to the data, efficacy measures/intervals from trials, mechanisms of action; and in a pandemic, epidemiology evidence where appropriate.

There are many non-conflicted, qualified, and credible scientists that have stuck their necks out against the group-think in support of adoption of IVM. And they have done so with substantial risk to their reputation.

The doors are swinging towards IVM favor. Many doctors/scientists have been watching on the side-lines over the past 6 months, frustrated waiting for the PHA to “do the right thing”. With increasing frequency governments are starting to act unilaterally against WHO guidelines and moving forward with protocols they think will help based on the weight of the body of evidence. We are in a pandemic after all.",nl7ogw,2021-05-27 21:56:14

">The publication essentially says we treated more than 80000 patients with ivermectin and had great results, more than 50 percent efficacy! And it generates zero public discussion. Why?

This is the point that has causes me the most consternation, why?  
Even if IVM proves ineffective we should be free to discuss it, senate testimonies that mention it should not be removed from social media (youtube).

Is it financial interests and lobbying or the incompetence of bureaucracy?  
I expect that fear is also influencing policy, officials are afraid of taking risk and effectively defer any decision to a higher authority (WHO, FDA).",nl7ogw,2021-06-03 04:25:50
"I just know there are several camps on Ivermectin:

Group A:  WHO, FDA and other regulatory authorities that have vast clinical and research experience who recommend that IVM be used only in clinical trials and have looked at \*all\* the trials and concluded that much of the evidence showing efficacy is of low certainty and biased, and that some RCT show no evidence of efficacy and that there isn't a plausible antiviral mechanism of action, Merck that makes the drug advises against using it to treat COVID at all.  So this group is sort of waiting for evidence for IVM and tons of other drugs to come in from randomized trials, look at the RECOVERY trial, they are going to look at infliximab and other meds, there are probably dozens if not hundreds of treatments undergoing evaluation.

Group B:  Some governments and physicians globally have caved to peer pressure and/or decided to let physicians prescribe reasonable doses of IVM (which may well not do anything) to avoid more severe toxicity from people buying IVM off the black market.  In some places there is a notion that a doctor must give a pill to patient suffering from any disease, even if antibiotics aren't indicated they are often overused as physicians in developing countries and also in the US find it hard to tell patients that they antibiotic they want isn't needed and may cause side effects.  Also, some governments which didn't buy vaccines and haven't funded their healthcare systems want to do something to look like they are ""curing"" COVID so they allow IVM and other unproven drugs to be used, which can cause damage if people think there is a ""cure"" out there being used then why get vaccinated, pressure the government about more oxygen or mask up?

Group C:  Smaller group of doctors who have made emotional arguments about IVM and accused WHO/FDA as no longer being able to be ""trusted"" such as FLCCC which makes statements such as, """"**We can no longer rely on many of the larger health authorities to make an honest examination of the medical and scientific evidence. So, we are calling on regional public health authorities and medical professionals around the world to demand that ivermectin be included in their standard of care right away so we can end this pandemic once and for all.**""  Well . . . it isn't known if IVM either prevents or treats COVID in mild or severe forms . . . it just seems like a lot of bravado for a small group of critical care doctors (who sometimes refer to themselves as world reknown) to attack everybody from WHO to NIH whom they laughingly refer to as ""larger"" health authorities, yeah, well the WHO/NIH has resources beyond FLCCC and also . . . interpreting these trials is NOT rocket science and doesn't take a critical care doc with 30+ years experience, just somebody that reads a lot of trials/journal articles and realizes that there is a process to how meds are approved and found to be effective, there isn't some backroom mystical knowledge about IVM and if you aren't doing research then you can't just look at patients and make general assumption about what works.

Group D:  Some people believe in an almost conspiracy theory such that FDA/WHO and others are covering up the effectiveness of Ivermectin . . . really Ivermectin is just like any other med being investigated with COVID, it has to be backed up with good evidence published in peer reviewed journals, if there was a good RCT of Ivermectin vs. placebo in 2,000 to 3,000 patients that it has efficacy that is the sort of evidence needed, the evidence so far is biased and the bulk of good published evidence shows that it doesn't work.  If the University of Minnesota trial in 1,100 patients shows it doesn't prevent severe disease and has no effect . . . there are probably dozens of other potential existing medications and new ones that are being developed that would be more worthwhile to continue to study.",nl7ogw,2021-05-27 22:55:26
"There haven't been that many published IVM trials yet, the ones that have been are mixed and IVM might be ineffective for reducing mortality in COVID patients and might not reduce symptoms in early COVID, we just don't know yet.  This is not unusual, a lot of meds have mixed results until somebody does a big trial.  Also, how IVM might work at lower concentrations is unclear, if IVM is generally ineffective then by definition it doesn't have a MoA with regards to COVID.  Sometimes researchers think they have a good MoA, the in vitro looks good, Phase 1/2 are promising, but the more statistically powerful Phase 3 shows it doesn't work . . . the real question is why with scant evidence for IVM are people willing to jump over necessary scientific steps?  There are mixed signals on IVM, might well not work in hospitalized patients, but the only way to know for sure is to do a large RCT.",nl7ogw,2021-05-27 07:02:43

"I agree with your Camp A and B but I think you’re off-base on group C. Honestly. 

And please don’t quote a Merck PRESS RELEASE!with no facts or data, or any Pharma company that has obviously conflicts.

Agree the existing set of trials, looked at individually, is insufficient. All are either small, use a flawed design, or suspect of bias. But when you do an honest evaluation of all these trials in a meta analysis, they show a highly statistically significant and impressive mortality benefit. Something in the neighborhood of 0.35 RR. 

There is also A LOT of compelling anecdotal information. Its safety is well established. The epidemiology evidence looks positive.",nl7ogw,2021-05-27 23:07:46
"This is where people disagree, I've found just 3 or 4 high-quality trials or reviews of IVM and COVID that have been published, the non-published stuff (which has been un-published for well over half a year) is not reliable and heavily biased to say the least.  I would say an 'honest' review of the good evidence is mixed to negative and there is lack of any trial with regards to IVM preventing COVID infection or treating hospitalized COVID patients.

You can review half a dozen biased and poor certainty of evidence trials on IVM working and the conclusion won't be solid as the evidence it is based on is not solid.

Bodies like the NIH, FDA and others have literally looked at all the trials (what they have done for thousands of medications) and decided it needs to be studied more and proven to work if doctors want to prescribe it and there isn't evidence it works, I agree having read these trials.

Some people who are boosting IVM make the claim that looking on a country wide scale that IVM works when really models which like IHME which predict COVID surges pretty well look at stuff like masking.  Some of FlCCC epidemiological evidence in the US was definitely flawed as they looked at hospitals (some of theirs) giving IVM and low surge points across their state and compared it to NY when it was bad.

FLCCC has a hypothesis . . . they should have done a trial of IVM, they haven't, what is needed is good evidence.",nl7ogw,2021-05-27 23:27:15

Impact of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on the Gut Microbiota  


>Mokkala et al. \[69\] showed that gut microbiota composition, including both microbiota richness and the abundance of specific taxa, and dietary intakes of omega-3 PUFAs, fibers, and certain vitamins and minerals, are linked to concentrations of serum zonulin.

Seems also that high zonulin is associated with low minerals including selenium and magnesium, and zinc may be protective;

"dietary deficiencies seem to be involved, omega 3 and zinc at least, and fibre.

Also gluten, glyphosate and the BT toxin expressing plants have been suspected, but I'm not sure if there is any evidence of them, but gluten has been implicated.

The syndrome in children has some symptom similarity and potential overlap with Kawasaki disease and this is associated with heavy metal exposure and mercury, and selenium deficiency seems to particularly worsen mercury toxicity since mercury's main source of toxicity seems to be competing with selenium and rendering selonoproteins dysfunctional -

Kawasaki Disease and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19

>Recently, a group of COVID-19 positive test children present with multiple organ inflammatory symptoms that bears a striking resemblance to the inflammatory syndrome symptoms like Kawasaki disease (KD). A study in children and adolescents who had been infected by COVID-19 showed a high proportion in African race. They had presented with gastrointestinal symptom and KD shock syndrome \[14\].  
>  
>Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome  
>  
>Although the evidences showed up a significant relation between the symptoms of KD and COVID-19, not all symptoms were appeared according to the AHA Kawasaki guideline (fever plus four of five criteria); therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) called this phenomenon as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) with the following criteria in “children and adolescents” \[15\]:",nkzjdd,2021-05-25 23:37:36
"Its the opposite -

>Mokkala et al. \[69\] showed that gut microbiota composition, including both microbiota richness and the abundance of specific taxa, and dietary intakes of omega-3 PUFAs, fibers, and certain vitamins and minerals, are linked to concentrations of serum zonulin. The gut microbiota richness differed between the high and low zonulin groups, as exhibited by higher microbiota richness in the low zonulin group. Mokkala et al. \[69\] **found that a higher total intake of omega-3 PUFAs was associated with lower serum zonulin concentrations**.

Higher zonulin is also associated with lower minerals like selenium, magnesium. This is thought to be a consequence of impaired mineral absorption when the intestinal lining is inflamed, but it could also be that these minerals are also protective and play a role in zonulin release, which is a consequence of intestinal damage, so this would create a feedback.

Likewise fibre and zinc seem to be associated with lower intestinal inflammation and permeability or zonulin.",nkzjdd,2021-05-26 15:47:31
"That makes sense. I was initially confused as I know that higher levels of omega 3 (particularly relative to omega 6) can support better outcomes in autoimmune diseases like MS. So then omega 3, zinc etc can potentially lower systemic or gut inflammation if they are associated with lower levels of zonulin. 


Thanks very much for clarifying.",nkzjdd,2021-05-26 16:41:41

Can you elaborate on this as it relates to something like MS? Do the cofactors like zinc and fiber come into play?,nkzjdd,2021-05-27 03:17:42
"I don't know much about zonulin other than this thread and that higher zonulin levels can potentially associated with autoimmune diseases generally such as type 1 diabetes and IBD.  Similarly, there is a possible association of high zonulin and MS also. 


Regarding omega 3, i believe there is a fair bit of research showing that it's not necessarily the level of omega 3,6,9 that can be useful in supporting better MS outcomes, but instead it is the ratio of omega 3 to 6 that seems to be more important. iirc, high levels of omega 3 are possibly important for diet for MS.


Unfortunately I don't know much more about gut issues and MS. Dr Brandon Beaber on YouTube has some very insightful videos where he discussed research studies on MS, including diet studies. His videos might have more info on these issues and zinc, and other minerals.",nkzjdd,2021-05-27 13:27:18

"**Abstract**

Serologic markers that predict severe COVID-19 disease trajectories could enable early medical interventions and reduce morbidity and mortality. We found that distinct features of IgG Fab and Fc domain structures were present within three days of a positive test that predicted two separate disease trajectories in a prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19. One trajectory was defined by early production of neutralizing antibodies and led to mild disease. A distinct trajectory, characterized by an initial period of mild symptoms followed by rapid progression to more severe outcomes, was predicted by the absence of early neutralizing antibody responses with concomitant production of afucosylated IgGs. Elevated frequencies of monocytes expressing the receptor for afucosylated IgGs, FcγRIIIa (CD16a), were an additional antecedent in patients with the more severe outcomes. In mechanistic studies, afucosylated immune complexes in the lung triggered an inflammatory infiltrate and cytokine production that was dependent on CD16a. Finally, in healthy subjects, mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicited neutralizing antibodies that were enriched for Fc fucosylation and sialylation and distinct from both infection-induced trajectories. These data show the importance of combined Fab and Fc domain functions in the antiviral response, define an early antibody signature in people who progressed to more severe COVID-19 outcomes and have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting FcγRIIIa pathways.",nla9j9,2021-05-26 18:44:56

">CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 25, 2021-- Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced that the Phase 2/3 study of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) in adolescents has met its primary immunogenicity endpoint, successfully bridging immune responses to the adult vaccination. In the study, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in participants who had received two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine using the primary definition. In addition, a vaccine efficacy of 93% in seronegative participants was observed starting 14 days after the first dose using the secondary CDC case definition of COVID-19, which tested for milder disease. This study, known as the TeenCOVE study, enrolled more than 3,700 participants ages 12 to less than 18 years in the U.S. The Company plans to submit these data to regulators globally in early June.

>“We are encouraged that mRNA-1273 was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 in adolescents. It is particularly exciting to see that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We will submit these results to the U.S. FDA and regulators globally in early June and request authorization. We remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

>In this Phase 2/3 study, 3,732 adolescent participants ages 12 to less than 18 years were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to two 100 µg doses of mRNA-1273 or placebo. The primary endpoint of non-inferior immunogenicity versus the Phase 3 adult study comparator group was met. After two doses, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in the vaccine group using the case definition from the adult Phase 3 COVE study, compared to 4 cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100% starting 14 days after the second dose. Because the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in adolescents, a secondary case definition based on the CDC definition of COVID-19 was also evaluated to include cases presenting with milder symptoms. Using the CDC definition, which requires only one COVID-19 symptom and a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, a vaccine efficacy of 93% after the first dose was observed.

>mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the Phase 3 COVE study in adults. No significant safety concerns have been identified to date. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common solicited local adverse event was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events after the second dose of mRNA-1273 were headache, fatigue, myalgia and chills.

>Safety data continues to accrue, and the study continues to be monitored by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second injection to assess long-term protection and safety. Consequently, these data are subject to change based on ongoing data collection. The Company plans to submit data from the TeenCOVE study to a peer-reviewed publication.",nkokma,2021-05-25 13:30:26

For BNT-162b2, the FDA fact sheet lists: “(4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine, and cholesterol”

"ABSTRACT

>Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020 case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19 containment requires future research and implementation of existing efficacious strategies.",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 19:55:52
"pretty interesting how there's growing evidence both that masks work and that mask mandates don't work. I definitely get it, but I wouldn't have predicted it.",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 21:16:11
"I only read the abstract but I wonder about ""mask usage predicted lower case growth at low but not high transmission rates"". It makes me think the of the study about mask usage in a university dorm during flu season. If I remember right, neither the mask only group nor the hand washing only group showed a significant decrease in infections but the masks + hand washing did. Perhaps the hand washing lowered transmission rates enough that it became a catalyst of sorts that changed the effectiveness of masks.",nkx6sq,2021-05-26 13:53:14
"IOW's, looks like the mask mandates were useless during surges, when they tended to be tightly imposed and enforced?

What I've seen during the pandemic is some evidence of groupthink: When a study shows that mask policies are efficacious in some way, media and medical commentators tend to not scrutinize the study very carefully. They kind of take it at its word and proclaim that once again this shows that We Need Masks in public life.

But if the study casts doubt on the efficacy of masks or mask mandates, the mask regime rapid-response team swarms out of the woodwork and every aspect of the offending study is picked apart to discredit it, so that the Mask Regime can lumber on unencumbered by the new knowledge.",nkx6sq,2021-05-28 00:30:11
"I know the general thought is that it's people not wearing them in lots of situations, wearing them below the nose, etc, but I think the bigger clue is probably just how masks actually sit on people's faces.

Take a look next time you're out - there are huge gaps around the nose and/or cheeks on pretty much everyone you encounter. Even people wearing N95s or similar often have gaps, because they don't do any sort of fit testing. It doesn't seem surprising that most of your air (including droplets) would take the path of least resistance when you exhale.",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 21:52:15
I give props to the way they worded their conclusions because they limited to mask **mandates**. They don't try to overstate the findings. Could masking be effective? Possibly. But they found no evidence that mandated mask-wearing was beneficial to the purpose of reducing community spread of the virus.,nkx6sq,2021-05-28 13:41:41
"I don't doubt that. I'm out over my skis but as a person who believes SARSCoV2 is primarily transmitted by particles suspended in the air, I'd expect mask fit to be of outsized importance.

But the evidence seems to point that transmission risk is much lower in places where people are required to and do wear masks, and that is despite my own anecdotal evidence that 90% of people I see have terribly fitting masks. The issue seems to be that in a prolonged ""lockdown"" people will find the unmasked locations to congregate. Again, I'm out over my skis, but I think this was a big part of the messaging flub by public health experts. In failing to communicate harm-reduction best practices, they shamed a range of behaviors the same despite being orders of magnitude of difference in risk. Without being given an outlet for social behaviors, people just threw caution to the wind and spread the virus.",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 22:07:43

If masks hadn't been such a political issue, we might have been able to get better masks and traded advice with each other that could improve performance, comfort, etc.",nkx6sq,2021-05-26 06:36:27
"Isn't that sort of exactly what this paper is saying isn't the case? That even mask usage isn't associated with less spread? They looked not only at which states had mandates but also the effect of actual mask usage (based on survey response, so potential bias there).

I am, in general, inclined to agree about people finding outlets regardless, but it seems likely that we'd see an impact here in growth rates on the basis of usage, which we don't really.",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 22:19:50
"> The issue seems to be that in a prolonged ""lockdown"" people will find the unmasked locations to congregate.

It's really hard to know but probably true -- e.g. people wearing their masks on the sidewalk on their way to a 3-hour unmasked gathering with extended family.  In their mind, they wore a mask when in public.

I think there was a lot of bad messaging about masks: no masks early on in the pandemic, not helping people understand masks for source control vs. infection protection, not encouraging at-risk populations to get high-quality filter masks when there was enough supply, requiring masks outdoors, etc.",nkx6sq,2021-05-26 00:02:54
"The places that had mask mandates had outdoor mask mandates as well.

People really minimized what a pain in the ass they were to wear full time. Especially while communicating with people face to face.

People are safer outside without masks than inside with them.

Allowing people to be maskless outside would have been great harm reduction. Instead, people probably felt like they would be fined and judged if they went outside maskless, so if they were going to take their masks off, they were being encouraged to do it inside by the regulations.

When making laws, you need to keep realistic assumptions about human behavior in mind.",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 23:02:24
The survey data is imo worthless and it is only about public mask use. There's so much response bias. Much better to look at the MMWR paper on contact tracing from last year or lots of Linsey Marr's work regarding mask efficacy.,nkx6sq,2021-05-25 22:23:22
"Yes, I think very inconsistent and sometimes plainly stupid and pointless regulations did a lot of harm, as it pushed lots of people into ""resistance mode"" whede they rejected  safety measures all together.
There should have been an effort from beginning to create the rules that have the best value/cost instead of creating super complicated with doubtful value (for example at some point in UK they had a rule that you could sit on a bench and eat something but only if it took longer than 45 minutes walk to get there, so it would be classified as sport and not just recreation)",nkx6sq,2021-05-27 19:15:29
"I'm not sure that outdoor mandates were really very common (MA is the only place that comes to mind), but they were commonly worn outdoors in lots of major cities (certainly SF, Chicago, NYC, and probably lots more).",nkx6sq,2021-05-26 05:45:41
"Even with just public mask usage, why wouldn't you expect that to have an impact?",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 22:27:22
There was never a rule on how far you could go or for how long so far as I know.,nkx6sq,2021-05-28 18:33:30
Well possibly not. If people just moved their unmasked social interaction from public to private it should have net zero effect. Well ventilated and somewhat naturally distanced places like stores and and supermarkets would have to be unlikely locations for spread for that to work. But that's not unreasonable,nkx6sq,2021-05-25 22:33:04
"I'm not in UK so I'm just relating what my sister said (who lives there), but according to her there were some weird rules regarding having a lunch break. Also she reported some people being fined for drinking coffee in their own car. Anyhow the major point was that there were many often very questionable rules not based on any scientific research but rather - ""ok, let's add also xxx ban"" (and it happened in many countries)",nkx6sq,2021-05-28 18:38:23
"Unlikely places would still contribute some, and you'd think you'd see that compounding over time.

But I'm even thinking bigger things like masks in the workplace. People spend a significant portion of their day in fairly close quarters with their coworkers (for the majority not working from home, of course) so that would be somewhere we'd expect to see a big impact, assuming that impact exists.",nkx6sq,2021-05-25 22:45:10
"Absolutely, chaos and confusion reigned, but it was precisely because there were no actual rules or definitions on any of it. As a result a few people got fined for things that weren't actually in breach of the law, based on the discretion of the (very confused and sometimes just overzealous) police. This resulted in lots of people thinking they couldn't do things when legally speaking they absolutely could, but they still might get told off or fined. Shitshow.",nkx6sq,2021-05-28 18:56:58
"If people are social distancing at work, but sharing a small air space for 8 hours, would common masks be effective at preventing spread? Seems non-n95+ masks would only help reduce spread through large aerosols that don't travel far to begin with and most of the spread in an office would be from the smaller aerosols accumulating in the air that poorly performing masks don't really stop.",nkx6sq,2021-05-26 02:25:18
"The [ACGIH pandemic response task force](https://www.acgih.org/covid-19-fact-sheet-worker-resp/) basically agrees with you. I believe they're approaching it from the standpoint of occupational safety of workers, but obviously this would apply to many situations in the community as well.

They're estimating that two people wearing cloth masks increases the time to infection from 15 minutes to 27 minutes, 60 minutes if both are wearing surgical masks, 25 hours with non-fit-texted N95 respirators, and 2500 (!) hours with fit-tested N95 respirators. [Source](https://1lnfej4c7wie44voctzq1r57-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fact_Sheet_Face-Mask.pdf)

I haven't dug into how they came to these numbers, and even cloth masks have a wide range of materials, number of layers, and fit, but to me this chart shows that any mask guideline that I've ever seen is so oversimplified as to be useless, since there's no time component included nor distinction between type of masks. It really makes me disappointed in the messaging in the US.",nkx6sq,2021-05-26 15:59:48
"You'd think they would in some cases at least, which again seems like you'd see in the case rates over time.

If you work in a McDonald's, maybe you're going to catch it regardless if you're working the grill next to someone infected, but maybe the person upfront at the register won't, assuming the mask does something to some degree. Multiply that out over a whole state over months and you'd see the impact.",nkx6sq,2021-05-26 02:41:26

">**Abstract**

>The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations in the spike (S) protein has raised concern about potential immune escape. Here, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses to wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern in a cohort of 121 BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCW). Twenty-three HCW recovered from mild COVID-19 disease and exhibited a recall response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional antibodies and virus-specific T cells after a single vaccination. Specific immune responses were also detected in seronegative HCW after one vaccination, but a second dose was required to reach high levels of functional antibodies and cellular immune responses in all individuals. Vaccination-induced antibodies cross-neutralized the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functionality against B.1.351 was consistently 2- to 4-fold lower than to the homologous virus. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with peptide pools spanning the mutated S regions of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to detect cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with variants. Importantly, we observed no differences in CD4+ T-cell activation in response to variant antigens, indicating that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins do not escape T-cell-mediated immunity elicited by the wild type S protein. In conclusion, this study shows that some variants can partially escape humoral immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 vaccination, but S-specific CD4+ T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.",nky3sq,2021-05-25 20:37:02

"#Abstract

**Background** 

Although the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have proven high efficacy, limited data exists on the duration of immune responses and their relation to age and side effects.

**Methods**

We studied the antibody and memory T cell responses to Spike protein after the two-dose Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 122 volunteers up to 3 months and correlated the findings with age and side effects.

**Findings**

We found a robust antibody response after the second vaccination dose. However, the antibody levels declined at 6 and 12 weeks postvaccination, indicating a waning of the immune response. Regardless, the average levels remained higher compared to pre-vaccination or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. The antibodies efficiently blocked ACE2 receptor binding to Spike protein of four variants of concern at one week but this was decreased at three months, in particular with B.1.351 and P1 isolates. 87% of individuals developed Spike-specific memory T cell responses, which were lower in individuals with increased proportions of immunosenescent CD8+ TEMRA cells. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, suggesting a detrimental impact of age on outcome.

**Interpretation**

The mRNA vaccine induces a strong antibody response to four variants at 1 week postvaccination but decreases thereafter, in particular among older individuals. T cell responses, although detectable in the majority, were lower in individuals with immunosenescence. The deterioration of vaccine response needs to be monitored to define the optimal time for the revaccination.",nl1dl3,2021-05-25 23:11:15

"No. You don't continue to have peak levels of antibodies circulating in your blood for the rest of your life after any infection or vaccination. 

""Regardless, the average levels remained higher compared to pre-vaccination or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals.""

So they still had higher antibody levels than those who had recovered from a covid infection

""87% of individuals developed Spike-specific memory T cell responses""

Plus the majority of vaccinees developed a cellular response (you might be re-infected but the disease would be less severe).

Monitoring like this should gather data on when boosters are likely to be needed. Firstly in the elderly and vulnerable as they have less robust immune responses to begin with, but that certainly doesn't mean that the vaccines are useless.",nl1dl3,2021-05-26 13:49:05

"Abstract
Social distancing remains an important strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. However, the impacts of specific state-level policies on mobility and subsequent COVID-19 case trajectories have not been completely quantified. Using anonymized and aggregated mobility data from opted-in Google users, we found that state-level emergency declarations resulted in a 9.9% reduction in time spent away from places of residence. Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 24.5% reduction in mobility the following week, and subsequent shelter-in-place mandates yielded an additional 29.0% reduction. Decreases in mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth two to four weeks later. For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a 17.5% reduction in case growth two weeks later. Given the continued reliance on social distancing policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, these results may be helpful to public health officials trying to balance infection control with the economic and social consequences of these policies.",nkuccj,2021-05-25 20:39:56
"another study only looking at the first month or two in america.  throw it in the heap.

There's probably something useful in this paper, but i'm not sure its more than that the government told the non-essential workers to stay at home and workplaces obliged.  

&#x200B;

To look further, we saw a large part of the country peak during a 'second' wave in the midwest  prior to the holidays and never have another wave(of signifigance) again.  The mobility is probably night and day different from march 2020 and november 2020 in those states.",nkuccj,2021-05-26 14:48:49
"As the title suggests, the impact is on mobility (first-order) and case growth (second-order). A reduction in mobility is actually more of a lockdown behavior than mere physical distancing. I.e., perhaps more isolation is inversely correlated to case growth (which is intuitive).

One factor that may cloud the data is that the sample size is opted-in Google users. I have NO proof such individuals represent a different psychographic or demographic cohort, but I would guess them to be the most agreeable to such orders; meaning that a state-level emergency declaration resulted in—at best—a 9.9% reduction in mobility (based on my conjecture about personality type).",nkuccj,2021-05-25 22:15:03
"Even with the disclaimers, this is good information and common sense. We can say for sure there is a correlation between social distancing and a reduction in spread. Add masks to the equation and it is likely improved. This will be important to further nail down in the future so we better understand the relationship of such interventions in relation to the spread of airborne infections. Identifying an individual organisms transmission characteristics early in the course of an epidemic/pandemic tied to this kind of information can allow public health to function without political overtones. It isn't opinion, it becomes fact. It is imperative to understand the general descriptive Epi data as quickly as possible with a novel organism.",nkuccj,2021-05-26 12:31:10

"**Abstract**

Two elementary parameters for quantifying viral infection and shedding are viral load and whether samples yield a replicating virus isolate in cell culture. We examined 25,381 German SARS-CoV-2 cases, including 6110 from test centres attended by pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly-symptomatic (PAMS) subjects, 9519 who were hospitalised, and 1533 B.1.1.7 lineage infections. The youngest had mean log10 viral load 0.5 (or less) lower than older subjects and an estimated ~78% of the peak cell culture replication probability, due in part to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 109 copies per swab were found in 8% of subjects, one-third of whom were PAMS, with mean age 37.6. We estimate 4.3 days from onset of shedding to peak viral load (8.1) and cell culture isolation probability (0.75). B.1.1.7 subjects had mean log10 viral load 1.05 higher than non-B.1.1.7, with estimated cell culture replication probability 2.6 times higher.",nksvo7,2021-05-25 20:04:17

"I am not an expert of virology, which is for sure the target audience of this paper, so I am sure missing a lot of this abstract, but I'll try.

They took samples from people of all ages and determined the amount of viral RNA. They compared the viral load of young children and adults. Adults had a mean load 3 times (10^0.5) as high, which they deemed not to be significant. 8% of the subjects had especially high viral loads. [A possible explanation for super-spreading events] They also compared people with B.1.1.7 with people infected with other types. The B.1.1.7 infected people had a mean load 11 times has high as non-B.1.1.7 infected people. [A possible explanation for more infectious B.1.1.7]

Btw. there is a new preprint about a research of how many droplets children and adults produce depending on breathing, talking singing. So even a droplet contains the same number of viruses there can still be a difference between children and adults. Unfortunately the paper seems to be in German, but you can find also articles about it in English language news.

"Abstract

COVID-19 pneumonia has specific features and outcomes that suggests a unique immunopathogenesis. Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status. Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days. Among hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, COVID-19 is independently associated with higher NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) and lower apolipoprotein E and HDL concentrations. These features might act as mediators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and emerge as new therapeutic targets. Further investigations are required to define the role of NEFAs in the pathogenesis and the dysregulated immune response associated with COVID-19.",nl6cz9,2021-05-26 03:36:32

"Cancer patients, in particular patients with hematological malignancies, are at increased risk for critical illness upon COVID-19. We here assessed antibody as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in unexposed and SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer patients to characterize SARS-CoV 2 immunity and to identify immunological parameters contributing to COVID-19 outcome. Unexposed patients with hematological malignancies presented with reduced prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4+ T cell responses and signs of T cell exhaustion when compared to solid tumor patients and healthy volunteers. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses did not differ between COVID-19 cancer patients and healthy volunteers, intensity, expandability, and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses were profoundly reduced in cancer patients, and the latter associated with a severe course of COVID-19. This identifies impaired SARS-CoV-2 T cell immunity as potential determinant for dismal outcome of COVID-19 in cancer patients.",nkth6u,2021-05-25 17:15:08

">NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the first enrolled subjects have received their immunizations as part of a new study in adults ages 65 or older exploring the coadministration of the company’s 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) candidate following a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, currently authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The primary objective in the trial is to describe safety when both vaccines are co-administered, with follow up six months after vaccination. Secondary objectives are to describe immune responses produced by each of the vaccines.

>The trial will include 600 adults who will be recruited from the pivotal Phase 3 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine trial and will have received their second dose of the vaccine at least six months prior to entering the coadministration study. The participants are being randomized to one of three groups:

> * 20vPnC plus Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster, which is a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 
> * 20vPnC plus placebo 
> * Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster plus placebo",njxo6u,2021-05-24 14:43:34

"Abstract

The current SARS-CoV-2 has put significant strain on healthcare services worldwide due to acute COVID-19. However, the potential long-term effects of this infection haven’t been extensively discussed.

We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to cause persistent infection in some individuals, and should this be the case, that in a few years we may see a rise in cancer incidence due to carcinogenic effects of this coronavirus.

Non-retroviral RNA viruses such as Coronaviridae have been shown to cause persistent infection in hosts. Empirical evidence of viral genomic material shedding weeks after apparent clinical and laboratorial resolution of COVID-19 may be an indirect proof for persistent viral infection. Furthermore, tropism towards certain immune-privileged territories may facilitate immune evasion by this virus.

Structural homology with SARS-CoV-1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to directly impair pRb and p53, which are key gatekeepers with tumor suppressor functions. Additionally, COVID-19 features preeminent inflammatory response with marked oxidative stress, which acts as both as initiator and promotor of carcinogenesis.

Should there be a carcinogenic risk associated with SARS-CoV-2, the implications for public health are plenty, as infected patients should be closely watched during long periods of follow-up.

Additional investigation to establish or exclude the possibility for persistent infection is paramount to identify and prevent possible complications in the future.",nk9lv3,2021-05-24 23:03:44
"This my very weak understanding of a supporting [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3318636/) of theirs. 

This paper postulates that there’s some sort of effect when part of SARS-COV-1 meets pRB (tumor suppressing protein).

What I’m understanding is that there is an inhibition/reduction of pRB going on when the endoribonuclease nsp15 and pRB interact (in vitro). The paper says that a pRB nsp15 interaction causes about a 3-to-4 fold decrease in pRB levels compared to the control. And, nsp15 seems to use pRB for stabilization. I’m not sure at what point this reduction needs to be worried about but yeah. 

And as you know, the paper I originally posted claimed the possibility of this behavior appearing in SARS-COV-2 due to the structural similarity. 

I haven’t looked at these observations in vivo.
As a layman, I really do hope we don’t have to worry about this though.",nk9lv3,2021-05-25 04:54:10

">**Abstract**

>**Background**: Vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination in humans has not been determined. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are a useful model for demonstrating whether mRNA-1273 mediates protection against B.1.351.

>**Methods**: Nonhuman primates received 30 or 100 microgram of mRNA-1273 as a prime-boost vaccine at 0 and 4 weeks, a single immunization of 30 microgram at week 0, or no vaccine. Antibody and T cell responses were assessed in blood, bronchioalveolar lavages (BAL), and nasal washes. Viral replication in BAL and nasal swabs were determined by qRT-PCR for sgRNA, and histopathology and viral antigen quantification were performed on lung tissue post-challenge.

>**Results**: Eight weeks post-boost, 100 microgram x2 of mRNA-1273 induced reciprocal ID50 neutralizing geometric mean titers against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B.1.351 of 3300 and 240, respectively, and 430 and 84 for the 30 microgram x2 group. There were no detectable neutralizing antibodies against B.1351 after the single immunization of 30 microgram. On day 2 following B.1.351 challenge, sgRNA in BAL was undetectable in 6 of 8 NHP that received 100 microgram x2 of mRNA-1273, and there was a ~2-log reduction in sgRNA in NHP that received two doses of 30 microgram compared to controls. In nasal swabs, there was a 1-log10 reduction observed in the 100 microgram x2 group. There was limited inflammation or viral antigen in lungs of vaccinated NHP post-challenge.

>**Conclusions**: Immunization with two doses of mRNA-1273 achieves effective immunity that rapidly controls lower and upper airway viral replication against the B.1.351 variant in NHP.",nka2zw,2021-05-24 23:24:00
Interesting considering the Pfizer vaccine is 30ug. BioNTech must have a better overall design.,nka2zw,2021-05-25 06:58:37
"I wouldn’t read too much into it. Moderna basically decided to go for the highest dose that their subjects would tolerate. Pfizer and BNT decided to go for the lowest dose that appeared to provide adequate immunity. I think it’s important to remember that these were decisions that were being made in April of last year when it wasn’t even clear if a vaccine against coronavirus could even work.

Basically, the two companies decided to risk opposite ends of the envelope. Moderno decided to risk an unacceptable side effect profile, while BNT decided to risk inadequate efficacy.  Fortunately, neither of those risks came to pass. It’s also important to understand that the adaptive immune response is a complex system. Below a certain threshold, an antigen dose won’t generate a response. There is a narrow window where the response is dose-dependent, And then above that window the response occurs and is not dose-dependent.  That’s why the same dose of the vaccine can be given to patients who are vastly different sizes and still be equally effective.",nka2zw,2021-05-25 15:46:10

"They are indeed totally different. BioNTech 5'UTR and 3'UTR are more optimized (for stability mostly), the Poly(A) tail as well (using [this trick](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/25/4/507.long)). It is totally possible that 30ug of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine produces as much or more spike proteins than 100ug of Moderna's vaccine. 

Moderna has been focused on the delivery mechanism lately, they published some cool articles about their LNPs, like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253119300174#!). We know more about its biodegradability, tropism and so on. The lipid used by Pfizer (Acuitas ALC-0315) ain't that different though, maybe the main differences are due to the necessity to stay far enough from Moderna's patents. 

That said, both vaccines work similarly and they seem to perform as well.",nka2zw,2021-05-25 21:28:49

"Summary

>Antibodies against the receptor-binding-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal-domain (NTD) induced the open conformation of receptor binding domain (RBD) and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2 and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the NTD. Structural analysis demonstrated that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies bound to NTD in a similar manner. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected at high levels in severe patients. Moreover, we identified antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site in uninfected donors, albeit at a lower frequency. These findings demonstrate that not only neutralizing antibodies but also enhancing antibodies are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",nk8ydd,2021-05-24 22:30:41

"Cleverness has nothing to do with it. In any event, we see no actual clinical evidence of antibody dependent enhancement in COVID-19. The value of this study is that it demonstrates a way in which coronaviruses could exhibit antibody dependent enhancement. It could inform us on how to make vaccines that do not have this possibility at all. That said, the actual clinical and epidemiological evidence that we have is that our current vaccines do not exhibit an enhancement issue.

I will point out that the jawed vertebrate adaptive immune system has been handling viruses for hundreds of millions of years. Although antibody dependent enhancement has been observed, this is actually a really uncommon feature of viral infections.

Jawed vertebrates Produce vast polyclonal antibody responses to viruses. Presumably, part of the “reason” for this is to avoid issues exactly like this (As much as phenomena in biology have “reasons”)",nk8ydd,2021-05-25 16:53:50

>In this study, we found a non-canonical, Fc receptor-independent ADE mechanism.

It involves certain antibodies binding to 2 spike proteins in such a way as to force the RBD to its open conformation, increasing ACE2 binding and therefore infectivity.

"Abstract

Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited against the receptor-binding site (RBS) of the spike protein of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 are generally less effective against recent variants of concern. RBS residues E484, K417 and N501 are mutated in variants first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). We analyzed their effects on ACE2 binding and K417N and E484K mutations on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2), which can both bind the RBS in alternate binding modes, are abrogated by K417N, E484K, or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However, nAbs to the more conserved, cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies.",nk418x,2021-05-24 19:00:20

"**Abstract**  
*The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a surge in research exploring all aspects of the virus and its effects on human health. The overwhelming publication rate means that researchers are unable to keep abreast of the literature. To ameliorate this, we present the CoronaCentral resource that uses machine learning to process the research literature on SARS-CoV-2 together with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We categorize the literature into useful topics and article types and enable analysis of the contents, pace, and emphasis of research during the crisis with integration of Altmetric data. These topics include therapeutics, disease forecasting, as well as growing areas such as “long COVID” and studies of inequality. This resource, available at https://coronacentral.ai, is updated daily.*

Pretty cool move from the National Academy of Sciences, I do wonder how much better this is than a useful working knowledge of how to use google scholar, if at all. That said, I'm sure there are a fair amount of practitioners who would benefit from a resource like this, especially in a clinical setting, who are perhaps not as familiar with GS.",nju3o3,2021-05-24 14:39:57

"ABSTRACT 

Critically ill 2019 coronavirus disease patients (COVID-19) under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are 10- to 40-times more likely to die than the general population. Although progression from mild to severe COVID-19 has been associated with hypoxia, uncontrolled inflammation and coagulopathy, the mechanisms involved in progression to severity are poorly understood. By analyzing the virome from tracheal aspirates (TA) of 25 COVID-19 patients under IMV, we found higher levels and differential expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) genes compared to nasopharyngeal swabs from mild cases and TA from non-COVID patients. Proteomic analysis and RT-PCR confirmed the presence of HERV-K in these patients. Moreover, increased HERV-K expression was triggered in human primary monocytes from healthy donors after experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In critically ill patients, higher HERV-K levels were associated with early mortality (within 14 days) in the intensive care unit. Increased HERV-K expression in deceased patients associated with IL-17-related inflammation, monocyte activation and higher consumption of clotting/fibrinolysis factors. Our data implicate the levels of HERV-K transcripts in the outcome of critical COVID-19 patients under invasive mechanical ventilation.",njl875,2021-05-24 01:26:19
"We do know that prolonged inflammation and cellular stress can reactivate dormant HIV provirus, so this isn’t entirely shocking.

I’m just left wondering if there is any clinical application.  There doesn’t need to be; sometimes just knowing something for the sake of knowing it and not having an application in mind is good enough.

After all, the people who first cloned the *Pfu* and *Taq* polymerases probably had no idea that one day these enzymes would be invaluable tools in PCR and site-directed mutagenesis.",njl875,2021-05-24 04:43:02
How likely is it that the HERV-K is contributing to disease? It makes sense but I'm also reminded of  latent viruses like herpes that tend to flare up when the immune system is challenged with something else. (I.e. Cold sores are associated with colds but don't make them worse),njl875,2021-05-24 15:24:21

Meh... They seem to be implying causation when all they see is correlation.  HERV-K reactivation is more likely to a be a consequence of failing immune function than the reason for covid progression.,njl875,2021-05-24 16:56:01

"I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are regarding yesterday's PHE report on B.1.651.2, it says two things:

* The first is obvious, that the new variant has won over the previously dominant variant B.1.1.7 (it's now more than 60% of sequenced positive tests), and is the new dominant variant in England. (And, by implication, the rest of the UK, but that's outside PHE's remit.)

* The second is that it appears to be 67% more transmissible, which is higher than the worst-case estimates from last week.

See Table 5: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990177/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_13_England.pdf

There's still a high probability this is a statistical quirk (e.g. it's spreading in communities with different levels of prior immunity/vaccination rates), but the longer this goes on the less likely that would explain it (because it's spreading wider and the profiles of the cases will average out).

The UK media have picked this up this morning, and are making the usual dog's dinner out of it. But I notice this doesn't seem to have rung any alarm bells in other countries. So whilst the UK media are probably over-reporting it, the world media are under reporting it? If the implied transmission advantage is actually that high, given how transmissible B.1.1.7 was compared to previous variants, then this is really quite dangerous for everywhere that has low built-up immunity?

The good news is the vaccines do seem to be working, although PHE decline to give an update to their estimates from last week, they hint they'll do that next week. They have provided some raw data however, see Table 3b. It shows cases/hospitalisations/deaths by vaccination status. For reference the approximate vaccine coverage (for adults) in the UK is: 25% unvaccinated; 30% one dose; 45% two doses[0]. These are very strongly correlated with age too, the two dose cohort are almost all 55 years old or higher (with some younger who are deemed vulnerable). The one dose cohort are 30-55. And the unvaccinated are almost exclusively 18 to 30 years old, with some vaccine hesitancy in older age groups. Those numbers, in that context, look very positive to me. I won't link, because Twitter, but a level-headed statistician ran the numbers and reckons that equates to ~98% efficacy against death after two doses. But that's just one estimate based on one data set.

[0] - but, of course, vaccine coverage would have been lower at earlier points in time. But given the growth rate those cases are heavily weighted to occurring at the more recent end of the range.",njwaut,2021-05-28 08:31:34
"I apologize if this isn’t totally science related, being somewhat about public health policy changes.

It took a long time for most health authorities to recognize aerosol/airborne/small-droplet transmission, while evidence seemed to be coming in very early on. What reasons were there for the reluctance to recognize the possibility?

As a non-scientist, there were a few pretty blatant clues that large droplets and fomites weren’t the only culprit: presymptomatic/asymptomatic transmission, superspreader events, indoor vs outdoor transmission, and so on. Would those have been explainable by large droplet transmission?

"[Yesterday's CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e3.htm) states that 2% of the breakthrough cases they tracked resulted in death. This seems high - I thought the IFR for covid overall was under 2%, and I thought breakthrough cases were overall less severe than cases of covid in the unvaccinated? I realize we're probably undercounting asymptomatic breakthrough cases, but then, we're probably undercounting asymptomatic cases in unvaccinated people too.

This is not an antivaxx question, I swear, I'm fully vaccinated and glad of it and I believe it when people say breakthrough cases are normally less severe, I'm just not understanding the math here.",njwaut,2021-05-27 06:10:23

The article even mentioned they weren't using the 2020-2021 flu season because there ""was no flu season"" this year. So um, that seems like terrible math because you're comparing the absolute risk between years with totally different rates of transmission of viral illness. There has to be a better way to do this.

"I see the first results for Vaccine mixing are out from a small Spanish study. AZ followed by a second Pfizer dose.

The messenger RNA still carries the same instructions, it still has an expected half-life of 6 months, it is still expected to become part of nuclear DNA via reverse transcriptase, it still signals the DNA to get its mRNA to go to the ribosomes and translate for S protein production, your immune system will still attack your own cells en masse and any and all S proteins that they encounter, which means you will have significantly less anti-coagulation pathway facilitators, which means increased risk of clotting/thrombosis, it will still make it so there are not enough S proteins extracellularly, so that cells undergoing apoptosis just stay there and break down, destroying satellite cells.

"After seeing the Norway bus-trip data, Diamond Princess, and contact tracing data from South Korea, it was already clear to me and to several of my colleagues in mid-March that aerosol transmission was a major (or predominant) form of spread. Politics, vague terminology, stubbornness or downright incompetency got in the way and authorities acknowledged it many months later. Some still don't even mention aerosols. 

There are several interesting studies/reviews about influenza transmission:

J&J took a gamble and bet that they could achieve efficacy with a single dose.

Vaccines do seem to circumvent this faulty priming, for all I can tell they do seem to ablate it entirely, thus preventing ""long covid"".

The answer to your second question is that we're not sure.  Early indications from the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines are that they greatly reduce the ability of vaccinated people to spread the virus, but data is still being gathered.  The CDC says, under their ""what we know"" heading, that ""COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of people spreading COVID-19.""

J&J had to bin 15 million doses after the manufacturing plant accidentally mixed up the ingredients of it and the AZ vaccine that that facility was also producing.

As soon as it is statistically possible, the numbers of infection between the two groups are compared. If, say, Pfizer is described as 94% effective against symptomatic disease, that means that the participants in the Pfizer group got 6 symptomatic infections for every 100 in the control group.

>it still has an expected half-life of 6 months

>it is still expected to become part of nuclear DNA via reverse transcriptase

""They do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.  
mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.  
The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions."" source: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html)

>, it still signals the DNA to get its mRNA to go to the ribosomes and translate for S protein production,

This is smart-sounding biology words that are irrelevant to the discussion.

> your immune system will still attack your own cells en masse and any and all S proteins that they encounter,

""The vaccine will cause the body to mount an immune response"" is a less scary way of saying that, which is exactly what every vaccine does.  ""any and all"" and ""en masse"" are just scare words, they aren't an accurate or useful representation of what's happening.

>which means you will have significantly less anti-coagulation pathway facilitators

This is a concrete claim that could be tested for.  Whoever you're getting this from should supply the study their citing for this claim.

>which means increased risk of clotting/thrombosis

Last I looked (which was admittedly a few weeks ago), the data on thrombosis in vaccine recipients looked as if there was no or minimal risk above background.  I could be wrong now that more time has passed and more data has been gathered, but I guarantee that this is over-stating the magnitude of risk.

This webinar was posted by the CDC back in January. https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2021/callinfo_012821.asp

Clinics have been created to specifically identify and treat PASC. 

I've been hearing that it is still being understood for too long. At this point there should be an agreed upon definition with inclusion criteria for use across studies. Could we not make it an evolving definition that could update as needed? It doesn't seem right to just keep saying, well we can't do research on it since we don't agree on what to include. Even the vaccination studies had their own definitions for mild, moderate and severe covid cases yet were able to complete the studies. Let's move forward, create a list of symptoms to include, make sure that is clearly stated in methods and gather the data. 

Personally, it irks me that many of the studies I've read about long covid / long hauler / PASC show percent of people with ""symptoms"" persisting for x amount of time without separating out which symptoms persisted. So if I got to design a study I would provide a chart of each symptom organized by category and separated by objective vs subjective measures plus change in daily functioning and provide the percent of people that had those symptoms for different units of time. I'd love to see that data gathered for people who were unvaccinated and had mild, moderate and severe infection, and those who caught covid after being fully vaccinated. Then separate all that by age groups. Ideally this data would be gathered by the individuals' healthcare providers and at long covid clinics not just one hospital medical records of people admitted for covid or by survey. I realize this is a massive undertaking that would require cooperation between different agencies. Maybe a system like VAERS. Maybe it could be organized by the CDC in the US and other such agencies in other countries. Maybe it's just one group to put the request out to doctors, gather and an analyze the data then present it.

"Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by acute clinical pathologies, including various coagulopathies that may be accompanied by hypercoagulation and platelet hyperactivation.
 Recently, a new COVID-19 phenotype has been noted in patients after they have ostensibly recovered from acute COVID-19 symptoms. This new syndrome is commonly termed Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Here we refer to it as Long COVID/PASC. Lingering symptoms persist for as much as 6 months (or longer) after acute infection, where COVID-19 survivors complain of recurring fatigue or muscle weakness, being out of breath, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. 

Given that blood clots can block microcapillaries and thereby inhibit oxygen exchange, we here investigate if the lingering symptoms that individuals with Long COVID/PASC manifest might be due to the presence of persistent circulating plasma clots that are resistant to fibrinolysis. We use techniques including proteomics and fluorescence microscopy to study plasma samples from healthy individuals, individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with acute COVID-19, and those with Long COVID/PASC symptoms. 

We show that plasma samples from Long COVID/PASC still contain large anomalous (amyloid) deposits. We also show that these anomalous deposits in both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC plasma samples are resistant to fibrinolysis (compared to plasma from controls and T2DM), even after trypsinisation. After a second trypsinization, the persistent pellet deposits were solubilized. We detected various inflammatory molecules that are substantially increased in both the supernatant and trapped in the solubilized pellet deposits of acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC, versus the equivalent volume of fully digested fluid of the control samples. Of particular interest was a substantial increase in α(2)-antiplasmin (α2AP), various fibrinogen chains, as well as Serum Amyloid A (SAA) that were trapped in the solubilized fibrinolytic-resistant pellet deposits. 

Clotting pathologies in both acute COVID-19 infection and in Long COVID/PASC might therefore benefit from following a regime of continued anticlotting therapy to support the fibrinolytic system function.",njrh2q,2021-05-24 08:28:41

"“National vaccine effectiveness monitoring shows a reduction in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection after 1 dose of vaccine for B.1.617.2 compared to B.1.1.7 (moderate confidence). Current data suggest this is an absolute reduction of approximately 20% after 1 dose.

Vaccine effectiveness is higher and similar between variants after 2 doses with a possible small reduction for B.1.617.2 (low confidence).

Although this is observational data subject to some biases, it holds true across several analytic approaches, is consistent with observed outbreaks, and is supported by pseudovirus and live virus neutralisation data. There are no data on whether prevention of transmission is affected. There are insufficient data on vaccine effectiveness against severe disease. Based on neutralisation data, vaccines are expected to remain effective against severe disease. “",nj6f3q,2021-05-23 13:05:22

"This is from Public Health England.

>**Abstract**

>**Background**

>The B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant has contributed to the surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the UK. We estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19
vaccines against this variant.

>**Methods**

>A test negative case control design was used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases identified based on sequencing and S-gene target status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England
was used to estimate the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status.

>**Results**

>Effectiveness was notably lower after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3) compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results for both vaccines. With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from
93.4% (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2. Sequenced cases detected after 1 or 2 doses of vaccination had higher odds of infection with
B.1.617.2 compared to unvaccinated cases (OR 1.40; 95%CI: 1.13-1.75).

>**Conclusions**

>After 2 doses of either vaccine there were only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2 variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with 2 doses among vulnerable groups.",nisup6,2021-05-22 22:44:30
"> Cases were identified as B.1.617.2 through sequencing or if they were S-gene target positive on the TaqPath PCR assay. Cases were identified as B.1.1.7 on sequencing or if they were S-gene target negative on the TaqPath PCR assay.  

> [...]  

> Among sequenced samples that tested S gene positive 72.2% were B.1.617.2 in April 2021 and 93.0% were B.1.617.2 in May (as of 12 May 2021)  

So in some cases the variant responsible for infection was determined not by sequencing but by S-gene target positivity/negativity in PCR. The other S positive sequences at that time in the UK seem to have mostly been due to B.1.617.1 and B.1.351. If I remember correctly, the former was shown to have similar ability to evade antibodies as B.1.617.2. But B.1.351 is known to have a significant effect on vaccine effectiveness. The number of B.1.351 cases that were S-positive and not sequenced was probably too small to affect results of this study, but I'm surprised this is not discussed at all in the preprint.",nisup6,2021-05-23 00:16:13

Edit: why am I being downvoted? This is the passage in question. Some countries such as the UK and Canada have pursued a single dose strategy, so this is pretty germane. I couldn’t find the section where they specified if they included cases that happened within two weeks after vaccination when calculating effectiveness.

"Different methodologies for working it out.

The biggest difference according to Meaghan Kall, one of the epidemiologists at Public Health England (the body that produced both the 66% and 85-90% reports) is that this new report today included more people who had only had the AZ vaccine recently. The 85-90% is an estimate for longer-term protection.

(Source: her Twitter account, which I can't link as Twitter links are banned)

Exact quote:

> To ppl asking why vaccine effectiveness for 2nd dose AZ in B.1.617.2 analysis differs from the summary table published this week: 
>
> - AZ 2nd dose after 28 days is 66% 
> - AZ 2nd dose after 12 weeks is 85-90%

Although reading that back it sounds like she's talking about the dosing strategy, but the context of the discussion made it sound like ""time since second dose"".

As always, it's probably best to wait for these things to be corroborated by multiple sources. The document that contained the 85-90% claim is updated on a weekly basis too, so it'll be worth keeping an eye on as the mix of variants change.

EDIT: since writing this comment the above tweet was clarified as “time before follow-up” rather than time between doses. Which sounds like good news as it should mean 60/66% is the lower bound and over time the gap to Pfizer narrows.

> Rollout of 2nd dose of AZ was later than Pfizer
>
> In the analysis, most (74%) AZ people had only recently (past 28 days) had their 2nd doses, vs less than half (46%) of Pfizer - ergo half had it more than 28 days ago",nisup6,2021-05-23 08:49:42
"Different study parameters. Real world efficacy does seem to indicate something better than 66%, or 66% efficacy is really all that’s needed to greatly curb transmission.",nisup6,2021-05-23 08:48:10
"The UK started speeding up second doses as soon as they realized they were dealing with the Indian variant (they're at 30%+ fully vaccinated now). Those numbers seem to be consistent with other studies I've seen. [Some studies](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.21254882v1) have suggested that [first doses are not as effective against the variants](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/220613/prior-sars-cov-2-infection-boosts-response-variants/). But the numbers for one dose have been all over the place since the start, even for Covid classic (I've seen them go anywhere between [46%/57%](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765?query=featured_home) and 92% for Covid classic and the UK variant). So it makes sense that this range would be lower for variants that are considered more vaccine resistant (e.g. B.1.351 and B.1.617).

> Some countries such as the UK and Canada have pursued a single dose strategy, so this is pretty germane.

You're probably thinking about [this study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.21254882v2). The odds of infection with B.1.351 after 2 doses were higher than in unvaccinated controls. And that was specifically with tozinameran (the Pfizer vaccine).,nisup6,2021-05-23 00:29:21

BioNTech's CEO recently said that they expect Pfizer to be 70-75% effective against the Indian Variant (so roughly the same level of efficiency as B.1.351). There was recently an outbreak in Singapore where a large number of fully vaccinated people contracted the virus, but still significantly less than those who were unvaccinated.  My understanding is that out of those who got infected around 300 were unvaccinated and 78 were fully vaccinated, which seems to be in line with Pfizer's estimate, possibly a bit higher, but still significantly lower than 90%.",nisup6,2021-05-24 07:38:38

"ELI5: Each time a virion replicates itself, there's a very small chance of a mutation in its RNA. Whenever that happens, there's also a small chance that it will be more infectious, or for longer, or with fewer symptoms... which over time will make it more prevalent over other variants by simple selection pressure.",nisup6,2021-05-23 05:36:30
"In addition to the actual mechanism of change that /u/Slackbeing referenced, it's also the virus having extended bouts with the human immune system in immunocompromised individuals. Those individuals' weakened immune response provides an opportunity those small changes get to build and refine over a period of time much greater than with people who have healthy immune systems, and may even give an opportunity for selection pressure to foster beneficial (for the virus) mutations. That's a popular theory on why so many variants share so many of the same mutations (compared to the wild type virus), despite genealogical and geographical separation.",nisup6,2021-05-23 06:38:07
"I'll try to explain it a bit more thoroughly: world-wide trillions of cells are being infected by the virus, each of these cells goes through the same cycle:
- an intact virus uses a mechanism to enter the healthy cell
- within the cell the virus falls apart and leaves its genes to be copied by the cells copying machines
- the cell copies hundreds of virus copies: virus genes and proteins
- those parts get reassembled by the cells assembly lines and form new virus copies 
- the new virus copies get released and the cell dies

Within the cycle of copying the genes errors occur and a lot of mutations are being created -> copies of the virus emerge that aren't exact copies but that differ in some way. The vast majority of these mutations make the virus less capable. They are disabled so to speak and will thus have a much lower chance to spread than the other copies without that mutation.

There is a very small chance though that one of those random mutations actually improves one of the abilities of the virus and will thus lead to copies of the virus that are better than the others at spreading through the human society. These are the emerging variants of concern like B1.1.7 (""the British variant"").

Among the different ""abilities"" the virus has that can be altered through mutation, are things such as:
- getting into the cell faster / more reliably
- being more stable for longer (in the air / on surfaces) so that chances of spreading are higher
But also being harder to detect by the immune system. And specifically being harder to detect by the immune system of a vaccinated individual. This is a concern because there might be a possibility of a variant emerging that is unaffected by the existing vaccines and that could basically start a whole new covid wave within countries that had already gotten rid of covid for a while through vaccinations.",nisup6,2021-05-23 07:36:49

"Given 90% of people in the UK who have been fully vaccinated got vaccinated within the last two months, 88% effectiveness at peak performance for a variant not thought to be particularly good at evading vaccines does make me worry about the effectiveness after 6/12 months against variants like 617.2 and 351. Especially if there is a synergistic effect of variant vaccine evasion mutations and vaccination effects waning with time (I don't know if such a synergy exists or not). Looking at the moderna booster study, it seems after \~6months, the ID50 for the WT virus decreased to 1/3rd of the peak, but b.1.351 decreased to 1/25th of the peak ID50 for the WT and P.1 ID50 was down to about 1/20th. 

I'm only a layman at looking at that data, but it seems that without a booster, a big proportion of people are going to be below the threshold for strong immunity against the variants within 6-12months without a booster.  B.1.617.2 vaccine avoidance might not be much of a concern by itself, but if it has double the transmissibility of the WT strain (I don't think there is good data on this yet?), then even small drops in vaccine efficacy still could be problematic. For example (using made up numbers for demonstration purposes), if R0=3 for the WT and 6 for B.1.617.2, you'd still need to cut the number of unvaccinated people in half to get back-to-normal full-herd immunity even if vaccines were perfect (\~33% vs \~17%). If the vaccine is only 82% effective against B.1.617.2 (or a related variant with similar transmissibility) after 6 months, then even 100% vaccination might not be enough to get full herd immunity for pre-covid behavioral patterns.

I certainly don't have the knowledge to try to make any definitive claims. I hope we'll have boosters available by the end of the year, so the answers to those questions don't really matter. But I can see why some would have concern about our future when mask requirements are being made illegal when only 40% of people are fully vaccinated (and vaccination rates are plummeting) in some places while variants like 617.2 and 351 are still growing concerns...",nisup6,2021-05-23 08:39:19

Follow up time on the Pfizer doses was longer as well than for AZ which likely has an impact.

"The UK started administering the AZ vaccine in January, and adopted the 12-week dosing interval within days of starting the rollout. How many people would of had 24-weeks from 1st jab to reach 90%? A tiny fraction of those who have received both doses. Need more clarification on this >90% vaccine efficacy figure. PHE officials need to be more precise when Tweeting out information to the general public.",nisup6,2021-05-23 14:43:34
"The wording of the tweet was confused, the authors of the report have clarified what they meant since. They meant the latter (time since second dose) rather than the former (time between doses).

Whether or not or the numbers match the predictions when more data becomes available, only time will tell.

The 85-90% figure comes from Public Health England's weekly vaccine surveillance report: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988193/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_20.pdf and since this is weekly it'll be interesting to see how it varies over time.

Interestingly both of these reports (the weekly one, and the one testing different variants) are produced by Public Health England and seem to use the same data sources. The methodology beyond that is different though. The methodology of the surveillance study (the weekly one) is described here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974300/COVID-19_vaccine_surveillance_strategy_March21.pdf but it reads very similar to the methodology of the variant efficacy study.

> Routine COVID-19 testing data through Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 is available through the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS). This will be linked to vaccination data from the NIMS. This provides a dataset for monitoring vaccine effectiveness using a test-negative case control approach by vaccine, age group, clinical co-morbidities and different dosing schedules that may be used in the programme.

vs.

> COVID-19 PCR testing in the UK is undertaken through hospital and public health laboratories, as well as community testing through drive through or home testing which is available to anyone with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (high temperature, new continuous cough, loss or change in sense of smell or taste). All positive PCR tests between 26 October 2020 and 16 May 2021 were extracted. All negative community tests among individuals reporting symptoms were also extracted for the test negative case control analysis.

i.e. they both use Pillar 1 and 2 data (the second doesn't explicitly say-so, but what it describes is what is covered by Pillar 1 and 2) as a proxy for symptomatic disease, and both use NIMS for vaccination status.

The differences (other than the amount of time after the second vaccination) seems to be the time periods of data used (the weekly one only covers the post-vaccine roll-out period), and cohort matching. The 85-90% report compares groups based on age, medical conditions, etc., whereas the 60-66% report only compares vaccinated vs. all unvaccinated.

"You put *way* too much thought into this. First of all, the discussion here is about 617 which basically has, according to that study very, very little immune escape capability. We’re not talking about 135. You can’t extrapolate data from 135 and apply it here, and even then efficacy for mRNA vaccines against that variant is still 75% against *asymptomatic infection*., and as far as I know its not growing anywhere meaningfully. You extrapolated waaaay to much from a 3% drop in efficacy. The difference between efficacy against 617 for the Pfizer vaccine and that vaccines efficacy 6 months out from a second dose is so minor it’s nearly irrelevant, efficacy is factoring in things like transmissibility.

 And your doomsday scenario just doesn’t make any sense. The UK is closing in on pre covid life, and if we choose to believe that AZ is 66% effective (and not 90% like a study a couple of days ago) then it would indicate that a vaccine that’s 66% effective is really all that’s needed.

Both analyses used a test-negative case-control (TNCC) design in which vaccinated individuals getting a covid test are compared to unvaccinated individuals getting tested in the same period; and both used similar adjustments for covariates in their statistical models.

So no-one was expecting uniform performance, and there's no significant change from the basis those models were produced.. in terms of second doses anyway... the assumptions for first dose protection are way more optimistic than this study suggests.

Imperial did also model a ""VOC"" scenario. This had AstraZeneca efficacy dropping to 10%, that clearly doesn't apply to this variant based on this results.

It would have been interesting to hear about whether or not the infections were symptomatic. They talk about the immunity being protective, but it is my opinion that protection isn't the ability to prevent positive PCR tests.

I'd be curious if we wouldn't find way more PCR-positive cases if we followed a group of people with a prior infection or who has been infected and we tested them every single day, because we'd greatly increase the odds of catching a viral exposure and some replications before it's gotten under control by the immune system. We are very limited by what we can observe with the tools we have; perhaps that in an ideal world, we'd get a better idea of the viral load present, for how long it is present, how far it has spread, etc, and that we'd have a less binary approach to the notion of what it is to be infected.",nit7le,2021-05-24 14:02:52

"How much of that is that university students were infected with a low enough viral load (Edit: not initially, but upon testing, after developing symptoms a couple days later) so as to not trigger the same kind of immune response as the vaccine?

In other words, if we did the same study for 65+ with one co-morbidity, would we find a lower risk of re-infection because the ultimate viral load of the initial infection was so much higher that it triggered a much higher immune response?  


Edit to fix a wording problem in the first graph.",nit7le,2021-05-23 08:20:55
"In a way, it could also be more fair to compare two infections to two doses of the vaccine. My point is just that the protocol for the vaccine is highly advantageous (and obviously entirely fine this way). We could also find that an infection + a vaccine ""booster"" is even better, or that one dose of the vaccine followed by exposure to the virus some time later is too.

I think it's fair to say that the vaccine seems like a significantly safer way to gain immunity than an infection, so there's not any debate. It is however interesting to think and know what will happen in terms of immunity assuming covid becomes seasonal; perhaps what matters the most in the end is that the first exposure is from the vaccine, and that subsequent exposures to the virus and whatever variants are the ones circulating make excellent boosters.",nit7le,2021-05-24 14:53:08
"Not an expert by any means but I think you might be right. At least one reason for having vaccines being more efficient could be that they target a more important protein only.

In a typical response to infection your cells will present the viral body split into small pieces semi-randomly. The T-Cells will then attach and perform specialization and cloning should they match the protein and other criteria are ok as well (e.g. the coreceptors etc.).

This means that in a normal infection you might get this ""important spike protein"" recognized similarly to a vaccine but alongside you'll also get others which might be less efficient for neutralization purposes.

So a vaccinated person will get 100% ""spike protein"" T-cells activated while an infected person would possibly get a nice split of various proteins, some of which might not be good enough for neutralization due to bad affinity etc.

This is all highly hypothetical of course, there probably are many other factors at play, some of which we might not understand yet at all.",nit7le,2021-05-23 20:51:36

"Abstract:

Over the past year, numerous studies in the peer reviewed and preprint literature have reported on the virological, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.  To date, 25 studies have investigated and identified SARS-CoV-2-derived T cell epitopes in humans. Here, we review these recent studies, how they were performed, and their findings. We review how epitopes identified throughout the SARS-CoV2 proteome reveal significant correlation between number of epitopes defined and size of the antigen provenance. We also report additional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 human CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitope data compiled from these studies, identifying 1400 different reported SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and revealing discrete immunodominant regions of the virus and epitopes that are more prevalently recognized.  This remarkable breadth of epitope repertoire has implications for vaccine design, crossreactivity and for immune escape by SARS-CoV-2 variants.",niyxb3,2021-05-23 04:23:14

"Abstract

Insufficient blood levels of the neurohormone vitamin D are associated with increased risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Despite the global rollout of vaccinations and promising preliminary results, the focus remains on additional preventive measures to manage COVID-19. Results conflict on vitamin D’s plausible role in preventing and treating COVID-19. We examined the relation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality among the multiethnic population of the United Arab Emirates. Our observational study used data for 522 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the main hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Only 464 of those patients were included for data analysis. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Serum samples immediately drawn at the first hospital visit were used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations through automated electrochemiluminescence. Levels < 12 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and of death. Age was the only other independent risk factor, whereas comorbidities and smoking did not contribute to the outcomes upon adjustment. Sex of patients was not an important predictor for severity or death. Our study is the first conducted in the UAE to measure 25(OH)D levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and confirm the association of levels < 12 ng/mL with COVID-19 severity and mortality",nid0xl,2021-05-22 08:14:11

"Here is an abstract of one such explanation of the link between Vitamin D and immune system function generally:

""Vitamin D metabolizing enzymes and vitamin D receptors are present in many cell types including various immune cells such as antigen-presenting-cells, T cells, B cells and monocytes. In vitro data show that, in addition to modulating innate immune cells, vitamin D also promotes a more tolerogenic immunological status. In vivo data from animals and from human vitamin D supplementation studies have shown beneficial effects of vitamin D on immune function, in particular in the context of autoimmunity. In this review, currently available data are summarized to give an overview of the effects of vitamin D on the immune system in general and on the regulation of inflammatory responses, as well as regulatory mechanisms connected to autoimmune diseases particularly in type 1 diabetes mellitus.""

"**Abstract**

Almost a year after the COVID-19 pandemic had begun, The United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil became the epicenter of new lineages, the Variant of Concern (VOCs), B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, respectively. These VOCs are increasingly associated with enhanced transmissibility, immunity evasion, and mortality. The previous most prevalent lineages in the state of Rio Grande do South (Brazil), B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 were rapidly replaced by P.1 and P.2, two B.1.1.28-derived lineages harboring the E484K mutation. To perform a genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients from the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil), in this second pandemic wave, we sequenced viral samples from patients of this region to: (i) identify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the region, the state and bordering countries/states, (ii) characterize the mutation spectra, and (iii) hypothesize possible viral dispersal routes by using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. As results, we not only confirmed that 96.4% of the samples belonged to the P.1 lineage but also that approximately 20% of which could be assigned as the newer P.1.2 (a P.1 derived new sublineage harboring new signature substitutions recently described and present in other Brazilian states and foreign countries). Moreover, P.1 sequences from this study were allocated in several distinct branches (four clades and five clusters) of the P.1 phylogeny, suggesting multiple introductions of P.1 in Rio Grande do Sul still in 2020 and placing this state as a potential core of diffusion and emergence of P.1-derived clades. It is still uncertain if the emergence of P.1.2 and other P.1 clades are related to further virological, clinical, or epidemiological consequences. However, the clear signs of viral molecular diversification from recently introduced P.1 warrant further genomic surveillance.",nin4ch,2021-05-22 18:06:10

"Objective

The relationship between specific humidity and influenza/SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands is evaluated over time and at regional level.

Design

Parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the relationship between humidity and influenza, using five years of weekly data. Bayesian spatio-temporal models—with a Poisson and a Gaussian likelihood—are estimated to find the relationship between regional humidity and the daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the municipalities and provinces of the Netherlands.

Results

An inverse (negative) relationship is observed between specific humidity and the incidence of influenza between 2015 and 2019. The space-time analysis indicates that an increase of specific humidity of one gram of water vapor per kilogram of air (1 g/kg) is related to a reduction of approximately 5% in the risk of COVID-19 infections.

Conclusions

The increase in humidity during the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands may have helped to reduce the risk of regional COVID-19 infections. Policies that lead to an increase in household specific humidity to over 6g/Kg will help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2",nii36s,2021-05-22 13:59:01

Just ignore last couple of weeks as it will be updated and have fun playing with the rest.

What should be noted is that 2019 was outlier year with much fewer deaths than usually (at least lowest in a decade). i. g. 2015-2018 differ max 0.7% from average, 2019 death toll was lower by almost 3%, 2020 - higher by \~7.2%. So if you count death toll for 2019-2020 its average is only higher by 2.1% compared to 2015-2018 average, or 3867 per 2 years. As for 2021 the cumulative death toll after first 4 month is 2.7% lower than 2015-2018 at this time. \*I've used 2015–2021 as this data is in a spreadsheet, but 2010-2014 data is very similar and Sweden demographics changes pretty fast to look in to the longer period.

So it looks like there were many unhealthy people left after 2019 and that this amplified covid impact/total death toll in 2020, but for 2021 it's at least back to normal and with vaccines lower death toll than average won't be a surprise.

"UK SAGE committee, published 21 May:

“Executive Summary
1. SARS-CoV-2 is evolving antigenically. Some variants are less well neutralized by antibodies raised to current vaccines, and the vaccine efficacy against these variants is lower than for matched virus.
2. Administration of further doses of the current vaccine, which is based on the spike protein from the Wuhan-like virus that emerged in 2019, might maintain and/or boost protection into winter 2021/22, but potentially less so for individuals with a less robust immune response, and less so if substantially antigenically variant viruses circulate widely. Eventually it is likely that the virus will display sufficient substantial antigenic variation and current vaccines will fail to protect against transmission, infection, or even against disease caused by newer variants.
3. Loss of vaccine effectiveness will result in further economic and social costs.
4. A solution is to update vaccines to keep pace with virus evolution, and the newer, more flexible vaccine platforms are particularly suitable for this approach.
5. Additional potential solutions are to invest in developing new vaccination strategies that could induce stronger T cell responses since T cell epitopes might vary less over time.

6. Another strategy would be to search for more broadly protective vaccines, including
 universal vaccine candidates, multivalent vaccines, and heterologous prime-boost strategies

7. We should also consider whether future vaccination policy will aim to immunize the whole population or only those at risk from severe disease, and how this might be impacted by the long-term accumulation of baseline immunity in the population and long-term evolution of the virus.

"**Abstract**

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) has raised questions regarding the extent of protection of currently implemented vaccines. Ten ""vaccination breakthrough"" infections were identified in Alachua County, Florida, among individuals fully vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine as a result of social or household transmission. Eight individuals presented mild symptoms in the absence of infection with other common respiratory viruses, confirmed using viral genetic sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were successfully generated for five of the vaccine breakthroughs and 399 individuals in the surrounding area and were included for reference-based phylogenetic investigation. These five individuals were characterized by infection with both VOCs and low-frequency variants present within the surrounding population. Mutations in the Spike protein were consistent with their respective circulating lineages, with the exception of a viable, low-frequency (approximately 1%) B.1.1.7 mutation, which we describe as a mutation of potential concern. The findings indicate that in cases of limited vaccine protection, infection is not restricted to VOCs or high-risk settings, highlighting the critical need for continued testing and monitoring of infection among individuals regardless of vaccination status.",nhz3az,2021-05-21 19:24:38
"The conclusion is as limited as the study.  They sequenced 5 breakthrough infections back when wildtype covid made up 99% of cases and found that some of them were wildtype. This confirms what the vaccine trials showed, albeit in a much smaller sample size.",nhz3az,2021-05-21 20:40:19
"Read through this and this is like a totally redundant study. How did it even get posted?

Vaccine trials, all of them, never showed 100% efficacy. Why is it even necessary to prove that a small percentage of those vaccinated would become infected, when we’ve known this since vaccines began trials? 

It’s like suddenly only 100% effective treatments/vaccines are accepted. Since when is anything in medicine 100% effective? 

I’d be pretty upset if I funded this study",nhz3az,2021-05-21 21:37:19
"That isn’t the point of this study.

This is the first paper (probably more to come later) describing their work investigating details of vaccine breakthrough cases and comparing them to other (unvaccinated) cases. The objective appears to be to look for things that are more common in breakthrough cases than unvaccinated cases, whether that’s a particular age group or risk factor, viral strain/spike protein mutation, etc.

If 10% of all cases had a particular strain but 80% of breakthrough cases had that strain, that would suggest that the vaccine might not be protecting as well against that strain.

With only 10 breakthrough cases their results might not be all that interesting **yet**, but as they continue to accumulate more data this is going to be a very interesting and useful project. And getting some little “hey, we’re doing this!” paper out to document their work thusfar might help them attract interest and funding to keep this going.",nhz3az,2021-05-21 22:10:16
"I think, to echo u/positivityrate here, this is more of a piece of evidence, albeit very small, that variants might not be the problem we thought, and so far, it's not the only one pointing in that direction, so that's pretty good actually.",nhz3az,2021-05-22 16:21:05
"Why’d you be upset, though? It has indeed proved the immediately obvious, but surely that’s what it set out to do, and any funding would have been on that basis?",nhz3az,2021-05-21 22:04:34
"Been thinking about this overnight, and I figured it out.

Your interpretation of this study is backwards. The conclusion is not obvious.

This is further indication that variants aren't more dangerous for vaccinated people.",nhz3az,2021-05-22 14:26:47
"Right. And, wouldn't the point of this information be to make a case booster shots?",nhz3az,2021-05-22 19:37:57
We don’t even have large numbers of vaccinated people with sterilising immunity (neither recovered people) in the world so that it would exert some kind of evolutionary pressure.,nhz3az,2021-05-22 18:23:49
"I suppose so, but I find it strange that funding would be granted to a study with an immediately  determined, almost pre-ordained conclusion",nhz3az,2021-05-21 22:19:50
"Or against booster shots of a different spike.

It would seem to me that it makes the argument that it doesn't seem to matter much if you get vaccinated with the original spike or the spike from one of the new variants.",nhz3az,2021-05-22 21:16:24
"I would say that depends on context. Percentage worldwide? No, that's true. In countries like the UK, Israel, even the US? These countries are well on track to widespread immunity, and so far it stands to reason even decent sterilizing immunity, at least in a part of the vaccinated populace.",nhz3az,2021-05-22 18:34:40
"It’s not that though, they’re not looking for whether or not breakthrough cases exist as you seem to be thinking, they’re checking for factors that make breakthrough cases more likely, basically looking for WHY the vaccine sometimes fails to prevent infection rather than IF it sometimes fails

Knowing why may help inform public health decisions, since it makes a big difference whether the failures are disproportionally in a certain age group, disproportionally from a particular strain, disproportionally in people with certain health problems, disproportionally affecting those with a higher initial viral dose, etc. Knowing these things may help us reduce breakthrough infections, may give us more direction when looking at boosters (for example, if it were to show that 90% of failures were from a particular strain in obese patients, that may entice you to make obesity a higher priority factor when distributing a booster for that strain), or if initial viral dose were a major factor in breakthrough cases, that could inform us that we’d still need to avoid certain high risk environments still even after being vaccinated, etc",nhz3az,2021-05-22 00:01:20

"**Abstract**

Transient lymphopenia is a common feature of acute viral respiratory infections. The drastic and prolonged lymphopenia of COVID-19, however, is distinctive and largely stems from falling counts of T cells. This T-cell lymphopenia may contribute to the inordinate rise in COVID-19 mortality with older age, because naive T-cell clonal expansion is telomere length (TL)-dependent and TL of hematopoietic cells shortens with age. Here we present a biologically plausible model that links naive T-cell clonal expansion capacity and age-dependent hematopoietic cell TL (HCTL) shortening to explain the T- cell shortfall and the high COVID-19 mortality in older adults. The model shows that an individual with average HCTL at age twenty years maintains maximal T-cell clonal expansion capacity until the 6th decade of life when this capacity plummets by more than 90% over the next eight years. The collapse coincides with the steep increase in COVID-19 mortality with age. As young adults tend to maintain their relative HCTL over their life course, individuals with above and below average HCTL respectively experience the drop in maximal T-cell clonal expansion capacity at older and younger ages. HCTL metrics may thus explain the vulnerability of older adults to COVID-19 and predict the capacity for T-cell clonal expansion following vaccination against the virus.",nhz1z8,2021-05-21 19:24:55

"Abstract

  
Context. Calcifediol has been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients. Objective: To compare the administration or not of oral calcifediol on mortality risk of patients hospitalized because of COVID-19. Design: Retrospective, multicenter, open, non-randomized cohort study. Settings: Hospitalized care. Patients: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 5 February and 5 May 2020 in five hospitals in the South of Spain. Intervention: Patients received calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) treatment (0.266 mg/capsule, 2 capsules on entry and then one capsule on day 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) or not. Main Outcome Measure: In-hospital mortality during the first 30 days after admission. Results: A total of 537 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 (317 males (59%), median age, 70 years), and 79 (14.7%) received calcifediol treatment. Overall, in-hospital mortality during the first 30 days was 17.5%. The OR of death for patients receiving calcifediol (mortality rate of 5%) was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.61) compared to patients not receiving such treatment (mortality rate of 20%; p < 0.01). Patients who received calcifediol after admission were more likely than those not receiving treatment to have comorbidity and a lower rate of CURB-65 score for pneumonia severity ³ 3 (one point for each of confusion, urea > 7 mmol/L, respiratory rate ³ 30/min, systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure £ 60 mm Hg, and age ³ 65 years), acute respiratory distress syndrome (moderate or severe), c-reactive protein, chronic kidney disease, and blood urea nitrogen. In a multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for confounders, there were significant differences in mortality for patients receiving calcifediol compared with patients not receiving it (OR = 0.16 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.80). Conclusion: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment with calcifediol, compared with those not receiving calcifediol, was significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality during the first 30 days. The observational design and sample size may limit the interpretation of these findings.",nhz1jo,2021-05-21 19:13:18
"I'm not very familiar with scientific papers... is it significant that the treated group have lower crp, nlr, ARDS moderate or severe. If the treatment group were less ill, wouldn't a lower proportion of them be likely to die anyway?",nhz1jo,2021-05-22 06:07:56

This is actually the first metabolite of vitamin D which avoids the problems with bolus dosing. The issue with bolus dosing is that it's too much vitamin D for your liver to process so it's excreted before it can become metabolized into its active form.

">**Abstract**

>Cases of unusual thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) have been reported. The term vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) was coined to reflect this new phenomenon. In vitro experiments with VIPIT patient sera indicated that high dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) competitively inhibit the platelet activating properties of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induced antibodies. Here, we report a case of a 62-year-old woman, who had received this vaccine and developed VIPIT. She visited the emergency ward because of petechiae and hematomas. In the laboratory work-up, thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer, and positivity in the platelet factor 4/heparin-enzyme-immunoassay were present. Signs and symptoms of thrombosis were absent. Upon immediate therapy with non-heparin anticoagulation, high dose IVIG, and prednisolone laboratory parameters steadily improved and the patient was discharged from hospital without thrombotic complications. We conclude that early initiation of VIPIT treatment results in a swift response without thrombotic complications.",nhnax7,2021-05-21 09:12:49

"This entire study seems to be centered around a theoretical, mathematical model, and I didn't see any attempt to actually validate that model.

If they're not equally effective, then why was there no standard set for masks early on?",nh7q3e,2021-05-21 01:59:45
">The effectiveness of masks, however, is still under debate. Compared to N95/FFP2 respirators which have very low particle penetration rates (around \~5%), surgical and similar masks exhibit higher and more variable penetration rates (around \~30-70%) (2, 3). Given the large number of particles emitted upon respiration and especially upon sneezing or coughing (4), the number of respiratory particles that may penetrate masks is substantial, which is one of the main reasons leading to doubts about their efficacy in preventing infections. Moreover, randomized clinical trials show inconsistent or inconclusive results, with some studies reporting only a marginal benefit or no effect of mask use (5, 6). Thus, surgical and similar masks are often considered to be ineffective. **On the other hand, observational data show that regions or facilities with a higher percentage of the population wearing masks have better control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (7–9). So how to explain these contrasting results and apparent inconsistencies?**

"When the data hits the ground, we may already have what is needed at a population level. Using this years CDC influenza data just may tell a tale about the efficacy of masking combined with social distancing, at least as it relates to influenza. But using that as a surrogate combined with other analyses. Further, not that Covid opened up the gates of alternative vaccine tech we may have a paradigm change in the effectiveness of yearly influenza vaccines so these data may be the last under the old ways of addressing airborne transmitted diseases. [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) 

""Between October 1, 2020, and April 30, 2021, FluSurv-NET sites in 14 states reported 226 laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations for an overall cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population. **This is lower than rates for any season since routine data collection began in 2005, including the low severity 2011-12 season. The current rate is one-tenth the rate during the 2011-12 season.** Due to low case counts, only overall cumulative rates for the entire network are being reported this season.""

Why is influenza being reported at rates 1/10th of the mildest (well documented) season in recent history? What was different? Well, Covid obviously, but also relatively speaking, very high rates of population use of masks and social distancing. Was that a factor? The data may reflect different levels of transmission efficiency for individual airborne infections, and there may be some as of yet unknown factor like one airborne infection sucking all the air out of the room for others, but I'm thinking population level use of masks combined with social distancing approaches is going to be found to be a major factor. We have yet to see anyone even speaking to this issue as evidenced by the almost unbelievably low rates of influenza...  Once we as a population stimulus generalize this new virus with resulting ongoing strategies of things like ""tuned"" booster vaccinations we will see some form of ongoing use of mask and social distancing tactical implementation on a seasonal basis, not ONLY for Covid but in recognition that it has an impact on all airborne disease we are presently aware of.",nh7q3e,2021-05-21 13:02:20

The issue with demonstrating efficacy in the real world is similar to the flu challenge study mentioned in another comment. Studies like DANMASK simply didn't see enough infections on either side to demonstrate efficacy. Population studies can only look at the effects of mandates and not individual behavior - mask-wearing may induce behaviors that indirectly reduce exposure (avoiding situations that ""feel dangerous"" because you have to wear a mask there) or conversely might increase exposure through risk compensation (taking more risky behavior due to belief that the mask is more protective than it is).",nh7q3e,2021-05-20 23:31:01

There is one unofficial comparison made on the net as ""a tale of two Dakotas"" which had very different masking laws, but almost the exact same infection rates.

Other countries saw no dent in the progression of the infection rates following masking requirements.

That could mean masks theoretically work, but too many people are using them wrong. Or they don't work under real world conditions. Who knows. But reality shows very little to no effect.

If the source of contamination was a boiler or something, these methods would likewise be completely normal and non-medical. The only difference is the filter is attached to a person... still a fine study on its own terms.

For what it's worth, the engineers definitely need to spend more time talking to people who know about microbes and disease, because most buildings, vehicles etc. do a poor job of protecting against airborne pathogens. And the medical people need to spend more time listening to the engineers because many of them seem to have badly understood the physics of how things move through the air.

"If you haven't noticed, Epidemiologists seldom come to ""real conclusions"" regarding much of anything. But they will sure give it a go in their eternal chase for statistical significance... Time will tell. We DO KNOW that the 2020/2021 Influenza season is one for the record and history books in terms of low rates of infection. The question is WHY? There are many possible reasons likely most of them working together ranging from surveillance sensitivity/specificity within the context of a Pandemic caused by a different organism to things we do NOT know and may not have even asked the questions before... At this point, I do not even see anyone pointing out this extremely notable set of data (low rates of influenza) or asking questions. I think this is a very important one. I feel pretty sure that mask wearing and social distancing are factors but to what degree I surely cannot say.  I am sure someone will eventually ask the questions and attempt to put the data together to try and understand. I don't do math. I point out things and let other people do the math... It's kind of like my yellow lab. All I gotta do is give him the ball and he does the rest.

At this point we have data squirting our of ears. Most of it is noise. Someone needs to take all this noise and start integrating it into a usable form by first identifying key data elements and orienting them as indicators pointing back toward useful interventions. For example, my programs created performance indicators for HIV disease. One of the ones we created were the use of CD4's at diagnosis of HIV. We created a CD4 profile in three parts one was ""normal"" then there was the middle area and finally the point where CD4's alone were indicative of an AIDS diagnosis. We proposed as an objective to assess our prevention programs and their various elements like PCRS and outreach and sub-pops like IDU's and we looked at the individuals coming into the systems at first diagnosis for HIV I postulated. The goal was to reduce the numbers of individuals coming into the systems with AIDS by CD4 diagnoses. IF we could have more individuals coming into the systems earlier in the course of disease as a whole (indicated by CD4's) that would reflect upon the effectiveness of our prevention programs as a whole. We could also look at individual elements of the prevention program such as partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) where disease intervention specialists would interview new cases for at risk partners and then go test those partners and find new cases and bring them into the treatment infrastructures. We could then put resources toward things that work and away from things that did not as part of a quality management approach to fighting a disease...at a population level. PCRS, for example, consistently at a state program level consistently found people earlier in the course of disease vs more passive elements of the Prevention Program array. This was incorporated into national performance indicators.

Most science tends to focus upon the bark on a tree in exquisite detail.  You don't impact source spread relationships at that level. If you want to stop spread, you have to look at the tree and its bark, within the context of the forest, let's say 10,000, to 20,000 feel and figure out what's going on in the forest or population to impact source spread relationships. I believe that influenza can be used as a surrogate for better understanding Covid because we know so much about influenza as opposed to Covid.  Understanding one, can inform on the other. We know flu. Covid19 by definition is novel...but it is also of a class that is presently extant within the population. What can we learn from that and the fact that the two primary Covid like diseases extant within the population are relatively benign cold like diseases. Will this one too evolve in that direction?  I lived at 20,000 feet before retirement and having started knocking on doors, I had a different perspective than most academically trained Epidemiologists. I knew what worked and knew how to prove it with data, but I hate the math. But that's what good academically trained Epi's are for... Although they sometimes need to be reminded about their prophet John Snow. Many would at present argue that he didn't have enough data to come to the conclusions he did and they would want more more more in ever greater detail before they will come to any conclusions about anything.",nh7q3e,2021-05-21 17:15:31

"True, but you can distill down to encompassing population level identifiable behavioral changes like mask wearing and social distancing. Then because you have different compliance levels in different areas including ""orders"" and those differences, you may be able to assess differences in transmission levels and derive relative value. The ""Sweden"" example as compared to others for comparative data is one approach. In addition, if a country has few if any controls and then puts them in place one can look for changes in rates, hospitalizations etc. Great Britain comes to mind. 

There is some of this going on. At some point meta analyses can be done or data can be looked at from different perspectives. We are still early and what and how they measure things are still being figured out. Many have discordant results or results that do not seem to make sense or contradict hypotheses. But there is data and if you collect it correctly in a standardized fashion it can often be looked at from a different perspective.",nh7q3e,2021-05-25 12:55:20
"FYI, those are daily growth rates in the number of cases/deaths, not the actual number of cases/deaths.  Those changes compound every day and can become significant quickly.  For instance if the growth rate in daily cases is 5% per day before a mandate and then decreases to 3.5% a couple weeks later, that compounds into a major reduction in the overall number of cases down the road compared to if the rate stayed the same.  It’s like how reducing the interest rate on your mortgage even a small amount can significantly reduce the total amount you end up paying over time. 

A quote from the author:

> The reductions in growth rates varied from half a percentage point to nearly 2 percentage points. That may sound small, but the large number of people involved means the impact grows with time, experts said.

>“Each day that growth rate is going down, the cumulative effect — in terms of cases and deaths — adds up to be quite substantial,” said Gery Guy Jr., a CDC scientist who was the study’s lead author.

In general, when talking about rates, **a drop of x percentage points** means you subtract that number of percentage points, not multiply by its complement like how you would when you **decrease a quantity by x percent** (notice the difference in phrasing between the bolded parts).  When talking about interest rates for example, if the rate falls from 4% to 2%, that would be a two percentage point decrease in the rate.  The paper uses the term ‘percentage point change’ which confirms this.",nh7q3e,2021-05-21 22:09:29

"I could see ultimately some form of predictive formula for assessing the potentials of novel airborne infectious diseases and others with key indicators like applying a transmissibility factor(s) relating to efficiency addressing both airborne and surface/blood exposure etc., a population density factor, an intervention factor where compliance tied to known ""relative effectiveness"" or what we are specifically talking about in this thread at least as a ""predictive"" formula for future novel viruses. Orient around key factors in the spread of infections with pandemic potential. It would help focus initial research to quickly identify key indicators and perhaps reduce the ""noise"" associated with research. Once the danger is somewhat quantified then go off on tangents to qualitatively flesh out the danger in respect to its nuances.  This actually done...to a degree...already. We know TB, for example and we know it is relatively inefficient from a transmission standpoint. We know flu in its variants and can say for example and very generally, that B's are less of a threat than A's. We know Ebola. We have enough data on these to begin to create a ""threat"" template that can be implemented in the future.  Sub-research elements that relate to transmissibility (known factors) as in genomic characteristics can then be focused on from the gitgo. This all would be a dynamic and cannot be too rigid and as we learn more we can refine both the standardized approach and around individual organisms.

This is not new and was first nascently proposed as far back as the early/mid 2000's with the CDC Pandemic Severity Index. I was peripherally involved in that at an operational level not development [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/severity-assessment-framework.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/severity-assessment-framework.html)  Check out this WHO page on this very issue. [https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance\_monitoring/pisa/en/](https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/pisa/en/)  ""In 2011, the IHR Review Committee on Pandemic Influenza (H1N1) 2009 recommended WHO develop and apply measures that can be used to assess the severity of every influenza epidemic: ""By applying, evaluating and refining tools to measure severity every year, WHO and Member States can be better prepared to assess severity in the next pandemic.""

These things were NOT even looked at during Covid... AND, our technology has improved greatly since first proposed to address some of the nuance. The focus has been focused on Flu, but as the last year has illustrated that is but one danger... These first attempts were a good try, but we can do better AND maybe help focus the entire world's approach to future pandemics... I still find it interesting that the world went off completely half cocked and never even brought this kind of key ""approach"" up...ever... I'm gonna give the world a D minus for its overall performance over the last year... A certain level of ""panic"" has characterized the world approach along with politicization. Some high points like the ""new"" vaccine technology take it up from an F...minus but even those could have been already being used with influenza for at least 10 years but were not because there was no overriding incentive to do so until the Covid poo hit the fan...",nh7q3e,2021-05-25 16:25:34

">LONDON and SAN FRANCISCO, May 21, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GlaxoSmithKline plc and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) has issued a positive scientific opinion following the referral of sotrovimab to the CHMP under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004. The opinion relates to the use of sotrovimab for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over and weighing at least 40 kg) with COVID-19 who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.

>The CHMP opinion under Article 5(3) can now be considered by the national authorities in EU member states when taking evidence-based decisions on the early use of the medicine prior to marketing authorization.

[some quotes]

>The CHMP reached its opinion following a review of data including an interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial, which evaluated sotrovimab as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization. Efficacy results of the interim analysis, based on data from 583 randomized patients, demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalization or death in those receiving sotrovimab compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. As a result, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped for enrollment due to evidence of profound efficacy. The CHMP also considered data on the medicine’s quality and safety.

>The CHMP also reviewed data from several in vitro studies which demonstrated that sotrovimab maintains activity against multiple circulating variants of concern, including the variants from Brazil (P.1), California (B.1.427/B.1.429), South Africa (B.1.351) and the UK (B.1.1.7), based on in vitro data from live virus and pseudotyped virus assays. Additional in vitro data demonstrating activity against variants from New York (B.1.526) and India (B.1.617) were also recently published by bioRxiv. The clinical impact of these variants is not yet known. Sotrovimab targets a conserved epitope of the spike protein which is less likely to mutate over time. Data collection and analysis is still ongoing.

>The CHMP’s review took place in parallel to the EMA’s ongoing rolling review process, which is used to speed up the formal marketing application assessment of a promising medicine during a public health emergency. The rolling review will continue until enough evidence is available to support a formal Marketing Authorization Application.

>An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application for sotrovimab has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and it is also under review by other global regulators including Health Canada under the expedited Interim Order application pathway for COVID-19 drugs.

>Sotrovimab is an investigational compound and has not been granted a marketing authorization anywhere in the world.

>**About the COMET-ICE Study Design**

>The multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial investigated intravenous (IV) infusion of sotrovimab in adults with mild or moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease.

>This ongoing trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single IV infusion of sotrovimab (500 mg) or placebo in non-hospitalized participants globally. The safety of sotrovimab is primarily based on an interim analysis from 868 patients (430 patients in the treatment arm and 438 in the placebo arm) through Day 29. Among those studied, 63% were Hispanic or Latino and 7% were Black or African American. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these populations are approximately three times more likely to be hospitalized and approximately two times more likely to die2 of COVID-19. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who have progression of COVID-19 as defined by the need for hospitalization for at least 24 hours or death within 29 days of randomization.

>The only event to occur with a frequency of greater than 1% in the sotrovimab arm was diarrhea (less than 1% in placebo group). All other adverse events with a frequency of greater than 1% occurred in the placebo arm. No other treatment-emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo. Sotrovimab’s safety and efficacy is continuing to be studied in ongoing clinical trials with analysis of safety and efficacy data at Day 29 for the full population from COMET-ICE expected as early as the first half of 2021.",nhtbwf,2021-05-21 15:06:52

T-Cells kill the cells that have taken up the vaccine mRNA and are presenting spike protein on their surfaces. This happens almost immediately, within a day of vaccination after transfected cells express the viral proteins.

So as these cells are producing virus proteins, any that are in the cytoplasm and haven't been attached to cell surface are released.

B-Cells start to release the antibodies but the response isn't detectable until day 5.

After day 5 the circulating virus antigen levels in the body start falling until they are 'gone' two weeks post vaccination.

"Because we have surveillance of potentially emergent viruses, but that surveillance can't cover every virus in the world. A virus, like this one, caught in that surveillance at the source, of course we know where it comes from.

We do pretty well know the ultimate origin of SARS-CoV-2 because of its sequence similarity to bat viruses that had been sequenced before, and SARS-CoV. The only ""mystery"" is all the steps that had to happen between bats and infecting thousands of people in Wuhan undetected, because this particular virus hadn't been detected and tracked before that happened.

Research into emergent coronaviruses is still relatively young compared to what has been known about emergent flu viruses over the past century - really only picking up steam since SARS. Remember the endemic viruses HKU1 and NL63 were discovered in 2004. Viruses nearly every living human has been exposed to frequently since early childhood. This is still fast moving science.",nhty2v,2021-05-21 17:17:41

"Summary
Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA requires sequential reactions facilitated by the replication and transcription complex (RTC). Here, we present a structural snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transitions toward cap structure synthesis. We determine the atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by nsp7-nsp82-nsp12-nsp132-RNA and a single RNA-binding protein, nsp9. Nsp9 binds tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N terminus inserting into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5′ extension of template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results reason an intermediate state of RTC toward mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development.",nhxd3f,2021-05-22 16:40:54

"Abstract:

An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will involve a range of complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and virucidal (irreversible) activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for i) reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect of 0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells, and ii) infectious virus release by plaque assay of 0.019 to 0.032 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells and 0.031 to 0.037 mg/mL in Calu-3 cells. The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also virucidal, irreversibly reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by >99.9% (>3 log10) within 1 minute of exposure, and up to >99.999% (>5 log10) shown at astodrimer sodium concentrations of 10 to 30 mg/mL in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines. Astodrimer sodium also inhibited infection in a primary human airway epithelial cell line. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium being due to irreversible inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial attachment of the virus to the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a topically administered agent for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic applications.",nhmgb3,2021-05-21 08:12:15

"Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to damage multiple organs, including the brain. Multiorgan MRI can provide further insight on the repercussions of COVID-19 on organ health but requires a balance between richness and quality of data acquisition and total scan duration. We adapted the UK Biobank brain MRI protocol to produce high-quality images while being suitable as part of a post-COVID-19 multiorgan MRI exam. The analysis pipeline, also adapted from UK Biobank, includes new imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) designed to assess the effects of COVID-19. A first application of the protocol and pipeline was performed in 51 COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 25 controls participating in the Oxford C-MORE study. The protocol acquires high resolution T1, T2-FLAIR, diffusion weighted images, susceptibility weighted images, and arterial spin labelling data in 17 minutes. The automated imaging pipeline derives 1575 IDPs, assessing brain anatomy (including olfactory bulb volume and intensity) and tissue perfusion, hyperintensities, diffusivity, and susceptibility. In the C-MORE data, these quantitative measures were consistent with clinical radiology reports. Our exploratory analysis tentatively revealed that recovered COVID-19 patients had a decrease in frontal grey matter volumes, an increased burden of white matter hyperintensities, and reduced mean diffusivity in the total and normal appearing white matter in the posterior thalamic radiation and sagittal stratum, relative to controls. These differences were generally more prominent in patients who received organ support. Increased T2* in the thalamus was also observed in recovered COVID-19 patients, with a more prominent increase for non-critical patients. This initial evidence of brain changes in COVID-19 survivors prompts the need for further investigations. Follow-up imaging in the C-MORE study is currently ongoing, and this protocol is now being used in large-scale studies. The pipeline is widely applicable and will contribute to new analyses to hopefully clarify the medium to long-term effects of COVID-19.",ngsmk7,2021-05-20 07:17:23

"> Emerging evidence points towards an intricate relationship between the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes. While pre-existing diabetes is associated with severe COVID-19, it is unclear if COVID-19 severity is a cause or consequence of diabetes. To mechanistically link COVID-19 to diabetes, we tested whether insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and cause β-cell depletion. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2 and related entry factors (TMPRSS2, NRP1, TRFC) are expressed in β-cells, with selectively high expression of NRP1. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infects human pancreatic β-cells in patients who succumbed to COVID-19 and selectively infects human islet β-cells in vitro. We demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection attenuates pancreatic insulin levels and secretion, and induces β-cell apoptosis, each rescued by NRP1 inhibition. Phosphoproteomic pathway analysis of infected islets indicates apoptotic β-cell signaling, similar to that observed in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). In summary, our study shows SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce β-cell killing.

This isn't surprising considering that severe COVID19 [is believed to induce ketosis and ketoacidosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7264681/).

BACKGROUND

Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential, as is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa.

METHODS

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose.

RESULTS

Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (95.1% of 41 with sequencing data) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups.

CONCLUSIONS

A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.",ngyug0,2021-05-20 13:27:41

How so? It shows that the efficacy is low or non-existent, definitely lower than with the previous variants. The estimate is very imprecise, but it's not meaningless.

"No, it showed that we can’t establish that it is effective and we can’t establish that it is ineffective, because the sample sizes were insufficient. By this logic you could design small studies and “prove” that all vaccines are ineffective.",ngyug0,2021-05-20 15:06:20
"Where did I or the article say anything about a proof that it's ineffective? The study gives an estimate of efficacy. From the point estimate and 95% confidence interval it's clear that 1) the efficacy is relatively low (for example, it's very unlikely that it's > 60%) and 2) the results are consistent with lack of efficacy (which is very different from saying they constitute a proof of lack of efficacy).  

> we can’t establish that it is ineffective  

Of course. You'd have to define a threshold for lack of efficacy to ever be able to show that because it's never possible to show that efficacy is exactly equal to zero.

">It doesn’t prove it in any accepted conventional biostatistical sense because it is wildly far away from any statistical significance.

You can't have a statistically significant result that shows no effect. You can only have statistically significant differences. Statistical significance is what we use to determine if there's evidence of a change or difference.

Non-significant results (which is what we have here) don't (on their own) indicate that the sample size was too small. They are taken to indicate no change, difference or effect.

What you've been speaking to is the *power* of the test. Generally clinical studies want a power around .8, which is what they had for this test. So it's not underpowered.

Since the result is not significant, we're at risk of a type II error. The power of the test is directly related to this risk (probability of a type II error is 1 - power). So there's a .2 chance of a type II error here. My understanding is that's generally acceptable in clinical research.",ngyug0,2021-05-20 20:46:08
"> it is wildly far away from any statistical significance  

You need to have a null hypothesis for statistical significance to have any meaning. So what is your null hypothesis that would represent lack of efficacy?  

It's worth noting that statistical significance has been [facing strong criticism](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00874-8) over the last 10 years or so and while it's useful in a formal decision-making context like drug approval, there's a trend to move away from it in broader scientific reasoning. It's more useful to look at a degree/range of uncertainty in an estimate rather than to reduce a result to ""significant"" or ""not significant"" (which, by the way, doesn't even confirm what the true value is, only that it's different from the null value). Some scientific journals have gone as far as banning any reference to statistical significance.  

> people are looking at the point estimate of 10% and saying it’s ineffective. But this 10% (which I’m agree would represent ineffectiveness) is not reliably estimated here.  

I've said before that the estimate is imprecise. But taking any point estimate too seriously is wrong. In this case, with the point estimate and 95% CI taken together, it's likely that the true efficacy is relatively low. It could be 10%, 20%, maybe even 50%, though the further you go from that 10%, the less likely it is.  

In fact, if you want to stick with statistical significance, the 95% CI tells you that you could reject a null hypothesis of ""efficacy >= 55%"" (at a 95% confidence level).",ngyug0,2021-05-20 16:29:30
"> Non-significant results (which is what we have here) don't (on their own) indicate that the sample size was too small. They are taken to indicate no change, difference or effect.  

They tend to be taken as that, but that's a wrong interpretation. Lack of statistical significance is still consistent with a range of non-zero differences between interventions (or intervention and placebo). In this particular case, I'd say it's very implausible that the there is no vaccine effect at all. The point estimate (10%) remains its most likely value (most consistent with the data), even if 0 is likely enough not to reject it.  

[Equivalence between interventions in clinical trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18537788/) is established differently. You first define the smallest difference that would be clinically meaningful and then test a null hypothesis that the true difference is greater than that. In practice, this is done by checking that the 95% CI doesn't contain values above that minimum difference threshold. If we wanted to use this method in the case of AZ trial with 50% efficacy as the minimum (which was a regulatory threshold for covid vaccines from the FDA), we wouldn't be able to conclude that there is no meaningul difference between the vaccine and placebo (because the 95% CI goes above 50%).  

But, as I've said before, I don't think the hypothesis testing / statistical significance approach is very useful in interpreting research results.",ngyug0,2021-05-21 00:39:39

">**Abstract**

>**Background**: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with significant maternal morbidity and increased rates of preterm birth. For this reason, COVID-19 vaccine administration in pregnancy has been endorsed by multiple professional societies including ACOG and SMFM despite exclusion of pregnant women from initial clinical trials of vaccine safety and efficacy. However, to date little data exists regarding outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant patients.

>**Study Design**: A comprehensive vaccine registry was combined with a delivery database for an integrated healthcare system to create a delivery cohort including vaccinated patients. Maternal sociodemographic data were examined univariately for factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Pregnancy and birth outcomes were analyzed, including a composite measure of maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications, the Adverse Outcome Index.

>**Results**: Of 2002 patients in the delivery cohort, 140 (7.0%) received a COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and 212 (10.6%) experienced a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. The median gestational age at first vaccination was 32 weeks (range 13 6/7-40 4/7), and patients vaccinated during pregnancy were less likely than unvaccinated patients to experience COVID-19 infection prior to delivery (1.4% (2/140) vs. 11.3% (210/1862)) P<0.001No maternal COVID-19 infections occurred after vaccination during pregnancy. Factors significantly associated with increased likelihood of vaccination included older age, higher level of maternal education, lower pre-pregnancy BMI, and use of infertility treatment for the current pregnancy. Tobacco or other substance use, Hispanic ethnicity, and higher gravidity were associated with a lower likelihood of vaccination. No significant difference in the composite adverse outcome (5.0% (7/140) vs. 4.9% (91/1862) P=0.95) or other maternal or neonatal complications, including thromboembolic events and preterm birth, was observed in vaccinated mothers compared to unvaccinated patients.

>**Conclusions**: Vaccinated pregnant women in this birth cohort were less likely to experience COVID-19 infection compared to unvaccinated pregnant patients, and COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased pregnancy or delivery complications. Significant sociodemographic disparities in vaccine uptake and/or access were observed among pregnant patients, and future efforts should focus on outreach to low-uptake populations.",ng0ttq,2021-05-19 10:11:26

">**Abstract**

>The durability of circulating neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their boosting by vaccination remains to be defined. We show that outpatient and hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals mount a robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) response that peaks at days 23 and 27 post-symptom onset, respectively. Although nAb titers remained higher in hospitalized patients, both study groups showed long-lasting nAb responses that can persist for up to 12 months after natural infection. These nAb responses in previously seropositive individuals can be significantly boosted through immunization with two doses of the CoronaVac (Sinovac) or one dose of the BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccines, suggesting a substantial induction of B cell memory responses. Noteworthy, three obese previously seropositive individuals failed to mount a booster response upon vaccination, warranting further studies in this population. Immunization of naive individuals with two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine or one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine elicited similar levels of nAbs compared to seropositive individuals 4,2 to 13.3 months post-infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this preliminary evidence suggests that both, seropositive and naive individuals, require two doses of CoronaVac to ensure the induction of robust nAb titers.",ng0mkk,2021-05-19 09:58:52

"**Abstract**


COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1–6. While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody (AAb) discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP)7 to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the “exoproteome”). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.",ng4orb,2021-05-19 13:39:10
"Wouldn't this essentially mean that COVID is an autoimmune disease?  Going off of [this definition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2703183/):

>In systemic autoimmune diseases, autoantibodies react with free molecules, such as phospholipids, as well as cell surface and nucleoprotein antigens, forming pathogenic antigen–antibody (immune) complexes. These autoantibodies injure tissues and organs through engagement of FcγR activation of complement as well as internalization and activation of Toll-like receptors. Activation of intracellular Toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells leads to the production of type I interferon, whereas engagement of intracellular Toll-like receptors on antigen-presenting cells stimulates cell activation and the production of other inflammatory cytokines. Thus, immune complexes might perpetuate a positive feedback loop amplifying inflammatory responses.

My  understanding is that the superior immune response of previously infected people has to do with the greater time between between most people's illnesses and their vaccination.

It's also seems to be a factor that the two vaccines are using different parts of the spike protein.

The Sputnik V vaccine uses a similar idea of two kinds of harmless virus to create what seems to be a very effective vaccine.

As Pfizer and AZ are using different parts of the protein the theory goes (from my understanding) that it may create a more well rounded and varied protection, meaning stronger overall immunity and possibly stronger against some future variants. Another pro may be managing to get people vaccinated more quickly as it won't matter what your previous jab was and if it's available.

"Indeed, but it seems quantifying that is difficult and it's more of a judgement call. And often that judgement call seems to work well, so there's nothing wrong with that.

(For example, the decision by JCVI in the UK to increase the interval between two Pfizer vaccines to twelve weeks. At the time Pfizer spoke up against that decision, but there was a study in the last week showing that seemed to offer more protection - albeit at the trade-off of spending longer ""half"" vaccinated. That was based on a judgement based on non-Covid vaccines rather than any specific evidence.)

So in this case I'm not sure how that call would be made unless it was obvious. But I'm not sure how obvious it is? Although it could be confirmed after the fact based on observation?

The reason why I'm interested in all this is how this would affect the models that predict the near future, if such a thing were widely adopted. For example there's an interesting summary in Table 1 in this model from Warwick University: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984533/S1229_Warwick_Road_Map_Scenarios_and_Sensitivity_Steps_3_and_4.pdf showing how they arrived at their modelling assumptions, including references to the raw data. There seems to be still more unknowns than knowns as well as some direct contradictions so being able to say any alternative is a net win is difficult.

But yes, I think this is getting more off-topic as I suppose for this particular study it doesn't matter, as the purpose was to verify a decision already taken for other reasons (the blood clotting issue), rather than to answer my concerns. And, for this choice (deliberately mixing vaccines) to be a real-world dilemma it requires a luxury of significant supplies of several different types of vaccine (and no restrictions due to the risk of blood clotting issues) which isn't the world we're currently in.",nfenua,2021-05-18 22:59:19

Oh good.  Someone remembered that memory cells exist and that circulating immunoglobulin is not the only way to have immunity.,nfaenm,2021-05-18 14:16:59
"**Abstract**

While some COVID-19 patients maintain SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgGs for more than 6 months post-infection, others, especially mild cases, eventually lose IgG levels. We aimed to assess the persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells in patients who have lost specific IgGs and analyzed the reactivity of the immunoglobulins produced by these B cells. Circulating IgG memory B cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in all 16 patients 1-8 months post-infection, and 11 participants had specific IgA B cells. Four patients lost specific serum IgG after 5-8 months but had SARS-CoV-2-specific-B-cell levels comparable to those of seropositive donors. Immunoglobulins produced after in vitro differentiation blocked receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding to the cellular receptor ACE-2, indicating neutralizing activity. Memory-B-cell-derived IgGs recognized the RBD of B.1.1.7 similarly to the wild-type, while reactivity to B.1.351 and P.1. decreased by 30% and 50%, respectively. Memory-B-cell differentiation into antibody-producing cells is a more sensitive method for detecting previous infection than measuring serum antibodies. Circulating SARS-CoV-2 IgG memory B cells persist, even in the absence of specific serum IgG; produce neutralizing antibodies; and show differential cross-reactivity to emerging variants of concern. These features of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells will help to understand and promote long-term protection.",nfaenm,2021-05-18 14:13:59

"Okay, before reading this:  I predict the paper actually means to say ""Antibodies persist for at least 13 months"".   Will update after reading.

UPDATE:  Yup.  

If I'm reading this correctly, results varied from test to test but one test in particular (CMIA) found IgG antibodies to the S protein in ~97% of the study's COVID-19 positive cohort both immediately after recovery and about a year later.    Levels decayed with time but not at an alarming rate.    Subsequent vaccination after infection sent anti-S IgG levels to consistently high levels.   

(Is the ""log"" in ""log AU/mL"" a base-10 log, so a move from ~2.5 to ~4.5 is a ~100x boost?  if so, wow!)",nep6bb,2021-05-18 01:18:18
"***Abstract:*** 

Assessment of the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is essential in predicting protection against reinfection and durability of vaccine protection. Here, we longitudinally measured Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies in **1,309 healthcare workers** (HCWs), including 916 COVID-19 negative HCWs and 393 convalescent COVID-19 for up to 422 days post-symptom. 

From month (M)1 to M7-9 post-infection, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies decreased moderately in convalescent HCWs in a biphasic model, with men showing a slower decay of anti-N (p=0.02), and a faster decay of anti-S (p=0.0008) than women. At M11-13, anti-N dramatically decreased (half-life: 283 days) while anti-S stabilized (half-life: 725 days) at a median of 2.39 log Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL (Interquartile Range (IQR): 2.10 -2.75). 

Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed in the COVID-19 negative group (incidence of 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one in the COVID-19 positive group (incidence of 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating **a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7% (p<0.0001)**. 

Correlation with live-virus neutralization assay revealed that variants D614G and B.1.1.7, but not B.1.351, were sensitive to anti-S antibodies at 2.3 log AU/mL, while IgG ≥ 3 log AU/mL neutralized all three variants. After SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, anti-S levels reached at least 3 logs regardless of pre-vaccination IgG levels, type of vaccine, and number of doses. 

Our study demonstrates a long-term persistence of anti-S IgG antibodies that may protect against reinfection. By significantly increasing cross-neutralizing antibody titers, a single-dose vaccination strengthens protection against escape mutants.",nep6bb,2021-05-17 20:21:15

"I consider the most important finding the 96.7% reduction in reinfection. We expected that some people wouldn't have antibodies after a lot of months, generally the immune system doesn't keep them for long term; that's why the immune system also has the T and B cells that could keep the patient protected. Their responses couldn't be measured directly but they're important for the reinfection rate.

This is discussed on page 9 and 10 of the [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823v3.full.pdf):

>During the period April 2020 – April 2021, 69 new infections were reported in COVID-19-negative participants while only one case of asymptomatic reinfection was reported in the COVID-19-positive participants. Although antibodies represent only a part of the immune response, this strongly suggests that COVID-19 positive patients develop a robust humoral immune response that reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection within at least one year.  
>  
>Interestingly, all individuals who received a SARS-COV-2 vaccine displayed high antibody titers able to neutralize all three variants tested, regardless of pre-vaccine anti-S IgG levels, type of vaccine (mRNA or adenovirus-vector vaccines) or number of vaccine doses. The increase in antibody titer was observed as early as 6 days after vaccination. This suggests that a robust memory B cell response is established in COVID-19 convalescents, including those with low antibody titers.  
>  
>This is in line with the study of Dan et al. who performed an extensive characterization of memory B cells, revealing that the slight antibody decline occurring in convalescent individuals does not reflect a real waning of humoral immunity, but rather a contraction of the immune response, whilst antibody affinity maturation occurs, and anti-S memory B cells persist(7).  
>  
>Very recently, Wang et al reported that memory B cell clones expressing broad and potent anti-S antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire at least one year after infection and expand after vaccination(19). These observations are very hopeful regarding the durability of humoral responses developed after COVID-19 and suggest that this protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection may last for years(19, 20).",nep6bb,2021-05-17 21:22:08
"> 70% for anti-N are seronegative at 11 months

I recall a source that talked about that:

> The drop in antibody titers was not evenly distributed over the different types (antibodies against the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the nucleoprotein (N), and IgM for these versus IgA)), but overall neutralizing antibody activity was down about five-fold at the six month point as compared to the after-one-month check

But

> What’s that antibody evolution look like, then? The good news is that the ones from the six-month check showed both increased potency and an increased range of responses against various protein mutations. That includes many of the ones that are in the news these days, things like R346S, Q493R, and E484K. (As an aside, did anyone ever imagine that amino acid variant notation would creep into major news stories? Strange days). But while the one-month antibody samples were unable to recognize these and bind to them, the six-month ones were.

I think we need to take into account that the relationships here are complicated, it not always down vs down sometimes not all responses are born the same.

Example: say you get a bag of  800 red and 200 blue marbles. You don't know the number of blue marbles inside, but you hypothesize it is eight to two. If you draw 10 marbles and get 8 red and 2 blue, you conclude there must be 800 red, 200 blue and the hypothesis was right. But you might instead get 10 blue and no red marbles. This would be totally non-reflective of the population. What is the probability of such a wrong result?

This is still true, the vaccine efficacy percentage is more robust because it was determined through a RCT on large trials several times over. While immunity derived from infection is still a bigger unknown than the vaccine one. It's a risk analysis decision, countries that can afford it recommend both doses to seropositive people, others recommend only one dose, or postponing the vaccine for X months.

Finally, there is the variability from person to person that is dependent on both unknown and known factors, including age.

But some reasonable percentage of sterilizing immunity is needed to prevent reinfections/breakthrough infections from eventually spreading the virus to everyone once (along with an inevitable series of mutations along the way).

Protective immunity is extremely hard to measure in the real world.  You need a very large sample size to get a reasonable credible interval on hospitalization or death rates.

"**Abstract**

As the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 persists across the world, it is of importance to understand the distributional behavior of incubation period of the variants for both medical research and public health policy-making. We collected the published individual level data of 941 patients of the 2020-2021 winter pandemic wave in Hebei province, north China. We computed some epidemiological characteristics of the wave and estimated the distribution of the incubation period. We further assessed the covariate effects of sex, age and living with a case with respect to incubation period by a model. The infection-fatality rate was only 0.1%. The estimated median incubation period was at least 22 days, significantly extended from the estimates (ranging from 4 to 8.5 days) of the previous wave in mainland China and those ever reported elsewhere around the world. The proportion of asymptomatic patients was 90.6%. No significant covariate effect was found. The distribution of incubation period of the new variants showed a clear extension from their early generations.",nfc424,2021-05-18 15:28:40

"**Abstract**

Mutations of the coronavirus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could impede drug development and reduce the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we developed a multiplexed Spike-ACE2 Inhibitor Screening (mSAIS) assay that can measure the neutralizing effect of antibodies across numerous variants of the coronavirus's Spike (S) protein simultaneously. By screening purified antibodies and serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinees against 72 S variants with the mSAIS assay, we identified new S mutations that are sensitive and resistant to neutralization. Serum from both infected and vaccinated groups with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) displayed a broader capacity to neutralize S variants than serum with low titer NAbs. These data were validated using serum from a large vaccinated cohort (n=104) with a tiled S peptide microarray. In addition, similar results were obtained using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay specific for wild-type S and four prevalent S variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1), thus demonstrating that high antibody diversity is associated with high NAb titers. Our results demonstrate the utility of the mSAIS platform in screening NAbs. Moreover, we show that heterogeneous antibody populations provide a more protective effect against S variants, which may help direct COVID-19 vaccine and drug development.",nfafwz,2021-05-18 14:15:21

>**Background**: Mass vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is on-going in the United States with vaccines approved for emergency use by the FDA. Each vaccine can induce spike-specific antibodies (Abs) with virus-neutralizing activities; however, the Fc-mediated Ab activities have received little attention. Moreover, while plasma/serum Abs are commonly studied, scant information is available about Abs in the respiratory mucosa, the site of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 

>**Methods**: Plasma and saliva were collected from mRNA vaccine recipients and convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Antigen-specific total Ig and Ig isotypes were measured. In addition to virus neutralization, Fc-mediated activities were investigated, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement deposition.

>**Results**: Similar to infection, vaccination stimulated spike-specific Ab responses detected in plasma and saliva, with IgG1 as the dominant isotype. Interestingly, vaccination produced greater IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 responses and higher ratios of (IgG1+IgG3)/(IgG2+IgG4) than infection. Moreover, while plasma neutralization and ADCP potencies were comparable in vaccinated and convalescent individuals, vaccine-induced plasma Abs elicited stronger complement binding and activation. 

>**Conclusion**: Compared with natural infection, mRNA vaccines induced a greater array of IgG subtypes against spike in saliva and plasma. The vaccine-induced Abs were also more potent in mediating complement activation.",net65c,2021-05-17 23:00:05

"Abstract

Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4–28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7–13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.",nefpli,2021-05-17 19:27:34
"Is there potential for developing a test for people who are at risk despite being fully vaccinated, such as over 80-year olds?  I wonder if it is possible to try and verify if a vaccine booster is needed, similar to how sometimes antibodies are checked to see if one needs a MMR booster.",nefpli,2021-05-18 07:57:06
"Neutralizing antibodies are the subset of spike-directed antibodies that gum up the works and prevent the virus from being functional.  You could imagine that some ways of getting those antibodies generated might change the fraction of total antibodies that are neutralizing, but they're always a subset.",nefpli,2021-05-18 01:52:47
Do binding antibodies have any function or do they just stick to it and that’s it? Would it be better to not have binding antibodies and just have neutralizing if that were possible to do?,nefpli,2021-05-19 13:22:26
"All antibodies will function as tags that activate immune cells that touch something tagged with them.  This is usually useful but can in SOME cases actually be a bad thing, by say allowing viruses to bind to immune cells if they are capable of replicating in them but ordinarily unable to stick to them.  That's a special case though, and when you have that possibility you want there to be neutralizers in addition to the binders.

Also since antibodies have two binding sites (or four, or ten for some of the antibody types that come as multimers), they can crosslink things together into aggregates that are less functional than whatever it is floating around on its own.",nefpli,2021-05-19 18:22:05
"So just to make sure I’m understanding, in general, for example, if some binding antibodies find a sars-cov-2 virus particle floating around and bind to it, then when those binding antibodies go floating past a t-cell, it can help the t-cell “know what to do”? And would this work for B cells as well? Perhaps telling the B cell to make neutralizing antibodies based on what the binding antibody is tagging?",nefpli,2021-05-19 18:29:12
Not so much the T cells and B cells but the innate immune cells that are always patrolling and don't have receptors tuned to particular learned targets.,nefpli,2021-05-19 22:55:09

>**Abstract**

>The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally continues to impact humanity on a global scale with rising morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of multiple effective vaccines, new vaccines continue to be required to supply ongoing demand. We report Day 42 interim safety and immunogenicity data from a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Adults aged 18+ immunized with a virus-like particle vaccine candidate produced in plants displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (CoVLP) adjuvanted with AS03 (NCT04636697). This report focuses on presenting safety, tolerability and immunogenicity, as measured by neutralizing antibody (NAb) and cell mediated immunity (IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot) responses, in Adults aged 18-64 (Adults) and Older Adults aged 65+ (Older Adults). CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 was well-tolerated and adverse events (AE) were primarily mild or moderate and of transient duration. AEs in Older Adults were more limited than those observed in the Adult population. CoVLP with AS03 induced a significant humoral immune response in both age cohorts. CoVLP with AS03 induced a greater humoral response in Adults than Older Adults after a single dose but this effect was overcome with a second dose when both age cohorts responded with NAb titers that were ~10-fold higher than those in a panel of sera from patients recovering from COVID-19. A single dose of CoVLP with AS03 induced a significant IFN-γ response in both age cohorts; a second dose significantly boosted IFN-γ and IL-4 responses in both age cohorts. Adults generated a stronger IFN-γ and IL-4 cellular response than did Older Adults after one or two doses of AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP. Safety and immunogenicity from Adults with comorbidities as well as final safety and immunogenicity responses after 12 months will be reported upon availability.",net4ip,2021-05-17 22:57:22

">PARIS and LONDON – May 17, 2021 – The Sanofi and GSK adjuvanted recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate achieved strong rates of neutralizing antibody responses, in line with those measured in people who have recovered from COVID-19, in all adult age groups in a Phase 2 study with 722 volunteers. A global pivotal Phase 3 study is expected to start in the coming weeks.

>The Phase 2 interim results showed 95% to 100% seroconversion following a second injection in all age groups (18 to 95 years old) and across all doses, with acceptable tolerability and with no safety concerns. Overall, the vaccine candidate elicited strong neutralizing antibody levels that were comparable to those generated by natural infection, with higher levels observed in younger adults (18 to 59 years old). After a single injection, high neutralizing antibody levels were generated in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting strong potential for development as a booster vaccine.

>*“Our Phase 2 data confirm the potential of this vaccine to play a role in addressing this ongoing global public health crisis, as we know multiple vaccines will be needed, especially as variants continue to emerge and the need for effective and booster vaccines, which can be stored at normal temperatures, increases”*, said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. *“With these favorable results, we are set to progress to a global Phase 3 efficacy study. We look forward to generating additional data and working with our partners around the world to make our vaccine available as quickly as possible.”*

>Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added: *“These positive data show the potential of this protein-based adjuvanted vaccine candidate in the broader context of the pandemic, including the need to address variants and to provide for booster doses. We believe that this vaccine candidate can make a significant contribution to the ongoing fight against COVID-19 and will move to Phase 3 as soon as possible to meet our goal of making it available before the end of the year.”*

>Based on these positive Phase 2 interim results, the companies plan to initiate a global Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study with the 10µg dose, in combination with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant, in the coming weeks. This Phase 3 trial is expected to enroll more than 35,000 adult participants from a broad range of countries and will assess the efficacy of two vaccine formulations including the D614 (Wuhan) and B.1.351 (South African) variants.

>In parallel, the companies intend to conduct booster studies with various variant formulations in order to assess the ability of a lower dose of the vaccine to generate a strong booster response regardless of the initial vaccine platform received.

>Pending positive Phase 3 outcomes and regulatory reviews, the vaccine is expected to be approved in the fourth quarter of 2021.",nebeyb,2021-05-17 10:18:05

>**Objectives**: To assess the relative immunogenicity of standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who received standard or extended interval double vaccination.

>**Setting**: Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.

>**Participants**: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.

>**Main outcome measures**: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and cellular immune responses.

>**Results**: In donors without evidence of previous infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were 3.6-fold lower.

>**Conclusion**: Peak antibody responses after the second BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long term immunity and clinical protection.",nek9yi,2021-05-17 17:11:26

"**Abstract**  
The COVID-19 pandemic, has led to questions regarding the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, which may lead to transmission, amongst passengers on an aircraft, and the safety of travelers. It is difficult to determine the potential exposure risk using available computational fluid dynamics models or contact tracing methods, due to the lack of experimental validation of aerosol transport in the aircraft environment and the lack of detailed tracking of human interactions in aircraft. Using fluorescent aerosol tracers between 1-3 µm and real time optical sensors, coupled with DNA-tagged tracers to measure aerosol deposition, we completed the largest aircraft aerosol experimental validation testing to date, with 8 days of testing involving both inflight and ground tests on Boeing 777-200 and 767-300 airframes.

  
Tracer aerosols were released from a simulated infected passenger, in multiple rows and seats, to determine their risk of exposure and penetration into breathing zones of nearby seats. In particular, penetration into the breathing zones of passengers seated in the same row and in numerous rows in front and back of the source were measured. Over 300 aerosol release tests were performed repeatedly releasing 180,000,000 fluorescent tracer particles from the aerosol source (simulated virus aerosol), with 40+ Instantaneous Biological Analyzer and Collector (IBAC) sensors placed in passenger breathing zones for real-time measurement of simulated virus particle penetration. In total, more than 11,500 breathing zone seat measurements were taken with releases in 46 seats of the airframes.

  
Results from the Boeing 777-200 and 767-300 airframes showed a minimum reduction of 99.7% of 1 µm simulated virus aerosol from the index source to passengers seated directly next to the source. An average 99.99% reduction was measured for the 40+ breathing zones tested in each section of both airframes. Rapid dilution, mixing and purging of aerosol from the index source was observed due to both airframes’ high air exchange rates, downward ventilation design, and HEPA-filtered recirculation. Contamination of surfaces from aerosol sources was minimal, and DNA-tagged 3 µm tracers agreed well with real-time fluorescent results.",negz7v,2021-05-17 15:00:41
"I was curious to see how much of a difference active ventilation made, but couldn't find it in the paper.

Looking through the report it looked like there was one test where they had the ventilation completely off (777 Terminal testing - test 2) but that was due to an malfunction and I couldn't find any results specifically from that test.

They tested with the source in varying rows, but I was surprised to see that they only tested emissions from the middle block of seats rather than a seat near a side wall.",negz7v,2021-05-17 21:19:02
"The revision added this summary:
> Taken in context, the data from this study indicate that the airplane environment significantly reduces the exposure to aerosol generated by passengers, especially compared to other indoor environments. However, **the current established scientific understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is not sufficient to calculate definitive SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from these measurements of aerosol transport.**

Apparently, there was some controversy regarding interpretation of their findings.",negz7v,2021-05-18 07:10:49
"The ventilation-off scenario seems the most concerning really. Quite common for ventilation not to be operating for a while when the aircraft is on the ground, especially if takeoff is delayed. Something like this well-known [flu outbreak](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/463858/) would be highly undesirable.

>A jet airliner with 54 persons aboard was delayed on the ground for three hours because of engine failure during a takeoff attempt. Most passengers stayed on the airplane during the delay. Within 72 hours, 72 per cent of the passengers became ill with symptoms of cough, fever, fatigue, headache, sore throat and myalgia. One passenger, the apparent index case, was ill on the airplane, and the clinical attack rate among the others varied with the amount of time spent aboard. Virus antigenically similar to A/Texas/1/77(H3N2) was isolated from 8 of 31 passengers cultured, and 20 of 22 ill persons tested had serologic evidence of infection with this virus. The airplane ventilation system was inoperative during the delay and this may account for the high attack rate.",negz7v,2021-05-18 09:23:21

Has there been any further information about the divergence in CD8+ production between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2? If I remember correctly Pfizer-BioNTech beat Moderna in that regard.,nejiy5,2021-05-17 17:28:40
"**Abstract**

SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccines mediate protection from severe disease as early as 10 days post prime vaccination, when specific antibodies are hardly detectable and still lack neutralizing activity. Vaccine-induced T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, may thus be the main mediators of protection at this early stage. The details of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell induction after prime/boost vaccination, their comparison to naturally induced CD8+ T cell responses and their association with other arms of vaccine-induced adaptive immunity remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show on a single epitope level that both, a stable memory precursor pool of spike-specific CD8+ T cells and fully functional spike-specific effector CD8+ T cell populations, are vigorously mobilized as early as one week after prime vaccination when CD4+ T cell and spike-specific antibody responses are still weak and neutralizing antibodies are lacking. Boost vaccination after 3 weeks induced a full-fledged recall expansion generating highly differentiated CD8+ effector T cells, however, neither the functional capacity nor the memory precursor T cell pool was affected. Compared to natural infection, vaccine-induced early memory T cells exhibited similar frequencies and functional capacities but a different subset distribution dominated by effector memory T cells at the expense of self-renewing and multipotent central memory T cells. Our results indicate that spike-specific CD8+ T cells may represent the major correlate of early protection after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA/bnt162b2 prime vaccination that precede other effector arms of vaccine-induced adaptive immunity and are stably maintained after boost vaccination.",nejiy5,2021-05-17 16:41:08

"***Abstract:*** Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in humans. Despite several emerging vaccines, there remains no verifiable therapeutic targeted specifically to the virus. Here we present a highly effective siRNA therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel lipid nanoparticle delivery system. 

**Multiple small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were screened and three candidate siRNAs emerged that effectively inhibit virus by greater than 90% either alone or in combination with one another.** We simultaneously developed and screened two novel lipid nanoparticle formulations for the delivery of these candidate siRNA therapeutics to the lungs, an organ that incurs immense damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

**Encapsulation of siRNAs in these LNPs followed by in vivo injection demonstrated robust repression of virus in the lungs and a pronounced survival advantage to the treated mice.** Our LNP-siRNA approaches are scalable and can be administered upon the first sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. We suggest that an siRNA-LNP therapeutic approach could prove highly useful in treating COVID-19 disease as an adjunctive therapy to current vaccine strategies.",neitb9,2021-05-17 16:18:45

">**Abstract**

>SARS-CoV-2 mutations may diminish vaccine-induced protective immune responses, and the durability of such responses has not been previously reported. Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of the impact of variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, and B.1.526 on binding, neutralizing, and ACE2-blocking antibodies elicited by the vaccine mRNA-1273 over seven months. Cross-reactive neutralizing responses were rare after a single dose of mRNA-1273. At the peak of response to the second dose, all subjects had robust responses to all variants. Binding and functional antibodies against variants persisted in most subjects, albeit at low levels, for 6 months after the primary series of mRNA-1273. Across all assays, B.1.351 had the greatest impact on antibody recognition, and B.1.1.7 the least. These data complement ongoing studies of clinical protection to inform the potential need for additional boost vaccinations.",ne0wx8,2021-05-17 00:27:19

"First an anecdote, then a question: 

There was a study last week (I’ll post it when I find it) that, if I recall correctly, measured immune response to COVID infection 12 months out. Again if I recall correctly, it found very little change in antibody neutralization between 6 and 12 months. 

Now, this is different for a whole host of reasons. Notably, this is vaccination, which may be different. And this was tested again variants, which may be different. But in general, in context it feels promising. If, similar that other study, immune response is similarly robust at 12 months as 6 months, that’s hugely significant for durability of protection. 

Now the question: we see measure of neutralizing activity over and over again. Do we know why that measure is of primary importance? What about binding activity? Especially to the S-2P, binding appears remarkably consistent over time. Does that tell us anything about protection?",ne0wx8,2021-05-17 12:46:23

">	mRNA-1273-elicited neutralizing antibody activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants persisted six months after the second dose, albeit at reduced levels compared to WA1 and D614G, with more than half of subjects maintaining neutralizing activity against B.1.351 at the latest timepoint tested. High levels of binding antibodies recognizing B.1.351, as well as B.1.1.7, 10 P.1, B.1.429, and B.1.526 were maintained in all subjects over this time period. The impact of variants on antibody recognition was consistent over time and across age groups.

Obligatory ‘I’m not a doctor or biomedical researcher’, but from what I can understand neutralizing antibodies (those that bind and destroy the virus directly) saw a slight decline after six months, but binding antibodies (those that tag a virus for the rest of the immune system to destroy) did not. 

This would lead me to believe that the vaccine might lose some effectiveness against mild cases of COVID, but retain most of its effectiveness against severe COVID. But of course, I may be entirely wrong.",ne0wx8,2021-05-17 12:29:51

"It’s neither good nor bad news, it sort of just is.

This study is finding that neutralization of variants is consistently maintained across all variants for at least 6 months. However, some variants saw a greater and more relevant drop, like B.1.135. The takeaway from this is that it might be worth boosting (perhaps high risk groups) in regards to some variants ic this drop in titers results in a relevantly higher amount of infections and worse clinical outcomes caused by those variants, but we’ll have to wait and see. 

In particular, this is showing that no current variant can meaningfully evade vaccine induced immunity. But the duration of immunity is not consistent in regards to the variant involved.",ne0wx8,2021-05-17 14:17:01

Additional studies will be needed to address the impact of new variants that will surely arise in areas of intense viral infection, such as B.1.617 variants (identified in India). While the correlates of vaccine-induced protection are not yet known, our data are encouraging for the use of this vaccine in the face of viral variation

It's hard to draw any hard comparisons from this since 1) antibodies aren't the whole story w/ immunity, 2) it's nearly impossible to compare antibodies responses unless they're directly compared with the same procedure, and 3) Moderna and Pfizer/Biontech seem to be taking different approaches to boosting. Moderna is testing  boosters specific for B.1.351 while Pfizer is testing another dose of the exact same vaccine.",ne0wx8,2021-05-17 03:48:51
"Positive for sure as they found the Moderna vaccine will neutralize the known variants 2weeks after 2nd dose as expected.  However, they did find by 6 months post 2nd-dose(+2wks) neutralization lowers.  Of most concern is neutralization of the S.African variant drops to 54% (at least on one of their tests).  So it definitely seems like a booster in the fall would be smart.  
 
____  
All Day 209 sera neutralized D614G and B.1.429 in this assay, but fewer sera neutralized the other variants, with 96%, 88%, 85%, and 54% of sera neutralizing B.1.1.7, B.1.526, P.1, and B.1.351 respectively.

____
**Also of note:** They found that 1 dose did not do particularly well at neutralizing the variants.  Therefore, unlike the recent paper that suggests benefit of holding on the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, they recommend the 2nd dose be administered as suggested (4weeks after first):  
  
""at day 29 (4 weeks after the first dose), all subjects had binding antibodies against
all variants tested, but only 2 of 24 sera (8%) could neutralize B.1.351 in pseudovirus or livevirus neutralization assays, and 33-54% could neutralize B.1.1.7 in the two assays respectively.
10 While a single dose of mRNA-1273 provides partial protection against COVID-19 disease in the
interval prior to the second vaccination (34), and similar data were reported for the mRNA
vaccine BNT162b2 (16, 17), our observation of the limited magnitude and breadth of
neutralizing activity at Day 29 underscores the importance of the full two-dose regimen of an
mRNA vaccine for protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants""",ne0wx8,2021-05-17 03:39:22

* Claims by this doctor that he has never seen a covid patient, planned pandemic etc ([https://drtrozzi.com/](https://drtrozzi.com/))

I have to say though that I am somewhat grateful for the debate as it's made me less lazy to the covid situation and ultimately better informed.

**One thing in particular that I was hoping someone could help me to understand is PCR testing and the idea that the covid infection rates have been intentionally or otherwise exaggerated.** Further to that, they claim deaths have been attributed to covid when other factor like a heart attack or car accident or something was the actual cause. My in law's opinion would be that the hospital could get additional funding for patients labelled as covid or that the health care experts (I'm in Canada) are on the payroll for big pharma and are incentivized to beef up the pandemic numbers to increase interest in vaccines.

"I heard an interesting argument questioning whether initiating a large scale vaccine campaign using The mRNA vaccine after the wild type virus has mutated was a good idea.  There are a few key points:
1.  The vaccine creates a partial immune response against the wild type virus. Therefore, people still get infected and shed virus, they just have minimal to no symptoms. 
2. The vaccine mRNA codes for the glycoprotein spike on the wild type virus, not the mutants. 
3.  Because people can still get infected with both the wild type virus and the mutants, there is potentially an evolutionary playground for the virus to mutate into variants that can evade the immune response and be far more virulent. 
4. Because there are several variants/mutants, it will be difficult to impossible to achieve herd immunity.

"> disrupting some function of spike proteins

The spike is something the virus uses to exploit your cell receptors, it's not something innate that exists in your body.

> Is there a risk of causing significant harm to the body in the first place?

Not significantly, that's why they went forward with approval.

Basically the one thing a vaccine can do to cause long term harm would be to induce an autoimmune condition, where the immunogen (the protein the vaccine 'trains' the immune system to attack) is too similar to a host protein. An instance where a vaccine caused this were cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome after a flu vaccine. It wasn't discovered in trials because the reaction was still quite rare - about as common as Guillain-Barre caused by the flu itself for the same reason (the flu vaccine being inactivated whole flu virus, it has the same proteins as the live virus). But here's the thing - while this is a ""long term"" reaction, it's still something that would be observed to appear right as the immune response to the vaccine is at its peak, about 10-14 days after dosing.

There was hypothetical potential for that here since we do know that COVID-19 can induce autoimmune conditions, and that's exactly where the choice by western vaccine researchers to use recombinant vaccines that only selected the spike protein came from. They knew from SARS/MERS research that this was the focus of the ""good"" immune response, and that the spike does not resemble any human proteins at all. An antivax doctor's claims that it resembles a human placenta gene are just baseless - neither vaccination nor infection causes any effect on this function.",neebp7,2021-05-20 22:51:45

There may also be some Scotty principle here, they might be able to deliver earlier, but the last thing they want to do is promise before fall 2021 and then have to say they're not ready on that investor call.

I also don't know how enrollment is doing. It might be slower than expected if people are seeing cases drop even at the current levels of vaccination and thinking the risk of entering their own kids isn't worth it.",neebp7,2021-05-17 18:44:52

I believe J&J's multi-dose trial (still ongoing) does include a cohort given the second dose at 6 months so I would guess that we'll get some good data on whether J&J recipients benefit strongly from a booster. If I had to predict: I would bet they still have an antibody titer comparable to infection at that point (which we know is highly protective from reinfection) but that a booster would enhance the strength and breadth of neutralization (just as we've seen from trials of boosting the mRNA vaccines, or giving vaccines to the previously infected).

">One thing in particular that I was hoping someone could help me to understand is PCR testing and the idea that the covid infection rates have been intentionally or otherwise exaggerated.

Are you asking about how PCR testing works? The short of it is that they stick a swab up your nose to get some mucus which is likely to have SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in it if you are infected and put the mucus sample in a machine with chemicals that are specially designed to replicate a portion of genetic code that is known to be unique to SARS-CoV-2. If virus particles are in your mucus sample, their genetic code will keep growing in the machine until they can be detected by the machine. If there are no virus particles, there is nothing to replicate, so nothing will grow to be detected. Because of the way it works, false positives are very rare, and certainly wouldn't explain a situation where something like 15% of tests were turning up positive at points over the winter. Further, ignoring the *science* of why PCR tests work and if we imagined it were possible to have huge numbers of false positives or forgeries, it wouldn't make sense that COVID positivity rates and measured case counts from PCR testing would go up right before hospitalizations and deaths would go up, both regionally and throughout the country. What was causing those hospitalizations and deaths if not COVID?

>Further to that, they claim deaths have been attributed to covid when other factor like a heart attack or car accident or something was the actual cause.

There is absolutely zero evidence of this. The origin of the myth is that both COVID and another health condition like pneumonia would frequently appear as joint cause of death, obviously because COVID can directly cause other deadly conditions like pneumonia or organ failure so you *really do* have both COVID and pneumonia as a cause of death in a lot of people, and that is correctly attributed to COVID in CDC and NIH statistics. The original conspiracy was that when you saw two conditions being recorded as cause of death, the non-COVID condition like pneumonia was the ""real"" cause of death and COVID was just being added on either because they happened to test positive or just as a total fiction as part of some conspiracy. Seemingly this later got mutated into a myth that even completely unrelated deaths like car accidents are just having COVID tacked onto them.

The obvious way you can tell that it's not just a coincidence that people happen to be dying while also having COVID is that far more people than usual have been dying *in total* compared to previous years. The CDC has created a helpful [excess deaths tool](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) where you can see that over the winter, twenty to thirty thousand more people were dying each week than died in previous years. So if they're not dying of COVID, what are they dying of? To attribute the bulk of this to anything other than COVID would take an absolutely extraordinary explanation - either the CDC running a massive conspiracy, or a completely unidentified and mysterious cause of mass death that just so happened to perfectly coincide with COVID cases spiking.

But unfortunately I don't think you're going to convince someone with a masters in biology who is spouting these types of things. They've probably already been exposed to the correct information and just refuse to believe it, sadly.",neebp7,2021-05-20 20:37:59

"Moderna has a vaccine candidate in development based on the B.1.351 variant first seen in South Africa -- which is the variant currently believed closest to escaping immunity.

If a different variant surfaced, once the mutated virus was sequenced it would be a matter of days to produce the ""code"" for the modified mRNA, and perhaps weeks before the first doses suitable for testing in humans became available.

The time required to confirm safety and effectiveness would likely be the limiting factor in getting it widely available.

"Not to get anecdotal here but there is an ongoing Q and A with Professor Vincent Racaniello and Virologist Amy Rosenfeld who are saying that it's too early to lift the mask mandate because the US has not reached the 70 percent mark for herd immunity.

The messaging behind this move made by the CDC has been confusing because Dr. Fauci and the CDC has expressed their comfort in making this decision while other epidemiologists aren't so sure about this with some like American science journalist Laurie Garrett saying that this is going to lead to another surge because of people's carelessness. 

I guess this is just making me confused again as a layperson because the message seems very mixed and confusing overall in general making it harder to find out what is truthful and what isn't.

I again realize that discussing about masks is off limits and I probably do deserve to be warned about talking about masks but this is about the reasons for why the CDC has come out in favor of the new policy because increasing evidence as you mentioned is showing that vaccinations are significantly reducing transmission of the virus.

There were 6 men as well. But these 6 men were not dropped from the end recommendation. They have not recommended that all men get JJ.

"I think I follow what you are trying to say, however, this is the proposed difference in outcome:

Unvaccinated:
1.  Infection with a novel virus. 
2. Disease in the vulnerable: First wave. 
3. Disease in the previously asymptotic infected: Second and Third waves. 
4. Acquired herd immunity
5. Pandemic under control

Vaccinated:
1. Infection with a novel virus 
2. Vaccinate those in the vulnerable group
3. Vaccine will leads to decreased morbidity and mortality in the vulnerable and the previously asymptotic infected at the cost of herd immunity. 
4. Because there is no herd immunity, transmission of variants to the previously vaccinated and previously asymptotic infected
5. Due to evolutionary pressures, vaccine resistant strains may develop and transmit
6. Increased morbidity and mortality in the previously vaccinated and previously asymptotic infected


You may be wondering, why wouldn’t herd immunity develop more quickly in the second scenario?  For several reasons. By virtue of there being a large portion of the population having been vaccinated, it is less likely that asymptomatically infected persons will become re-infected shortly after their primary infection. This is to say that mass vaccination of the vulnerable will make it increasingly unlikely that previously asymptomatically infected persons become re-infected while experiencing substantial suppression of their natural Abs (as suboptimal, S-specific Ab titers rapidly decline in the majority of asymptomatically infected people). Hence, the likelihood that this part of the population contracts Covid-19 disease as a result of re-exposure will, therefore, shrink as well.


The more mass vaccination of the vulnerable group advances, the higher the chance for previously asymptomatically infected subjects to become re-exposed to Sars-CoV-2 at a point in time where their suboptimal S-specific Ab titers are no longer high enough to sufficiently block their natural Abs to cause Covid-19 disease but are still high enough to exert immune pressure on viral infectiousness.  This creates evolutionary pressure on the virus. 

Additionally, the vaccine is only effective on the wild type spike protein, not a mutated version of the spike protein.",neebp7,2021-05-24 00:50:46

However whether the risk that antivaxers will take the cue to unmask and continue spreading amongst themselves is greater than the reward of encouraging vaccination by the hesitant who are sitting at home thinking ""why bother getting vaccinated if they're going to make me wear masks forever?"" is a matter of messy opinion.

Epidemiologists are all over the map and - just my opinion at this point - many of their models don't take into account realistic durability of immunity, no. Some at the extreme end are still of the ""immunity after infection is nonexistent or lasts less than three months"" mindset. But some do. Early in the pandemic there was very little intersection between epidemiologists and immunologists in terms of communication.

And the reason that this is could be an issue with the mRNA vaccine is that the mRNA vaccine is so highly specific to the spike protein on the wild type virus.  The advantage is that these vaccine are so easy to mass produce.",neebp7,2021-05-24 01:16:35

"No, not where I was going with that.  If you are able to robustly suppress the virus when it exists in its wild form and its wild form only, then there is a good chance for the population to acquire herd immunity, and a good chance you will suppress the development of mutants.  However, if you introduce a vaccine that very specifically targets the wild type virus in the setting of mutants already existing, then it is very unlikely the population will achieve herd immunity through vaccination (because of the variants).  Moreover, those that had the infection from the wild type and were asymptotic, are less likely to develop long lasting immunity, because asymptotic folks develop less of an antibody response, and they less likely to be challenged in the short term.",neebp7,2021-05-24 02:06:10

">**Abstract**

>Highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants recently identified in India designated B.1.617 and B.1.618 have mutations within the spike protein that may contribute to their increased transmissibility and that could potentially result in re-infection or resistance to vaccine-elicited antibody. B.1.617 encodes a spike protein with mutations L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R while the B.1.618 spike has mutations Δ145-146, E484K and D614G. We generated lentiviruses pseudotyped by the variant proteins and determined their resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, vaccine-elicited antibodies and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Viruses with B.1.617 and B.1.618 spike were neutralized with a 2-5-fold decrease in titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies. The E484Q and E484K versions were neutralized with a 2-4-fold decrease in titer. Virus with the B.1.617 spike protein was neutralized with a 4.7-fold decrease in titer by the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail as a result of the L452R mutation. The modest neutralization resistance of the variant spike proteins to vaccine elicited antibody suggests that current vaccines will remain protective against the B.1.617 and B.1.618 variants.",ne0vd6,2021-05-17 00:25:20

Thanks for your response and I have read up on why prefusion is the better of the two.

Not sure what you mean by ""different configurations""-- here, stabilization refers to the prefusion confomation; as far as I know, nobody would want to stabilize it at the postfusion one. Heh.

I think full-length would mean the full spike protein, as opposed to subunit one. Novavax is a subunit type vaccine.",ne0vd6,2021-05-17 16:26:01

I guess this goes back to my original question of if the mRNA methods produce the prefusion form and show good response to VoCs then other vaccines without the modifications (such as AZ) should also hold their own water for the variants in the same way, hence the speculative claim in the OPs paper?",ne0vd6,2021-05-17 17:14:12
"> demonstrate that the prefusion form is presented on the surface of the cell?

So the vaccine makes the cells display Spike on their surface. When expressed, Spike by default will be at prefusion. Only when it binds to a receptor, like ACE2, will it change to postfusion. In the stabilized form, it will not change its conformation to postfusion.

>other vaccines without the modifications

So, sadly this cannot hold as such. Prefusion stabilization provides a better immune response. That is not to say AZ is not effective in its own right, just that prefusion stability provides better immunogenicity.",ne0vd6,2021-05-17 17:35:08

">At age 81, the patient was diagnosed with his first episode of UEDVT in 2017

You do not understand what the problem is here. the Problem is one of terminology.

"**Abstract**

Although antivirals are important tools to control the SARS-CoV-2 infection, effective vaccines are essential to control the current pandemic. Plant-derived virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates have previously demonstrated immunogenicity and efficacy against influenza. Here we report the immunogenicity and protection induced in macaques by intramuscular injections of VLP bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (CoVLP) vaccine candidate formulated with or without Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) or cytosine phosphoguanine (CpG) 1018. Although a single dose of unadjuvanted CoVLP vaccine candidate stimulated humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, booster immunization (at 28 days after prime) and adjuvants significantly improved both responses with a higher immunogenicity and protection provided by AS03 adjuvanted CoVLP. Fifteen microgram CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 induced a balanced IL-2 driven response along with IL-4 expression in CD4 T cells and mobilization of CD4 follicular helper cells (Tfh). Animals were challenged by multiple routes (i.e. intratracheal, intranasal and ocular) with a total viral dose of 106 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2. Lower viral replication in nasal swabs and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) as well as fewer SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and immune cell infiltrates in the lungs concomitant with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors in BAL were observed in the animals immunized with CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03. No clinical, pathologic or virologic evidences of vaccine associated enhanced disease (VAED) were observed in vaccinated animals. CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 was therefore selected for vaccine development and clinical trials.

We have a significant portion of the population that cannot be vaccinated now. Public messaging is: ""kids are safe, even if they get Covid"". That's irresponsible messaging. We don't really know. To think otherwise is hubris. 

Heck, we don't even know why initial symptoms are usually mild in children. We have some ideas, but it's far from proven.

In the meantime, parents have to make decisions now, on limited information. Those decisions shouldn't be based on scientifically dubious speculation just in advance of an opportunity to dramatically reduce risk to their kids with a vaccine. 

Now, the message some here are parroting is that I'm making scientifically dubious claims in saying there is some long term risk.

">**Abstract**

>SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are raging worldwide. Unfortunately, the global vaccination is not efficient enough to attain a vaccine-based herd-immunity and yet no special and effective drug is developed to contain the spread of the disease. Previously we have identified CD147 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrated that CD147 antibody effectively inhibits infection and cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants. In CD147KO VeroE6 cells, infections of SARS-CoV-2, its variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351) and pseudovirus mutants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.525, B.1.526 (S477N), B.1.526 (E484K), P.1, P.2, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2) were decreased. Meanwhile, CD147 antibody effectively blocked the entry of variants and pseudomutants in VeroE6 cells, and inhibited the expression of cytokines. A model of SARS-CoV-2-infected hCD147 transgenic mice was constructed, which recapitulated the features of exudative diffuse alveolar damage and dynamic immune responses of COVID-19. CD147 antibody could effectively clear the virus and alveolar exudation, resolving the pneumonia. We found the elevated level of cyclophilin A (CyPA) in plasma of severe/critical cases, and identified CyPA as the most important proinflammatory intermediate causing cytokine storm. Mechanistically, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to CD147 and initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which induced expression of CyPA. CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147, triggered MAPK pathway and consequently mediated the expression of cytokine and chemokine. In conclusion, CD147 is a critical target for SARS-CoV-2 variants and CD147 antibody is a promising drug to control the new wave of COVID-19 epidemic.",nd2hxu,2021-05-15 17:19:55

"Abstract

Objective

We evaluated whether ivermectin combined with doxycycline reduced the clinical recovery time in adults with COVID-19 infection.

Methods

This was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms randomly assigned to treatment (n = 200) and placebo (n = 200) groups. The primary outcome was duration from treatment to clinical recovery. Secondary outcomes were disease progression and persistent COVID-19 positivity by RT-PCR.

Results

Among 556 screened patients, 400 were enrolled and 363 completed follow-up. The mean patient age was 40 years, and 59% were men. The median recovery time was 7 (4–10, treatment group) and 9 (5–12, placebo group) days (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.90). The number of patients with a ≤7-day recovery was 61% (treatment group) and 44% (placebo groups) (hazard ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.09). The proportion of patients who remained RT-PCR positive on day 14 and whose disease did not progress was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection treated with ivermectin plus doxycycline recovered earlier, were less likely to progress to more serious disease, and were more likely to be COVID-19 negative by RT-PCR on day 14.",ncwjld,2021-05-15 12:17:15

">Conclusion

>The persistent symptoms associated with COVID-19 are frustrating for patients who just want to be normal, to return to their previous level of function prior to COVID-19. Unfortunately there are no clear answers for them at this time and NPs should share this with them. Alternative explanations for symptoms need to be ruled out prior associating the symptoms with long-haul COVID-19. If a COVID-19 care center is available, patients should be referred. If a COVID-19 care center is not available, specialists need to be consulted. Given the impact on mental health, evaluating the mental health of long-haulers is a priority.

>More research is needed regarding the long-haulers of COVID-19. More than 27 million Americans have already been infected with COVID-19 and there have been more than 106 million cases globally.34 Given that 10% of patients with acute COVID-19 are predicted to become long-haulers2, the number of patients presenting to primary care with persistent symptoms will be the next wave of the pandemic.

"**Abstract**

Background: Covid-19 vaccines are urgently needed, especially against emerging variants. NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 rS) nanoparticle vaccine containing trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant. 


Methods: A phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults 18-84 years old who received two intramuscular 5-mcg doses, 21 days apart, of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo (1:1) across 33 sites in the United Kingdom. The primary efficacy endpoint was virologically confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 with onset 7 days after second vaccination in serologically negative participants. 


Results: A total of 15,187 participants were randomized, of whom 7569 received NVX-CoV2373 and 7570 received placebo; 27.2% were 65 years or older, 44.7% had comorbidities and 4.2% had baseline serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2. There were 10 cases of Covid-19 among NVX-CoV2373 recipients and 96 cases among placebo recipients, with symptom onset at least 7 days after second vaccination; NVX-CoV2373 was 89.7% (95% confidence interval, 80.2 to 94.6) effective in preventing Covid-19, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported. There were five cases of severe Covid-19, all in the placebo group. Post hoc analysis revealed efficacies of 96.4% (73.8 to 99.5) and 86.3% (71.3 to 93.5) against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant, respectively. Vaccine efficacy was similar across subgroups, including participants with comorbidities and those ≥65 years old. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. 


Conclusion: A two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 conferred **89.7% protection** against a blend of prototype and variant Covid-19, demonstrated high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant, and had a reassuring safety profile.",ncs69p,2021-05-15 07:23:44
"These results have been known for a while from the company's press release, but it's good they finally got around to writing them up.

"Summary
What is already known about this topic?

Health care personnel (HCP) are at high risk for COVID-19. The early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to HCP provided an opportunity to examine vaccine effectiveness in a real-world setting.

What is added by this report?

The first U.S. multisite test-negative design vaccine effectiveness study among HCP found a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to be 82% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 and 2 doses to be 94% effective.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 among U.S. HCP. High vaccination coverage among HCP and the general population is critical to prevent COVID-19 in the United States.",ncyfnr,2021-05-16 15:25:58

">**Abstract**

>The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617 with double mutations E484Q and L452R in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein is worrisome. Demonstrated in crystal structures, the residues 452 and 484 in RBD are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, the E484Q and L452R mutations might not significantly affect RBD's binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without the known molecular mechanism, these two successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) can be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using *in silico* all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation as well as deep learning (DL) approaches, here we show that these two mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between RBD and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab) that was proven to be efficacious for neutralizing the wide-type SARS-CoV-2. With the revealed molecular mechanism on how L452R and E484K evade LY-CoV555, we expect that more specific therapeutic antibodies can be accordingly designed and/or a precision mixing of antibodies can be achieved in a cocktail treatment for patients infected with the variant B.1.617.",ncwgqi,2021-05-15 12:10:31

"ABSTRACT

Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved with endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not affect endothelial activation. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.",ncqfbw,2021-05-15 05:08:16

  This is consistent with getting convalescent plasma BEFORE the disease progresses to the stage of hospitalization.  There are supplies of it but many are not asking for it to stave off higher viral loads.,nctuoz,2021-05-15 19:54:02
"Methods

This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) is assessing several possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 177 NHS hospitals from across the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either usual care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus high-titre convalescent plasma (convalescent plasma group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936.

Findings

Between May 28, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021, 11558 (71%) of 16287 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible to receive convalescent plasma and were assigned to either the convalescent plasma group or the usual care group. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1399 (24%) of 5795 patients in the convalescent plasma group and 1408 (24%) of 5763 patients in the usual care group died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·00, 95% CI 0·93–1·07; p=0·95). The 28-day mortality rate ratio was similar in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including in those patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at randomisation. Allocation to convalescent plasma had no significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days (3832 [66%] patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 3822 [66%] patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·94–1·03; p=0·57). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients meeting the composite endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death (1568 [29%] of 5493 patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 1568 [29%] of 5448 patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·93–1·05; p=0·79).

Interpretation

In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, high-titre convalescent plasma did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes.",nctuoz,2021-05-15 13:45:35

"[Auto-generated summary]

Understanding how to optimise COVID-19 vaccine schedules and maximise immune responses within this age group is vitally important.''  Corresponding author Paul Moss, Professor of Haematology at the University of Birmingham and Principal Investigator of the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, added: '' The enhanced antibody responses seen after an extended interval may help to sustain immunity against COVID-19 over the longer term and further improve the clinical efficacy of this powerful vaccine platform.The study, supported by the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, of 175 people who were aged over 80 and living independently is the first direct comparison of the immune response in any age group between those who are given the second Pfizer vaccine at a three-week interval and those at a 12-week interval. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Consultant Epidemiologist at PHE, said: ''The higher antibody responses in people receiving two doses of the Pfizer vaccine using an extended 12 week interval provides further supportive evidence of the benefits of the UK approach to prioritise the first dose of vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was originally authorised for a three-week interval between doses; however several countries, including the UK, chose to expand this to a 12-week interval to allow a higher percentage of the population to receive one vaccine dose quicker.",nbz8u1,2021-05-14 05:20:48
"It could be interesting to see what happens to people that had covid last year (first wave) when they get the vaccine.

Edit, it seems i've been misunderstood:
I'm curious of what a similar study on people like us could tell about antibody response... for exemple, do they really need two shots? They have a strongest or different reaction as antibody numbers and type?",nbz8u1,2021-05-14 09:45:34

Isn’t this the premise of booster shots?,nbz8u1,2021-05-14 10:43:54
I’m not an expert on this sort of study... is there a reason they didn’t measure antibody levels in the 3 week group at the same point in time (12-14 weeks) they measured the 12 week group and is there a reason they didn’t do subsequent T cell tests several weeks after the 12 week group (or both groups) so a more appropriate comparison could be made?  I suppose one wouldn’t expect antibodies in the 3 week group to increase 3 fold 12 weeks later but it just feels like an incomplete comparison.,nbz8u1,2021-05-14 13:07:29
"It's worth highlighting that they measured anti-spike antibodies rather than neutralizing antibodies, which is less informative.",nbz8u1,2021-05-15 19:37:22
">Although the peak cellular immune responses were lower after the delayed second vaccine, responses were comparable between the groups when measured at a similar time point following the first dose

So a possible short term benefit, increased antibodies, but a possible long term detriment, lower t-cell count. As long as vaccination reduces mortality the same amount these differences might not matter.",nbz8u1,2021-05-14 12:22:36

"Yeah, but that's 3 months when you only have partial protection instead of only 3 weeks. You can always get a booster shot later if needed. I don't think this is in the public's best interest, and even if it's too late to negatively impact vaccination status now, people may delay their second vaccine shots in the future and prolong outbreaks.",nbz8u1,2021-05-14 16:32:26

That strategy allows a country to vaccinate twice as many people with 70-80% efficacy and break the chain (as the UK has with a single dose campaign). There's a lot of criticism about not following the phase 3 tested dosing interval and not all of that criticism is unfounded.

I'm pretty sure this is the first study confirming the improved immune response theory and also confirming that their isn't an impaired immune response by delaying dosing with an mRNA vaccine.",nbz8u1,2021-05-14 05:38:16

"The second jab was always more important for long-term immunity than overall efficacy. It's likely that part of the reason most of the phase-3 trials went for 2-4 week gaps between doses was to try and get a readout on 2-dose efficacy 8 weeks earlier.

The concerns about the 12-week cap were primarily that it was an untested dosing regime (although in my opinion those concerns were very overstated at the time, I'm not aware of any vaccine that's less effective over a 12-week rather than a 3-week schedule).

As others have stated, the primary goal of the UK pioneering the 12-week gap was to _reduce_ infections, hospitalisations and deaths by giving more people a first dose (efficacy ~60-80%) rather than fewer people with two doses (effiacy ~90%).",nbz8u1,2021-05-14 14:39:13

"Quebec has been much more strongly hit previously and still is the most hit province by far of all Canada (when looking at total hospitalizations and deaths), especially Montreal. Now, it happens that a third wave in Quebec was very mild and focused in the least hit regions, and was mostly avoided in Montreal despite the B117 variant hitting that region way before the rest of Quebec.

The US and the UK have also avoided a significant spring wave for the most part unlike many western European countries, so there may be a pattern there where parts of the world that have been previously hit the hardest were more resistant. 

On the other end you have countries like Czechia that were almost not hit at all during the first wave, and that got three large waves (fall, jan and march). Its pattern is slightly reminiscent of the regions in Quebec that had almost no first wave, the region of Quebec City for instance didn't have a significant first wave and also had an early fall, late fall and spring wave. Czechia has experienced a high level of mortality unfortunately, perhaps as its waves were more concentrated in time, causing hospitalizations to spike very significantly.

We will need very serious studies into all this in the coming years, but in my opinion there are strong correlations between when cases rise and fall in various countries of similar latitudes, and there is the pattern I'm discussing here where some places seem to catch up to a degree with others. Maybe people behavior's change more when they see they're in one of the most hit place, and they tend to be more relaxed when it's the opposite, but maybe there are other factors, such as seasonal changes in immunity that explain some of the ebbs and flow, maybe variants to a degree, and maybe since the susceptibility to infections is not distributed homogeneously, a level of ""shield immunity"" is built up earlier than previously thought due to the most susceptible individuals (maybe a mix of natural factors affected innate immune defenses and of having the most indoors social contacts) being infected on average before the least susceptible ones.",nbz8u1,2021-05-14 13:57:08

"**Abstract**  

**Objectives**  

The purpose of this study was to detect cardiovascular changes after mild severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

**Background**  

Concern exists that mild coronavirus disease 2019 may cause myocardial and vascular disease.

**Methods**  

Participants were recruited from COVIDsortium, a 3-hospital prospective study of 731 health care workers who underwent first-wave weekly symptom, polymerase chain reaction, and serology assessment over 4 months, with seroconversion in 21.5% (n = 157). At 6 months post-infection, 74 seropositive and 75 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched seronegative control subjects were recruited for cardiovascular phenotyping (comprehensive phantom-calibrated cardiovascular magnetic resonance and blood biomarkers). Analysis was blinded, using objective artificial intelligence analytics where available.

**Results**  

A total of 149 subjects (mean age 37 years, range 18 to 63 years, 58% women) were recruited. Seropositive infections had been mild with case definition, noncase definition, and asymptomatic disease in 45 (61%), 18 (24%), and 11 (15%), respectively, with 1 person hospitalized (for 2 days). **Between seropositive and seronegative groups, there were no differences in cardiac structure** (left ventricular volumes, mass, atrial area), **function** (ejection fraction, global longitudinal shortening, aortic distensibility), **tissue characterization** (T1, T2, extracellular volume fraction mapping, late gadolinium enhancement) or **biomarkers** (troponin, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide). **With abnormal defined by the 75 seronegatives** (2 SDs from mean, e.g., ejection fraction <54%, septal T1 >1,072 ms, septal T2 >52.4 ms), individuals had abnormalities including reduced ejection fraction (n = 2, minimum 50%), T1 elevation (n = 6), T2 elevation (n = 9), late gadolinium enhancement (n = 13, median 1%, max 5% of myocardium), biomarker elevation (borderline troponin elevation in 4; all N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide normal). **These were distributed equally between seropositive and seronegative individuals.**

**Conclusions**  

Cardiovascular abnormalities are no more common in seropositive versus seronegative otherwise healthy, workforce representative individuals 6 months post–mild severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.",ncdq8q,2021-05-14 18:13:31

Reduced Flow-Mediated Dilatation Is Not Related to COVID-19 Severity Three Months after Hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 Infection

>In conclusion, reduced FMD is often observed even three months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but such alteration predominantly appears to not be related to COVID-19 severity. Longer and larger follow-up studies will help to clarify the potential prognosis value of FMD among COVID-19 patients, as well as to further determine the mechanisms involved.

"The UK's level of prevalence is too low for a more contagious strain to hide for long. 

According to [Covariants](https://covariants.org/per-country), B.1.617.2 made up 8% of sequenced cases for the most recent complete 2-week time period of April 19,  after being 1% the time period before.  Assuming sequenced cases are representative of the full country that's about 200 cases/day.
 If there's a doubling time of 1 week (R~1.5 with a 4-day serial interval) then we could have seen the constant cases that the UK has had over the last month,  but in the near future (2-4 weeks) we should start seeing a dramatic rise in cases around these clusters and in prevalence of B.1.617.2 nationally in the UK. 

But it is fully plausible what we're seeing is explainable by the confounding factor that everyone is trying to find B.1.617.2 infections coming from India. In that case UK cases should begin dropping soon given their ongoing vaccinations.",ncdkp7,2021-05-15 07:14:19

It's still a very small sample size, but an alarming one.  Surveyed prevalence shows B.1.617.2 increasing in absolute case count by about a factor of 10 over the last month everywhere it has been found for that long: India, the UK, the US, Bangladesh, Germany, and probably more.

I don’t believe the other vaccine companies submitted this same data, but I think it’s pretty well accepted that all approved vaccines in the US provide pretty robust sterilizing immunity for a period.

">CureVac N.V. (Nasdaq: CVAC), a global biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), today announced together with its collaboration partner GSK, first preclinical data in a rat model, showing that its second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, induces high levels of antigen production as well as strong and dose-dependent immune responses in vaccinated animals. CV2CoV is a co-development between CureVac and GSK and is based on a new mRNA backbone, which differs from CureVac’s first-generation vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, currently in late-stage clinical testing. Preclinical data in rats immunized with CV2CoV in the dose range of 0.5-40µg demonstrated fast onset of strong immune responses already after the first dose. In addition, the serum of vaccinated animals showed significant cross-neutralization against variants first discovered in Denmark (B.1.1.298), the UK (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351). The full manuscript of the preclinical data is available on the pre-print server bioRxiv.

>“mRNA technology has made tremendous progress since the clinical development of first-generation mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidates started in early 2020, “ said Dr. Igor Splawski, Chief Scientific Officer of CureVac. “Spurred by the emergence of virus variants that have the potential to affect the efficacy of currently approved first-generation mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, CureVac and GSK aim to jointly develop second-generation vaccine candidates that offer improved immune responses and target emerging variants. Combined with lower doses, these second-generation vaccines could enable also broad protection against selected strains in a multivalent vaccine format.”

>Roger Connor, president R&D GSK vaccines said ”to successfully fight the COVID-19 pandemic in the long term, we will need different vaccines and we need to be able to respond effectively to emerging variants. We are pleased with these pre-clinical results as they show the potential of the next generation mRNA technology we are developing together with CureVac.”

>CV2CoV is based on a new mRNA backbone that features targeted optimizations designed to improve intracellular mRNA stability and translation for increased and extended protein expression. These optimizations potentially allow for strong immune responses at low doses, which will support the development of multivalent vaccines to target rapidly spreading COVID-19 variants. First clinical trials for CV2CoV are expected to start in the third quarter of 2021.

>Development of CV2CoV is carried out in collaboration with GSK. The CureVac-GSK COVID-19 collaboration announced in February 2021 extends the existing strategic mRNA technology partnership both companies entered in July 2020. The partnership targets second-generation vaccines and those with the potential for a multivalent or combination approach to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine.",nbgsqn,2021-05-13 14:37:19

> **Abstract**

>More than a year after emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multiple first-generation vaccines are approved and available for vaccination. Still, many challenges remain. The ongoing vaccination programs across the globe suffer from insufficient vaccine supply. The virus is adapting to the human host and novel variants are circulating that are neutralised less efficiently by antibodies raised against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we describe CV2CoV, a second-generation mRNA vaccine developed for enhanced protein expression and immunogenicity. CV2CoV supports increased levels of protein expression in cell culture compared to our clinical candidate CVnCoV. Vaccination with CV2CoV induces high levels of virus neutralising antibodies with accelerated kinetics in rats. Robust antibody responses are reflected in significant cross-neutralisation of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, i.e. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Together, these results underline the value of CV2CoV as next-generation SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine",nbula3,2021-05-14 00:30:38

"ABSTRACT

Pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe SARS-CoV2 infection remain largely unelucidated. High throughput sequencing technologies that capture genome and transcriptome information are key approaches to gain detailed mechanistic insights from infected cells. These techniques readily detect both pathogen and host-derived sequences, providing a means of studying host-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have reported the presence of host-virus chimeric (HVC) RNA in RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and interpreted these findings as evidence of viral integration in the human genome as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Since SARS-CoV2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm it does not have a nuclear phase in its life cycle. Thus, it is biologically unlikely to be in a location where splicing events could result in genome integration. Therefore, we investigated the biological authenticity of HVC events. In contrast to true biological events such as mRNA splicing and genome rearrangement events, which generate reproducible chimeric sequencing fragments across different biological isolates, we found that HVC events across >100 RNA-seq libraries from patients with COVID-19 and infected cell lines were highly irreproducible. RNA-seq library preparation is inherently error-prone due to random template switching during reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA. By counting chimeric events observed when constructing an RNA-seq library from human RNA and spike-in RNA from an unrelated species, such as fruit-fly, we estimated that ∼1% of RNA-seq reads are artifactually chimeric. In SARS-CoV2 RNA-seq we found that the frequency of HVC events was, in fact, not greater than this background “noise”. Finally, we developed a novel experimental approach to enrich SARS-CoV2 sequences from bulk RNA of infected cells. This method enriched viral sequences but did not enrich for HVC events, suggesting that the majority of HVC events are, in all likelihood, artifacts of library construction. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HVC events observed in RNA-sequencing libraries from SARS-CoV2 infected cells are extremely rare and are likely artifacts arising from either random template switching of reverse-transcriptase and/or sequence alignment errors. Therefore, the observed HVC events do not support SARS-CoV2 fusion to cellular genes and/or integration into human genomes.",nbkhz3,2021-05-13 21:15:15

">**Abstract**  
>  
>Staying home and avoiding unnecessary contact is an important part of the effort to contain COVID-19 and limit deaths. Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals’ voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. **We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change.** For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. **However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic.** It is important to be able to attribute the relative role of self-interested behavior or policy mandates to understand the limits and opportunities for relying on voluntary behavior as opposed to imposing stay-at-home orders.

Some interesting parts from the conclusion as well:

>Understanding the relative role of policy and individual preferences in people’s changes in behavior is critical. T**he scientific and policy question is how much credit stay-at-home orders can take for the behavioral shifts and the associated reduction in contacts in the resulting pathogen spread or, conversely, how much blame these orders deserve for economic disruption.** These connected questions are important for three reasons. First, public health resources that could be used to detect and communicate local risks need to be allocated to the enforcement and defense of policy mandates when they are issued. **Second, nonpharmaceutical interventions are at times framed as lives versus the economy, but our results suggest that this framing is tenuous on its face for most counties because stay-at-home mandates overlapped with behavior that would have happened as cases rose.** Third, the measure of the equivalent cases requires a publicly knowable risk (e.g., COVID-19 cases reported in the county). **This implies that any appeal to our results for forgoing stay-at-home mandates must also advocate for high levels of testing and accurate and timely communication**",nbdcqt,2021-05-13 11:21:39

">**Abstract**

>Covishield comprises the larger proportion in the vaccination program in India. Hence, it is of utmost importance to understand neutralizing capability of vaccine against the B.1.617.1 variant which is considered to responsible for surge of the cases in India. The neutralizing-antibody (NAb) titer against B.1.167.1 and prototype B.1 variant (D614G) was determined of the vaccine sera (4 weeks after second dose) of COVID-19 naive subjects (n=43) and COVID-19 recovered subjects (n=18). The results demonstrated that sera of COVID-19 recovered subjects (n=18) who received two doses of Covishield have higher NAb response compared to the COVID-19 naive with a significant difference (p<0.0001) in NAb titer against B.1 and B.1.617.1 In-spite of reduction in the neutralizing titer against B.1.617.1 variant; Covishield vaccine-induced antibodies are likely to be protective to limit the severity and mortality of the disease in the vaccinated individuals.",nbbhco,2021-05-13 09:05:29

>The uncontrolled spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants across the globe. The ongoing global vaccination strategy to curtail the COVID-19 juggernaut, is threatened by the rapidly spreading Variants of Concern (VOC) and other regional mutants, which are less responsive to neutralization by infection or vaccine derived antibodies. We have previously developed the hiVNT system which detects SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in sera in less than three hours. In this study, we modify the hiVNT for rapid qualitative screening of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to multiple variants of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2, and assess the neutralizing efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on seven epidemiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we show that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine can activate humoral immunity against the major SARS-CoV-2 mutants that are currently in circulation. Albeit a small sample size, we observed that one dose of vaccine was sufficient to elicit a protective humoral response in previously infected people. Using a panel of seven SARS-CoV-2 variants and a single prototype virus, our modified hiVNT would be useful for large-scale community wide testing to detect protective immunity that may confer vaccine/immune passport in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",nbhm1g,2021-05-13 15:15:14

"Very interesting.  As a rank layman, any linkage to post viral fatigue syndrome mitochondrial disfunction?",nbf7ti,2021-05-13 15:29:36
">Patients with metabolic syndrome suffer from severe complications and a higher mortality rate due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We recently proposed that SARS-CoV-2 can hijack host mitochondrial function and manipulate metabolic pathways for their own advantage. The aim of the current study was to investigate functional mitochondrial changes in live peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 and to decipher the pathways of substrate utilization in these cells and corresponding changes in the inflammatory pathways. We demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic alterations with an increase in glycolysis, and high levels of mitokine in PBMCs from patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 mitokine correlate with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. These data suggest that patients with COVID-19 have a compromised mitochondrial function and an energy deficit that is compensated by a metabolic switch to glycolysis. This metabolic manipulation by SARS-CoV-2 triggers an enhanced inflammatory response that contributes to the severity of symptoms in COVID-19. Targeting mitochondrial metabolic pathway(s) can help define novel strategies for COVID-19.",nbf7ti,2021-05-13 13:14:30
"This paper seems to contradict these findings -

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.997254v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.997254v1)

But it may be that the glycolysis enhancing effect found is specific to people with a pre-existing metabolic dysfunction. 

Autophagy recycles nutrients which is normally tightly controlled to useful cellular growth and renewal, and a virus would certainly want to redirect the output of autophagy towards viral replication. SARS-Cov-2 is also the largest human RNA virus, so it must be taxing on the cell. 

Autophagy also is part of the cellular cleaning that clears rogue material including viruses, so on the other hand a virus would probably want to reduce it and redirect nutrients from other sources. Reducing the energy expenditure of the cell also would spare energy from normal cell activities to viral replication. 

So it will be interesting to see what else they find on that.

Stimulating mitochondrial replication also will compete for the material nutrients needed for constructing the virus, and that could be upregulated with PQQ.",nbf7ti,2021-05-13 23:48:58

< more on autophagy and the virus, you have to search for it though its a huge article

>Apparently, the blockade of autophagy by different types of viruses gives us an indication that viruses can manipulate autophagy for immune evasion. The notion that coronavirus requires the formation of double membrane vesicles to aid replication and transcription of the virus gives us an indication that the virus may usurp the autophagosomal machinery to facilitate the formation of double membrane vesicles (Carmona-Gutierrez et al., 2020). Thus, autophagosomes boost infection by assisting the assembly of viral replicase proteins (Cottam et al., 2011). This is further corroborated by the fact that viral nsp6 protein was found to colocalize with the endogenous LC3, indicating a possible co-relation between autophagy and coronavirus replication (Cottam et al., 2011; Bello-Perez et al., 2020). Also, it has been reported that coronaviruses can hijack the EDEMosome (vesicles for endoplasmic reticulum degradation) formation pathway via modulating the degradation of endoplasmic reticulum degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 1 (EDEM1) and OS-9 protein such that it causes accumulation of both the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) regulatory proteins and trap them into double-membrane vesicles (Reggiori et al., 2010). This indicates that if the virus evades autophagy, it can dynamically manipulate autophagy to promote the replication of the virus inside the host.

So it seems that the virus makes out its an autophagosome to ironically avoid being degraded by autophagy.

Block that process and upregulate autophagy, and you have a potential winning antiviral against coronaviruses. EDIT this is not a new idea and was part of the rationale of using chloriquine.",nbf7ti,2021-05-13 23:58:57

"**Abstract**


The city of Manaus, north Brazil, was stricken by a severe epidemic of SARS-Cov-2 in March 2020, reaching a seroprevalence of 76% by October 2020. Nevertheless, in late November an abrupt increase in hospitalizations and deaths hit Manaus, causing higher number of deaths compared to the first epidemic wave. It has been hypothesized that virus lineages circulating in the second wave, namely the P.1 variant of concern first detected in early December in Manaus, could be better at evading immunity generated in response to previous infection with other lineages. In order to estimate the reinfection rate during the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus, we tested serial samples from 238 unvaccinated repeat blood donors using a SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG chemiluminescence microparticle assay. Blood donors were divided into six groups that reflected the inferred sequence of infection and reinfection with non-P.1 and P.1 variants. We assumed that reinfections induce a recrudescence (or boosting) of plasma anti-N IgG antibody levels, yielding a V-shaped time series of antibody reactivity levels. We infer that 16.9% (95% CI [9.48%, 28.5%]) of all presumed P.1 infections that were observed in 2021 were reinfections. If we also include cases of probable or possible reinfections (defined by considering the time period when the antibody levels are expected to grow after recovery and the range of half-lives for antibody waning after seroconversion), these percentages increase respectively to 25.8% (95% CI [16.7%, 37.4%]), and 31.0% (95% CI [21.4%, 42.5%]). Our data suggest that reinfection due to P.1 is common and more frequent than what has been detected by traditional epidemiologic, molecular and genomic surveillance of clinical cases.",nb0mks,2021-05-12 22:59:47
"I'd really like to hear why they chose to use antibody levels as a surrogate for reinfection. By doing so, they've had to make some pretty big assumptions. I'd imagine it would be a lot more accurate to just measure viral load instead",nb0mks,2021-05-13 01:50:36

Interesting backstory here as this is a Canadian mRNA vaccine but has not received any support from the Canadian government. So whether this one actually makes it through a phase three trial is tenuous at the moment.,nb8x0j,2021-05-13 06:11:03
"> Interesting backstory here as this is a Canadian mRNA vaccine but has not received any support from the Canadian government. 

That backstory is completely false, though. They have received government support on multiple occasions, including some $10 million already given to them through Canada's National Research Council, and are included in the list of domestic firms to which the NRC's Industrial Research Assistance Program has already confirmed that additional support for Phase II trials will be made available. 

The idea that they have not received any support at all is being perpetuated by the firm's huckster CEO (Sorenson), who seems to believe that the government not having agreed to provide him with ~$150 million up front is the same as him being cruelly ignored. This is in spite of the support already described above, and the fact that he is routinely able to address parliamentary committee hearings to issue his demands. It is nakedly deceitful for him to keep insisting to credulous media outlets that the government won't return his calls when in fact he is able to directly address lawmakers almost at a whim. They just aren't interested in dumping that kind of money into a company that has no relevant production record, that did not initially have any means of producing the planned vaccines, that would be relying on ingredients sourced from another company (Northern RNA) that also has no significant history, and whose only other active projects are prospective cancer vaccines that they describe as being ""still in the discovery phase."" 

The basis for *those* vaccines may also call the company into doubt, seeing as Sorensen's most notable public activity in this space prior to COVID was [to be implicated in a vaccine IP plunder scandal](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/28/1454760/0/en/Arcturus-Therapeutics-Issues-Open-Letter-to-Shareholders.html) that saw the CEO of Arcturus Therapeutics fired from his own company and Sorenson himself accused of multiple ethics breaches and suspicious trading activity.

I was hoping these results would be posted here by someone because they deserve to be critically examined. If they're legitimate, and this vaccine seems like it should be promising, great -- but there is ample reason to wonder.",nb8x0j,2021-05-13 15:53:36

The study that I'll want to see at some point is mix and match on boosters given at, say, nine months or a year.

">**Abstract**

>**Background**

>Recent reports demonstrate robust serological responses to a single dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Data on immune responses following a single-dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection are however limited, and current guidelines recommend a two-dose regime regardless of preexisting immunity.

>**Methods**

>We compared spike-specific IgG and pseudo-neutralizing spike-ACE2 blocking antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P1 following two doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 and a single dose of the adenovector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 232 healthcare workers with and without previous COVID-19.

>**Findings**

>The post-vaccine levels of spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild type and all three variants of concern were similar or higher in participants receiving a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine post SARS-CoV-2 infection (both < 11 months post infection (n=37) and ≥ 11 months infection (n=46)) compared to participants who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (n=149).

Individuals with acute malaria infection generated high levels of antibodies that cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.

Syk inhibitors seem to work against severe COVID19


https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/rigel-fostamatinib-primary-endpoint/",nal7cc,2021-05-12 15:05:12
">Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) become critically ill primarily around the time of activation of the adaptive immune response. Here, we provide evidence that antibodies play a role in the worsening of disease at the time of seroconversion. We show that early phase severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein-specific IgG in serum of critically ill COVID-19 patients induces excessive inflammatory responses by human alveolar macrophages. We identified that this excessive inflammatory response is dependent on two antibody features that are specific for patients with severe COVID-19. First, inflammation is driven by high titers of anti-spike IgG, a hallmark of severe disease. Second, we found that anti-spike IgG from patients with severe COVID-19 is intrinsically more pro-inflammatory because of different glycosylation, particularly low fucosylation, of the antibody Fc tail. Notably, low fucosylation of anti-spike IgG was normalized in a few weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the increased antibody-dependent inflammation mainly occurs at the time of seroconversion. We identified Fcγ Receptor (FcγR) IIa and FcγRIII as the two primary IgG receptors that are responsible for the induction of key COVID-19-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. In addition, we show that anti-spike IgG-activated human macrophages can subsequently break pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induce microvascular thrombosis in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by anti-spike IgG can be specifically counteracted by fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk kinase.",nal7cc,2021-05-12 11:12:08
"So is the propensity to produce IgG with low fucosylation a property of specific individuals? What about age or other health factors make this more likely?

I would assume that, since we aren't seeing symptoms similiar to severe COVID-19 from vaccinated individuals, that either the produced IgG titers aren't high enough, or that the process by which vaccines promote antibody production isn't prone to produced IgG antibodies with low fucosylation (in the way that viral infection is).",nal7cc,2021-05-12 17:52:23

"Abstract

Misinformation about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pressing societal challenge. Across two studies, one preregistered (n1 = 1771 and n2 = 1777), we assess the efficacy of two ‘prebunking’ interventions aimed at improving people’s ability to spot manipulation techniques commonly used in COVID-19 misinformation across three different languages (English, French and German). We find that Go Viral!, a novel five-minute browser game, (a) increases the perceived manipulativeness of misinformation about COVID-19, (b) improves people’s attitudinal certainty (confidence) in their ability to spot misinformation and (c) reduces self-reported willingness to share misinformation with others. The first two effects remain significant for at least one week after gameplay. We also find that reading real-world infographics from UNESCO improves people’s ability and confidence in spotting COVID-19 misinformation (albeit with descriptively smaller effect sizes than the game).

In the UK, it's the same story. In roughly the same month, B.1.617 has gone from 0.5 prevalence to 10%, implying an absolute increase in case count by something like a factor of 10.

In the US in a month, B.1.617 prevalence has risen from 0.1% to 1%, indicating an absolute rise in cases of nearly ten-fold.    And in every other country it's the same - though outside of India and the UK, the percentage and absolute number of cases remains small.

The caveat here is that each individual country's data is either too small or too irregular to draw firm conclusions from.  The UK has regular sequencing, but extrapolating their prevalence to case counts shows numbers rising from 20 cases per day to 200 - not outside the realm of randomness.

"There are a number of immune response responsible to fight against viral infection.  The key point on focusing antibodies is that classical vaccine platforms and nanoprotein platforms mainly raise B cell mediated immunity as the antigens are not presented by cells. While in DNA(viral vector) and mRNA platforms, the antigens are made and presented by the cells containing these neucleic acids.  Thus, CD8+ T cell plus B cell mediated immunity can be generated.  Focusing on antibody response can let us get a more generalized picture on how antibodies work against mutations.",na1zbb,2021-05-11 23:47:27
"It is considerably more difficult to measure T cell responses e.g. many hospitals cannot do it, only those with affiliated universities and research labs. The assays themselves are also less standardized than antibody tests and more difficult to interpret.

For example, it was reported by the media that the Pfizer vaccine induced strong CD8 T cell responses, after Moderna reported that their vaccine didn't.

[https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-reports-strong-t-cell-response-to-covid-19-vaccine](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-reports-strong-t-cell-response-to-covid-19-vaccine)

But since nobody did a side by side comparison, it could be that the vaccines are actually equivalent, but that Moderna's CD8 assay was too rigorous, insensitive or badly timed, while Pfizer could have spent a lot of time to optimize the assay so that they could report superior results. Who knows?",na1zbb,2021-05-12 03:03:35
"You need a BSL 3 lab to measure T cell response, and quite frankly, testing all elements of the immune response (interluekens, cytokines, call-mediates responses, etc.) is costly and more complex. There are also many confounding factors, like genetic variations, baseline health, autoimmune conditions, etc.",na1zbb,2021-05-12 03:33:22
"Not a biologist by any means, but (I think) the basic two components are that:

1. Antibody mediated immunity is not the be all end all of immunity. When you get vaccinated, your immune system has other mechanisms that protect you as well. Measuring the effectiveness of antibodies is pretty easy to do so there's a lot of lab data on it, but it's just one component of immunity.

2. There isn't a linear relationship between neutralization titers and the effectiveness of antibodies. Within vaccinated individuals, the concentration of antibodies varies substantially (way more than just a factor of 5), but vaccines are still broadly protective despite this variation. To the extent such a relationship exists, it's likely logarithmicish, in which case an 80% drop isn't that big of a deal.",na1zbb,2021-05-11 22:42:48
"The eventual antibody titer available after the drop is the key.  If it stays above the threshold then it still can give significant protection.

Take the Pfizer vaccine against B.1.351 as an example.  [Even though there is a drop by nearly 90%, the titer is still higher than the sera from 4-9 weeks post-recovered patients.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2104974). [There is still 75% vaccine efficacy against the variant](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2104974).",na1zbb,2021-05-11 23:41:03
"The scale for neutralization potency (measured in cell culture) is usually logarithmic. They dilute the serum (from the patient blood) into the cell culture medium, making a series of 2-fold dilutions, and see which is the last dilution that is able to inhibit virus infection. So for example, they may test 10x, 20x, 40x, 80x, 160x, 320x, 640x, 1280x dilutions. If 320x is the biggest dilution that could inhibit virus infection, your neutralising antibody titer is 320. 

If the average vaccinated person has a high antibody titer of say 320 against the wildtype virus, their antibody titer against the virus variant may drop by 80% to 64, but this is still generally effective to prevent infection or at least reduce severity to mild/asymptomatic. Remember that in your actual bloodstream, the serum is full-strength and not diluted. Vaccine efficacy drops when a relatively small fraction of people who generated a low titer antibody response against the wildtype virus actually drop below the threshold of protection. So like those who went from a titer of 20 against wildtype to 4 against variant, and 4 might be too low to have any effect in the respiratory tract.",na1zbb,2021-05-12 02:47:59

From what I read above they tested using people who only got the 1st of 2 vaccines. This means they only were 30-50% protected as they hadn’t yet received the 2nd part of the vaccine.

"The literature went rapidly from ""we do not know what makes certain variants become dominant"" to ""it's all a race of which variant is more transmissive"" without showing strong evidence that it's how it works.

We've seen many variants become dominant before (but with much less media attention) in situations where it did not lead to an increase in overall transmission. And we're working in uncharted territories, who knows how many variants there are for each coronavirus or rhinovirus  that spreads to hundreds of millions on a normal year and how often one new variant emerges and replaces the other ones without causing an epidemic of common colds in the middle of the summer in North America or Europe..",na1zbb,2021-05-12 17:15:59
"The founder effect may be dominant when prevalence is low, and is surely the reason why every small-to-medium-sized country had a different seemingly random lineage take over last summer. It seems unlikely that randomness could determine lineage prevalence in India when they had 10,000 cases a day at the lowest, though.

But there are other huge confounding factors in India, because they are only sequencing a few hundred cases a week (out of 1-3 million total cases).  If the cases sequenced are chosen at random across all 1-3 million, then the confidence interval should be pretty narrow.  But there's no reason (that I know of) to believe they are being chosen at random.  Simply finding a pocket of the ""new variant"" and sequencing a lot around it could directly cause these results.  Screening (either via PCR for a specific mutation or dropout, or for the highest-viral-load samples) can also cause a substantial skew in sampled vs actual lineage prevalence.

The UK data does not have any of these problems, and should be solid.  But of course it has a big problem of its own: the sample size isn't yet big enough to judge by.  Over the last [three 2-week sample intervals](https://covariants.org/per-country) prevalence has risen from 1% to 8% to 9% (still incomplete) there, with a combined n~900 (...compared to n~500 in India).  Another 2-4 weeks there should show whether it continues growing relative to B.1.1.7 or if this is just a blip caused by a lot of imported cases.",na1zbb,2021-05-12 23:21:33

Treatment of severe COVID-19 is currently limited by clinical heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of potentially druggable immune mediators of disease. To advance this, we present a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas in patients with varying COVID-19 severity and compare with influenza, sepsis and healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity revealed cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks as potential therapeutic targets, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Tensor and matrix decomposition of the overall dataset revealed feature groupings linked with disease severity and specificity. Our systems-based integrative approach and blood atlas will inform future drug development, clinical trial design and personalised medicine approaches for COVID-19.",nai2ie,2021-05-12 07:22:57

"This paper needs revisions. The Cell authors themselves cite the PNAS paper ""[Exhaled aerosol increases with COVID-19 infection, age, and obesity](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/8/e2021830118#:~:text=Exhaled%20aerosol%20increases%20with%20COVID,%2C%20age%2C%20and%20obesity%20%7C%20PNAS)"", which shows how

>exhaled aerosol particles vary between subjects by three orders of magnitude, with exhaled respiratory droplet number increasing with degree of COVID-19 infection and elevated BMI-years.

The authors summarize the PNAS research in the body of their paper like so: ""the mechanical and physical factors of a space or donor may strongly contribute to superspreading"" (page 12).

It is disappointing then, that we have evidence some people are exhaling up to a thousand times more particles, and the paper's authors are aware of it, but neither their abstract, introduction, nor conclusion mention that. The relevant part of the conclusion reads:

>Many aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are still unknown and will take years to understand. Among these, the factors that drive superspreading may be the most unclear. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been heterogenous in terms of age, gender, and genetic features. Yet, we know that the vast majority of cases are linked to a small proportion of infected individuals. While transmission of a virus requires that two individuals be within a given space at the same time, other parameters influence the likelihood of getting infected. These may include *donor derived modification of the virion, altered infectivity due to the host microbiome, and/or physical/environmental conditions that play a role in optimizing transmission*.

(Emphasis mine.)",nag8ec,2021-05-12 14:22:50
"Abstract

While significant insights have been gained around pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19, superspreading of coronaviruses remains a mystery. Cluster transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented in many contact tracing studies, where the majority of new SARS-CoV-2 infections are linked to a relatively small portion of infected individuals. Interestingly, the genetic sequence of the virus, severity of disease, and underlying host parameters like age, sex, and health conditions are not correlated with superspreading events. In this commentary, we will discuss what is known and unknown about coronavirus superspreader transmission and explore whether characteristics of the virion, the donor, or the environment contribute to this phenomenon.",nag8ec,2021-05-12 05:19:50
"**Excerpts**  
During the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is marked by cluster transmission phenotypes where 80% of new infections are driven by <20% of infected individuals.

...

Glycosylation of the spike protein could have functional consequences for coronavirus infection. It has been suggested that the coronavirus glycan shield helps to mediate antibody escape [23], consistent with reports for other respiratory viruses [24-27]. Similarly, glycosylation of the spike may also play a role in binding and attachment to host cellular receptors, as seen in a subset of coronaviruses [28]. In addition, glycosylation of viral proteins may influence interactions with specific glycans in the respiratory tract. Recent data has demonstrated that human respiratory mucus from differentiated airway epithelial cells protects enveloped viruses (influenza and bacteriophage, Phi6) from decay in aerosols and droplets [29]. Therefore, it is feasible that glycosylation of the spike protein will enhance interaction with airway components that will influence the stability of the virus in expelled aerosols. Importantly, the efficiency of glycosylation and branching may be host-specific and independent of viral sequence changes. Taken together, the glycosylation profile of the spike protein by different donors may modulate interactions within the airway and thus contribute to coronavirus infectivity and transmissibility.

...

Persistence and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in virus-laden aerosols is critical for long-range transmission in a superspreader event. Aerosol release from from patients with COVID-19 revealed that ~20% of the patients expel signifcantly more aerosols into the environment, and this was found to be related to the body mass index (BMI) of the individual [51], suggesting that an obese donor may contribute to superspreading through the release of more virus-laden aerosols.",nag8ec,2021-05-12 10:22:27
"Yeah, they seem to go completely out of their way to avoid talking about viral load (in infected people's respiratory systems, and then how much they expel), which already varies over a large enough range to explain all the variance they want to explain. All their efforts should be going to explain the wide range in how much virus is coming out of different people's mouths. This likely isn't as mysterious as they keep claiming.",nag8ec,2021-05-12 17:52:45
"Probably because

""exhaled aerosol particles vary between subjects by three orders of magnitude, with exhaled respiratory droplet number **increasing with** degree of COVID-19 infection and **elevated BMI-years**.""  
(from PNAS ref)

and

""underlying host parameters like **age**, sex, and **health conditions** are not correlated with superspreading events""  
(from their paper)

sort of rule out a simple direct correlation.",nag8ec,2021-05-12 18:19:46
">underlying host parameters like age, sex, and health conditions are not correlated with superspreading events

The Cell paper does not substantiate that statement.

Table 1 shows a list of nine SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events. One of those was a teenage summer camp, of which they note ""limitation - may include infections resulting from before or after camp exposure and not based on a single transmission event"". Two more donors were recorded as ""adult"" and ""not disclosed"". The remaining six donor ages are given as 64, 53, 61, \~100, 50, and ""mid-30s"" (let's say 35), for an average of 60. Even if you throw out the two extremes, the average age of donors is 57.

The authors do not present any data about the donors' BMI nor their viral load, but the results of the PNAS paper at a minimum point to these three factors as the most likely causal explanation for super-spreading and they should be a priority for future research.",nag8ec,2021-05-12 20:20:27
"There are some factors that correlate a bit with how much virus folks breathe out, in boring linear ways. But there's *massive* variation on that parameter that isn't explained by these predictors. Current progression of and future severity of disease, on the other hand, are stronger predictors, but don't tell the whole story either -- the random noise term in the model is very large compared to any of the other terms when it comes to the far right tail of the distribution.

There is *absolutely no way* for abnormally high viral load *not* to be the best predictor of superspreading potential. All these other factors might be relevant but must also be teeny because they just don't vary over a large enough range compared to viral load.",nag8ec,2021-05-13 04:42:28

"Abstract

Aims

To explore variables associated with the serological response following COVID‐19 mRNA vaccine.

Methods

Eighty‐six healthcare workers adhering to the vaccination campaign against COVID‐19 were enrolled in January–February 2021. All subjects underwent two COVID‐19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated by 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected before the 1st and 1–4 weeks after the second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, and vaccine side effects were recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters were measured, and body composition was performed through dual‐energy‐X‐ray absorptiometry.

Results

Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = −0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non‐smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titres, independent of BMI, age. and gender.

Conclusions

Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID‐19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS‐CoV‐2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID‐19, it is well‐established that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS‐CoV‐2. Our findings, therefore, call for a vigilant approach, as subjects with central obesity, hypertension, and smoking could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules",na2hhs,2021-05-11 18:31:01

"Abstract

Despite its clinical importance, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains unresolved, hindering dissection of COVID-19 biology. We use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations. We select 44 Sarbecovirus genomes at ideally-suited evolutionary distances, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and a novel alternate-frame gene, ORF3c, whereas ORFs 2b, 3d/3d-2, 3b, 9c, and 10 lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence of protein-coding function. Furthermore, we show no other conserved protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Mutation analysis suggests ORF8 contributes to within-individual fitness but not person-to-person transmission. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures agree, except for fewer-than-expected within-strain mutations in nsp3 and S1, and more-than-expected in nucleocapsid, which shows a cluster of mutations in a predicted B-cell epitope, suggesting immune-avoidance selection. Evolutionary histories of residues disrupted by spike-protein substitutions D614G, N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T provide clues about their biology, and we catalog likely-functional co-inherited mutations. Previously reported RNA-modification sites show no enrichment for conservation. Here we report a high-confidence gene set and evolutionary-history annotations providing valuable resources and insights on SARS-CoV-2 biology, mutations, and evolution.",nai18y,2021-05-12 07:20:31

"RESULTS

  
We report findings in 84 women who received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during pregnancy and 116 women in a control group who did not receive a vaccine (Table 1). Women with vaccination were more likely to deliver vaginally. The first inoculation was 46±24 days before delivery for the 75 patients with known vaccination timing. Vaccinated women showed robust antibody responses, whereas women in the control group were negative (Fig. 1 and Table 1).  
  


DISCUSSION

  
In our cohort of vaccinated pregnant patients, there was no observed increase in the incidence of findings characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and no evidence of vaccine-triggered breakdown in maternal immunologic tolerance of the fetus. Although limited by population differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, these findings add to the growing literature supporting the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy.",nab7qt,2021-05-12 00:48:09

">**Abstract**

>The present global endeavor to uncover the most effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that can tremendously prevent transmission, infection and significantly reduce public health risk. COVID-19 vaccination program is underway in different parts of the world including Bangladesh but till to date there is no available health data revealed among the vaccinated peoples. We conducted a cross-sectional study from February 15 to April 15, 2021 to assess the health status of 1st dose Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinated individuals infected with SARS CoV-2. Standard virological method, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 and the different health parameters from vaccinated individuals were collected through direct mobile phone contact using pre-structured questionnaires. A total of 6146 suspected samples were tested and 1752 were found positive for SARS-CoV-2, of them 200 individuals were identified who received 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Within the test period, majority of male (65.6%) and female (34.4%) carried moderate numbers of viruses which comprise between 30.01-35 cyclic threshold (ct) values. Among the vaccinated individuals, 165 (82.5%; 95% CI: 76.51 - 87.5) persons were not hospitalized and 177 (88.5%; 95% CI: 83.24 - 92.57) did not show any respiratory difficulties. Only a few (16) (8%; 95% CI: 4.64 - 12.67) of COVID-19 positive patients needed extra oxygen support and 199 (99.5%; 95% CI: 97.25 - 99.99) individuals did not require any intensive care unit (ICU) interference. Overall, oxygen saturation was recorded around 96.8% and respiratory difficulties did not extend more than 5 days, irrespective of age and sex during the infection period. Within the vaccinated COVID-19 positive individuals 113 (56.5%; 95% CI: 49.33 - 63.48) and 111(55.5%; 95% CI: 48.32 - 62.51) persons have normal physiological taste and smell. However, we have found a larger proportion of vaccinated persons (129) (64.5%; 95% CI: 57.44 - 71.12) carrying different comorbidity, among them high blood pressure 36 (27.9%; 95% CI, 20.37 - 36.48) and diabetes 32 (24.8%; 95% CI: 17.63 - 33.18) were found more prevalent. Moreover, the significant finding of the present study was 199 (99.5%; 95% CI: 97.25 - 99.99) vaccinated individuals survived with good health conditions and became negative in RT-qPCR. The authors suggest that health risk assessment among the COVID-19 vaccinated persons when infected with SARS-CoV-2 is crucial and time demanding task for the whole world. However, the present study illustrates that the administration of the 1st dose Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine significantly reduces health risk during the COVID-19 infection period.",na50xq,2021-05-11 20:14:32

"PCR tests are a calibrated signalling tool, they're not exactly a measurement tool. The strength of the signal depends on the type and quality of the testing solution and even of the machine, and the threshold depends on the calibration of the machine against the known sample. A sensitive machine with a high quality testing solution requires less cycles to generate a detectable signal. A machine that has been calibrated against a sample with more signalling material than another will set the threshold to match the amount of material in the sample. 

Their experiment definitely needs to be repeated to ensure that all this was controlled for.",na50xq,2021-05-16 13:39:13

">**Abstract**

>Encouraging results have been observed from initial studies evaluating vaccines targeting the novel beta coronavirus which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, concerns have been raised around the efficacy of these vaccines in immunosuppressed populations, including patients with haematological malignancy. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), in particular myelofibrosis (MF), are associated with heterogenous immune defects which are influenced by patient age, disease subtype and the use of cytoreductive therapies. Patients with a WHO defined diagnosis of an MPN presenting to our clinic were recruited following first injection of 30μg BNT162b2. A positive anti-S IgG ELISA was seen in 76.1% (16) of patients following vaccination with positive neutralising antibodies detected in 85.7% (18) of patients. A memory T cell response was observed in 80% (16) of patients, with a CD4+ T cell response in 75% (15) and a CD8+ T cell response in 35% (7). These results, for the first time, provide some reassurance regarding the initial immune response to the BNT162b2 vaccine amongst patients with MPN, with response rates similar to that observed in the general population.",na8bw1,2021-05-11 22:32:21

>The need for SARS-CoV-2 next-generation vaccines has been highlighted by the rise of variants of concern (VoC) and the long-term threat of other coronaviruses. Here, we designed and characterized four categories of engineered nanoparticle immunogens that recapitulate the structural and antigenic properties of prefusion Spike (S), S1 and RBD. These immunogens induced robust S-binding, ACE2-inhibition, and authentic and pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. A Spike-ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine elicited neutralizing titers more than 20-fold higher than convalescent donor serum, following a single immunization, while RBD-Ferritin nanoparticle (RFN) immunogens elicited similar responses after two immunizations. Passive transfer of IgG purified from SpFN- or RFN-immunized mice protected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from a lethal SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge. Furthermore, SpFN- and RFN-immunization elicited ACE2 blocking activity and neutralizing ID50 antibody titers >2,000 against SARS-CoV-1, along with high magnitude neutralizing titers against major VoC. These results provide design strategies for pan-coronavirus vaccine development.",na8k9q,2021-05-11 22:42:30

"**ABSTRACT**
The rapid spread of COVID-19 underscores the need for new treatments. Here we report that cannabidiol (CBD), a compound produced by the cannabis plant, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. CBD and its metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, but not congeneric cannabinoids, potently block SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells. CBD acts after cellular infection, inhibiting viral gene expression and reversing many effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host gene transcription. CBD induces interferon expression and up-regulates its antiviral signaling pathway. A cohort of human patients previously taking CBD had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence of up to an order of magnitude relative to matched pairs or the general population. This study highlights CBD, and its active metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, as potential preventative agents and therapeutic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 at early stages of infection.

Does it mean a substance that affects cannabinoid receptors, or something structurally related to prototypical agonists of cannabinoid receptors? Compare this ambiguity to a phrase like ""substituted amphetamines"", where the meaning is very clear, and does not conflate receptors and their agonists.

"Abstract

Background

COVID-19 patients develop hypolipidemia. However, it is unknown whether lipid levels have improved and there are potential sequlae in recovered patients.

Objective

In this follow-up study, we evaluated serum lipidemia and various physiopathological laboratory values in recovered patients.

Methods

A 3–6 month follow-up study was performed between June 15 and September 3, 2020, to examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59; severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). Sixty-one patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values at admission and follow-up.

Results

LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p <  0.05). LDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p <  0.05). Coagulation and liver functional values were significantly improved at follow-up than at admission for patients (p <  0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p <  0.001) during patients’ recovery. With exclusion of the subjects taking traditional Chinese medicines or cholesterol-lowering drugs, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly increased at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p <  0.05). Residue lesions were observed in CT images in 72% (44 of 61) of follow-up patients.

Conclusions

Improvements of LDL-c, HDL-c, liver functions, and incomplete resolution of lung lesions were observed at 3–6 month follow-up for recovered patients, indicating that a long-term recovery process could be required and the development of sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis could be expected in some patients.",na2t4r,2021-05-11 18:43:45

"Abstract

Objective 
This study aimed to determine the association of hyperlipidemia with clinical endpoints among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially those with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes. 

Methods 
This multicenter retrospective cohort study included all patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 from 21 hospitals in Hubei province, China between December 31, 2019 and April 21, 2020. Patients who were aged < 18 or ≥ 85 years old, in pregnancy, with acute lethal organ injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, severe acute pancreatitis, acute stroke), hypothyroidism, malignant diseases, severe malnutrition, and those with normal lipid profile under lipid-lowering medicines (e.g., statin, niacin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and ezetimibe) were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at 1:1 ratio was performed to minimize baseline differences between patient groups of hyperlipidemia and non-hyperlipidemia. PSM analyses with the same strategies were further conducted for the parameters of hyperlipidemia in patients with increased triglyceride (TG), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Mixed-effect Cox model analysis was performed to investigate the associations of the 28-days all-cause deaths of COVID-19 patients with hyperlipidemia and the abnormalities of lipid parameters. The results were verified in male, female patients, and in patients with pre-existing CVDs and type 2 diabetes. 

Results 
Of 10 945 inpatients confirmed as COVID-19, there were 9822 inpatients included in the study, comprising 3513 (35.8%) cases without hyperlipidemia and 6309 (64.2%) cases with hyperlipidemia. Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after PSM at 1:1 ratio, hyperlipidemia was not associated with increased or decreased 28-day all-cause death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17 (95% CI, 0.95-1.44), P =0.151]. We found that the parameters of hyperlipidemia were not associated with the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality [adjusted HR, 1.23 (95% CI, 0.98-1.55), P = 0.075 in TG increase group; 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07), P = 0.123 in LDL-C increase group; and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.9-1.39), P = 0.299 in HDL-C decrease group, respectively]. Hyperlipidemia was also not significantly associated with the increased mortality of COVID-19 in patients accompanied with CVDs or type 2 diabetes, and in both male and female cohorts. 

Conclusion 
Our study support that the imbalanced lipid profile is not significantly associated with the 28-day all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients, even in those accompanied with CVDs or diabetes. Similar results were also obtained in subgroup analyses of abnormal lipid parameters. Therefore, hyperlipidemia might be not a major causative factor for poor outcome of COVID-19, which provides guidance for the intervention of inpatients during the epidemic of COVID-19.",na2vdv,2021-05-11 18:47:02

"Abstract

On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a status of global pandemic caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). The pandemic is currently underway, and to date has caused approximately 2.42 million deaths worldwide. The first vaccines have recently been licensed; however, research continues to identify therapeutic agents to prevent serious complications, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticoagulant or antiviral agents authorized for other therapeutic indications. Epidemiological evidence shows that advanced age and comorbidities, such as diabetes, heart disease, and dyslipidemia may represent COVID-19 risk factors. In particular, in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins, it is recommended that treatment should not be discontinued if COVID-19 infection occurs. The pleiotropic effects of statins are well known. In this brief review, we propose that the use of statins can potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced tissue damage and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients through several pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects of statins that may be a significant benefit in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins and COVID-19 positive. Recent evidence shows promising results.",na2qlk,2021-05-11 18:40:55

"Summary

Background

The prevalence and prognostic implications of pre-existing dyslipidaemia in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear.

Aim

To assess the prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing dyslipidaemia.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to 31 January 2021, reporting data on dyslipidaemia among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was calculated using a random-effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel–Haenszel random-effect models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic.

Results

Of about 18 studies, enrolling 74 132 COVID-19 patients (mean age 70.6 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 17.5% of cases (95% CI: 12.3–24.3%, P < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 98.7%). Pre-existing dyslipidaemia was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term death (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.19–2.41, P = 0.003), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 88.7%). Due to publication bias, according to the Trim-and-Fill method, the corrected random-effect ORs resulted 1.61, 95% CI 1.13–2.28, P < 0.0001 (one studies trimmed).

Conclusion

Dyslipidaemia represents a major comorbidity in about 18% of COVID-19 patients but it is associated with a 60% increase of short-term mortality risk.",na2nyt,2021-05-11 18:38:16

"> Compared with previous studies, we found lower absolute risks for most severe post-acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies on serious complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as myocarditis, reduced lung function, venous thromboembolism, encephalitis, stroke, and paediatric inflammatory multisystemic syndrome were usually done in individuals admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 without control groups, or by screening individuals with these conditions for SARS-CoV-2 infection or vice versa, conferring a high risk of selection and surveillance bias. Furthermore, we did not identify any events of myocarditis, cerebral haemorrhage, encephalitis, or diagnoses related to paediatric inflammatory multisystemic syndrome in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission, indicating that these complications might be exceedingly rare in these SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did find an increased risk of post-acute venous thromboembolism (adjusted RR 1·77), and the fact that the risk estimates were attenuated (adjusted RR 1·33) when excluding individuals admitted to hospital for COVID-19 during week 3 and 4 after the SARS-CoV-2 test suggests that venous thromboembolism events might occur with a delay in some patients with COVID-19. In support of this hypothesis, we also found an increased risk of receiving a hospital diagnosis of other venous embolism and thrombosis (appendix pp 21–23) when comparing individuals with SARS-COV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals.

> Persistence of symptoms such as fatigue, cough, dyspnoea, anosmia, headache, and joint pain have been well described after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in hospitalised,  and non-hospitalised individuals. In our study, we identified an increased risk beyond 2 weeks of receiving a hospital diagnosis of dyspnoea (adjusted RR 2·00), but no increased risk of hospital visits for other symptom-related diagnoses, compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. The increased risk of initiating short-acting β-2 agonists might be related to dyspnoea, as might be the increased number of general practitioner and outpatient hospital clinic visits after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission. Information on the reason for these visits was not available. We could assume that excess general practitioner and outpatient visits were due to persisting symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection not leading to initiation of specific drugs or acute treatment. A large, international patient-initiated survey done in individuals who had persisting symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection reported a high prevalence of fatigue, dyspnoea, and cognitive issues at any point from the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection and up to 7 months after. Our analysis only captures specific symptoms leading to hospital contacts, and can therefore not be used as a measure of the overall prevalence of these symptoms. It is expected that absolute risks of persisting symptoms such as dyspnoea or fatigue would be vastly underestimated, because only a fraction of individuals with these symptoms will be seen at a hospital. Still, the discrepancy between patient-reported symptoms and quantification of health-care encounters is important knowledge, because it might indicate that a presumably large share of",n9r9tp,2021-05-11 08:26:07
"I’m just a well-read layman but have read enough stories from longhaulers to believe that long Covid is a very real and terrible outcome for many people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Yet I have to admit that this study provides an important contrary perspective, and seems to be well designed. I also appreciate how the authors did not try to extend its findings beyond just the rate at which medications were obtained by people in each group.

It’s definitely worth considering when trying to gauge the extent of long-term symptoms from this virus. I wonder if one limitation of the study is the widespread dismissal by many doctors of their patients’ long Covid complaints, which may have caused them to be less inclined to prescribe medications.

"Abstract

The repeated spillovers of β-coronaviruses in humans along with the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 escape variants highlight the need to develop broad coronavirus therapeutics and vaccines. Five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated from COVID-19 convalescent individuals and found to cross-react with multiple β-coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins by targeting the stem helix. One of these mAbs, S2P6, cross-reacts with more than twenty human and animal β-coronavirus S glycoproteins and broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped viruses from the sarbecovirus, merbecovirus and embecovirus subgenera. Structural and functional studies delineate the molecular basis of S2P6 cross-reactivity and broad neutralization and indicate that this mAb blocks viral entry through inhibition of membrane fusion. S2P6 protects hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (including the B.1.351 variant of concern) through viral neutralization and Fc-mediated effector functions. Serological and B cell repertoire analyses indicate that antibodies targeting the stem helix are found in some convalescent donors and vaccinees but are predominantly of narrow specificity. Germline reversion of the identified cross-reactive mAbs revealed that their unmutated ancestors are specific for the endemic OC43 or HKU1 viruses and acquired enhanced affinity and breadth through somatic mutations. These data demonstrate that conserved epitopes in the coronavirus fusion machinery can be targeted by protective antibodies and provide a framework for structure-guided design of pan-β-coronavirus vaccines eliciting broad protection.",n9pt0q,2021-05-11 06:35:19

"**Abstract**  
*Objective*: This report is a case series of consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated with a nutritional and oxidative medical approach. We describe the treatment program and report the response of the 107 COVID-19 patients.

*Study Design*: Observational case series consecutive.  
*Setting*: A family practice office in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.  
*Patients*: All patients seen in the office from February through May 2020 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. COVID-19 was either diagnosed via PCR or antibody  
testing as well as those not tested diagnosed via symptomology.

*Interventions*: Oral Vitamins A, C, D, and iodine were given to 107 subjects (99%). Intravenous solutions of hydrogen peroxide and Vitamin C were given to 32 (30%) and 37 (35%) subjects. Thirty-seven (35%) of the cohort was treated with intramuscular ozone. A dilute, nebulized hydrogen peroxide/ saline mixture, with Lugol’s iodine, was used by 91 (85%).  
Main Outcome Measures: History and physical exam were reviewed for COVID-19 symptoms including cough, fever, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal complaints. Laboratory reports were examined for SARS-CoV-2 results. Symptomatic improvement after treatment was reported for each patient consisting of first improvement, mostly better, and completely better.

*Results*: There were a total of 107 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Thirty-four were tested for SARS-CoV-2(32%) and twenty-seven (25%) tested positive. Three were hospitalized (3%) with two of the three hospitalized before instituting treatment and only one requiring hospitalization after beginning treatment. There were no deaths. The most common symptoms in the cohort were fever (81%), shortness of breath (68%), URI which included cough (69%), and gastrointestinal distress symptoms (27%). For the entire cohort, first improvement was noted in 2.4 days. The cohort reported symptoms mostly better after 4.4 days and completely better 6.9 days after starting the program. For the SARS-CoV-2 test positive patients, fever was present in 25 (93%), shortness of breath in 20 (74%) and upper respiratory symptoms including cough in 21 (78%) while gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 9 (33%). The time to improvement in the SARS-CoV-2 test positive group was slightly longer than the entire cohort.

*Conclusion*: At present, there is no published cure, treatment, or preventive for COVID-19 except for a recent report on dexamethasone for seriously ill patients. **A novel treatment program combining nutritional and oxidative therapies was shown to successfully treat the signs and symptoms of 100% of 107 patients diagnosed with COVID-19.**  
Each patient was treated with an individualized plan consisting of a combination of oral, IV, IM, and nebulized nutritional and oxidative therapies which resulted in zero deaths and recovery from COVID-19.",n9zha0,2021-05-11 16:21:42

">The human genome bears evidence of extensive invasion by retroviruses and other retroelements, as well as by diverse RNA and DNA viruses. High frequency of somatic integration of the RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the DNA of infected cells was recently suggested, based on a number of observations. One key observation was the presence of chimeric RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from human host DNA. Here, we examined the possible origin specifically of human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads in RNA-seq libraries and provide alternative explanations for their origin. Chimeric reads were frequently detected also between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from mitochondrial DNA or episomal adenoviral DNA present in transfected cell lines, which was unlikely the result of SARS-CoV-2 integration. Furthermore, chimeric reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from nuclear DNA was highly enriched for host exonic, rather than intronic or intergenic sequences and often involved the same, highly expressed host genes. Although these findings do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 somatic integration, they nevertheless suggest that human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads found in RNA-seq data may arise during library preparation and do not necessarily signify SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription, integration in to host DNA and further transcription.",n9j7c6,2021-05-11 00:26:56

It’s as if I hit a golf ball and shot a picture of the golf ball next to the moon and then said that I’d shown that it’s possible to hit a golf ball into orbit with a driver.  And then my further evidence was to load a golf ball onto an Atlas V rocket and launch it into orbit and then claim that’s the proof.

1. Get antibodies from vaccinated people
2. Figure out the common antibody binding locations on the spike protein
3. Generate mutated versions of the spike protein with mutations in the antibody binding locations. Include spike proteins with multiple mutations.
4. Screen for whether the mutant spike protein is feasible (such as testing its binding to ACE2 receptors
5. Test whether antibodies can still bind to the mutant spike protein deemed feasible
6. Make mRNAs for variant spike proteins from step 5 that have significant resistance to antibody binding

"Hello, 

First of all, I want to make clear that I absolutely am not a conspiracy theorist or an anti vaxxer or the like. I have no medical knowledge whatsoever so this is just me trying to understand. 

I’ve heard a lot about vaccine shedding in the past couple of weeks from multiple mostly unreliable sources however I came across this Pfizer document. In section 8.3.5 it is stated that:

8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy
An EDP occurs if:

• A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention.

• A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.

• A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy:

• A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.
 
• A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.

Does this mean I can get „exposed to the vaccine“ just from being around somebody who has been vaccinated? If yes, how would that be possible?

Assuming those index cases were telling the truth, the data would support the idea that pre-symptomatic transmission is common. People also (hopefully) self isolate after they develop symptoms and the number of people they infect afterwards is not always indicative of their contagiousness. 

The latest contact tracing study is https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/6/21-0465_article , a person sang in church in Australia on July 15, 16, and 17. This person developed symptoms (headache and malaise) on July 16 and more symptoms (fever and cough) on July 17. He appeared to infected 5 people on July 15 while he was pre-symptomatic, infected 7 people on July 16, and possibly no one on July 17, despite him singing two services that day (he did one service on both 15 and 16).

"> Generate mutated versions of the spike protein with mutations in the antibody binding locations. Include spike proteins with multiple mutations.
> Screen for whether the mutant spike protein is feasible (such as testing its binding to ACE2 receptors

This is what passage experiments do all in one step - by serially infecting human cell lines with the virus, it can be predicted which mutations are successful in vitro. And then yes, separately experiments have been done to look across the entire viral genome as to how potential non-synonymous mutations affect binding. If you're interested I'll look up a couple of these studies later (they were done many months ago and it can be hard to find them by keyword among the thousands of COVID-19 genomic studies).

However the real world is messier than these types of in vitro experiments and things that ""work"" in lab cells sometimes don't correlate to increased transmission. Ultimately the mutations you may have heard about like L452R or E484K could be shown to arise and be successful in lab cells but so did a lot of others that haven't gotten any sort of foothold. Those became mutations found in ""variants of concern"" only after they started to arise more and more often in samples sequenced from patients.

There is ultimately a more robust way to get ahead of antigenic drift. We can look at the 'highly conserved' antibody epitopes that are *not* knocked out by potential variations and focus the vaccine response on generating mostly those.

"> Is there a credible suspicion that it may result from the immune response, e.g. against the spike protein? 

Yes the immune response, no not the immune response to virus proteins. One common immune signature found in people who have had COVID-19 is something called a ""double negative B-cell"". These are B-cells that have undergone class switching (they have been activated) but lack expression of IgD (an antibody that basically says ""please program me"") or CD27 (a marker of B- and T-cell memory). These cells are implicated in lupus.

COVID19 In the US, trailing twelve month death toll sits at 498,816 as of today. In January, deaths per million per week were 71, 10x higher than a bad year of the flu. As of this week, the 2017-2018 flu season was claiming 3.2 lives per million, whereas COVID19 claimed 13.0 - more than 4x worse.

(All sources, cdc data). 

Keep in mind, COVID has had this higher death count even with NPIs like mask wearing, etc. Influenza was at its lowest death count in more than a decade, yet COVID still hit 71 deaths per million per week at its peak.

As vaccinations have increased, especially among 65+, which account for 80% of deaths, Case Fatality Rates (CFR) have declined from a 21-day lagged CFR of 1.7% to 1.0 for the past 14 days.

"The example that's usually given for this argument is a vaccine given to factory-raised chickens to prevent Marek's Disease. The vaccine is very ""leaky"" - it does not block transmission. The virus over time has adapted, and mutations to allow it to spread more effectively between vaccinated chickens have made it fatal to unvaccinated chickens.

The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are not particularly leaky, and given that other human coronaviruses spread endemically against the backdrop of 70% seropositivity in the population without evolving this way It's not likely an issue anyway. These are different types of viruses; coronaviruses basically just need to evade mucosal IgA to keep themselves endemic. The virus that causes Marek's is a herpes virus so pre-vaccine it would act like herpes in humans and take up residence in the central nervous system for life, spreading to new hosts during a flareup; the vaccine-evading version causes lymphoma and death rather than being effectively transmissible (unless the host is vaccinated). This evolution was a tradeoff that SARS-CoV-2 wouldn't have to make.

Now if the argument is that vaccination forces the virus to evolve towards antibody evasion... well duh. But so does infection, and infection gives the virus far more warm bodies to find that mutation in.

Pfizer also reported the same thing in their US trial that was done before any measurably different strain had been detected, though.  Heterogeneity means that people who have had COVID before are a *lot* more likely to be exposed to it than those who haven't.  It's impossible to control for this to get an accurate efficacy without challenge trials.

The paper you linked is an estimate, not a study, and it stated it assumed that people who never develop symptoms are 75% as infectious as people who do develop symptoms. This assumption does not line up well with the studies we do have that actually did contact tracing and looked at the level to which asymptomatic people infected others. 

For example, this study https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/ looked at 3410 close contacts and reported asymptomatic cases only infected 0.3% of their close contacts. ""The secondary attack rate increased with the severity of index cases, from 0.3% (CI, 0.0 to 1.0%) for asymptomatic to 3.3% (CI, 1.8% to 4.8%) for mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% to 6.8%) for moderate, and 6.2% (CI, 3.2% to 9.1%) for severe or critical cases.""

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102 is a meta-analysis of household transmission, it reported that asymptomatic case infected about 0.7% of their household members, compared to 17% for symptomatic cases.",n97sx8,2021-05-13 01:28:20

"**Abstract**

The B.1.617 variant emerged in the Indian state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India and to at least 40 countries. There have been fears that two key mutations seen in the receptor binding domain L452R and E484Q would have additive effects on evasion of neutralising antibodies. Here we delineate the phylogenetics of B.1.617 and spike mutation frequencies, in the context of others bearing L452R. The defining mutations in B.1.617.1 spike are L452R and E484Q in the RBD that interacts with ACE2 and is the target of neutralising antibodies. All B.1.617 viruses have the P681R mutation in the polybasic cleavage site region in spike. We report that B.1.617.1 spike bearing L452R, E484Q and P681R mediates entry into cells with slightly reduced efficiency compared to Wuhan-1. This spike confers modestly reduced sensitivity to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies that is similar in magnitude to the loss of sensitivity conferred by L452R or E484Q alone. Furthermore we show that the P681R mutation significantly augments syncytium formation upon the B.1.617.1 spike protein, potentially contributing to increased pathogenesis observed in hamsters and infection growth rates observed in humans.",n93wim,2021-05-10 14:34:23

"SUMMARY

>Despite mounting evidence for SARS-CoV-2 engagement with immune cells, most express little, if any, of the canonical receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2. Here, using a myeloid-cell receptor-focused ectopic expression screen, we identified several C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, LSECtin, ASGR1, and CLEC10A) and Tweety family member 2 (TTYH2) as glycan-dependent binding partners of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Except for TTYH2, these molecules primarily interacted with spike via regions outside of the receptor-binding domain. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of pulmonary cells from COVID-19 patients indicated predominant expression of these molecules on myeloid cells. Although these receptors do not support active replication of SARS-CoV-2, their engagement with virus induced robust proinflammatory responses in myeloid cells that correlated with COVID-19 severity. We also generated a bispecific anti-spike nanobody that not only blocked ACE2-mediated infection but also the myeloid receptors-mediated proinflammatory responses. **Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2-myeloid receptor interactions promote immune hyper-activation, which represents potential targets for COVID-19 therapy**.

"Abstract

Background Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are still urgently needed as only 5% of the global population has been vaccinated. Here we report the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine (INO-4800) targeting the full-length Spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 when given to adults at high-risk of exposure.

Methods INO-4800 was evaluated in 401 participants randomized at a 3:3:1:1 ratio to receive either INO-4800 (1 mg or 2 mg dose) or placebo (1 or 2 injections) intradermally (ID) followed by electroporation (EP) using CELLECTRA® 2000 at Days 0 and 28. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04642638

Findings The majority of adverse events (AEs) were of Grade 1 and 2 in severity and did not appear to increase in frequency with the second dose. The number of participants experiencing each of the most common AEs did not differ appreciably between the two dosing groups. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of binding and neutralizing antibody levels were statistically significantly greater in the 2.0 mg dose group versus the 1.0 mg dose group. The T cell immune responses measured by the ELISpot assay were also higher in the 2.0 mg dose group compared to the 1.0 mg dose group.

Interpretation INO-4800 at both the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses when administered in a 2-dose regimen appeared to be safe and well-tolerated in all adult ages. However, the comparative immunogenicity analysis favored selection of INO-4800 2.0 mg dose for advancement into a Phase 3 efficacy evaluation.",n97c1o,2021-05-10 16:18:35

"> **Abstract**

>The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness is not known. Using data from a prospective cohort of index cases and high-risk contact, we reconstructed by modelling the viral load at the time of contact and the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was particularly large in household contacts, with a transmission probability that increased to as much as 37% when the viral load was greater than 10 log 10 copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset in most individuals, with a median probability of transmission of 15%, that hindered large individual variations (IQR: [8, 37]). The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by 2 to 4-fold on average, we estimate that infection with B1.1.7 virus could lead to an increase in the probability of transmission by 8 to 17%.",n8nk5n,2021-05-09 22:05:08

">Over one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several excellent vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies. Here we report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines. In the absence of vaccination antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response, and as expected, **results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern that are comparable to or greater than neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 achieved by vaccination of naive individuals.** The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover, and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in variants of concern. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand dramatically after vaccination. **The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.** Should memory responses evolve in a similar manner in vaccinated individuals, additional appropriately timed boosting with available vaccines could cover most circulating variants of concern.",n8xnkq,2021-05-10 14:12:43

">**Abstract**


>A comprehensive analysis and characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 infection model that mimics non-severe and severe COVID-19 in humans is warranted for understating the virus and developing preventive and therapeutic agents. Here, we characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse model expressing human (h)ACE2 in mice, controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter, in epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where SARS-CoV-2 infections typically start. **We found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2x103 and 2x104 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lungs, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2x101 and 2x102 PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection.** In this humanized hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered after infection with a low dose of virus also survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and non-severe COVID-19 in humans and can provide insight into disease progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19.",n93x7l,2021-05-10 20:56:28

We are aware of only this one case so the evidence might have limited generalizability, but occurred despite his neutralizing antibody titer being much higher than that of other patients evaluated at our facility, suggesting immune responses other than the humoral immune response may have an important role in viral clearance. This may explain some vaccine failures if vaccine-induced antibody alone is insufficient to eliminate viral infections in some people. For persistent viral infections, perhaps cellular immune responses and innate immune function play a vital role in eventual clearance.

In this case, it sound like they simply looked at the accumulated mutations in the recovered RNA, which is a decent proxy for checking for continuous viral infection. Not perfect, but as they say the likely explanation is ongoing infection and this warrants further study. (I didn't read the full paper, though).

>Although previous studies suggest repositive COVID-19 patients have lower or no infectiousness, our evidence suggests infectiousness may last until 151 days after symptom onset. Although lack of lab facilities prevented virus isolation and culture was not performed, the observed accumulated mutations as well as positive sgRNA 3–4 months after infection suggests on-going viral replication in the course of infection and therefore potential for transmission. More attention to the infectiousness of repositive patients is therefore warranted.",n8bea8,2021-05-09 17:16:07

"Abstract

To successfully protect against pathogen infection, a vaccine must elicit efficient adaptive immunity, including B and T cell responses. While B cell responses are key, as they can mediate antibody-dependent protection, T cells can modulate B cell activity and directly contribute to the elimination of pathogen-infected cells. In the unprecedented race to develop an effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the respiratory disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have emerged as front runners thanks to their capacity for rapid development and ability to drive potent adaptive immune responses. In this review article, we provide an overview of the results from pre-clinical studies in animal models as well as clinical studies in humans that assessed the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, with a primary focus on adaptive immune responses post vaccination",n8ji7m,2021-05-09 18:54:39

"statins have a anti inflammatory effect on the coronary arteries, no suprises here.",n7utc2,2021-05-09 02:45:45
"The severe respiratory illness due to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is triggered by an intense pro-inflammatory host response. Statins, prescribed primarily for lipid reduction, are known to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and have been associated with a reduced mortality rate among COVID-19 patients taking statins as reported in two recent retrospective studies. However, a meta-analysis that included nine studies showed that statin use did not improve in-hospital outcomes of those with COVID-19. In addition, concerns regarding the use of statins and an increase in COVID-19 infections have been raised, as statins may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our goal was to investigate the effect of statins in COVID-19 patients in a large, diverse patient population across the United States containing nearly 120,000 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We used propensity score matching of demographics, comorbidities, and medication indication to compare statin-treated patients (N = 2,297) with matched controls (N = 4,594). We observed a small, but statistically significant, decrease in mortality among patients prescribed statins (16.1%) when compared with matched COVID-19-positive controls (18.0 to 20.6%). These results support previous evidence that statins do not increase COVID-19-related mortality and may, in fact, have a mitigating effect on severity of the disease reflected in a slight reduction in mortality. Mixed findings on effects of statins in COVID-19 patients reported in the literature should prompt prospective randomized controlled trials in order to define better who might be advantaged with respect to clinical outcomes.",n7utc2,2021-05-08 19:04:17

This is wild speculation. Full scale recombination doesn't really happen with this virus because it has a proofreading enzyme that checks the genome. It's not like influenza which whole scale swaps out genes in hosts infected with multiple strains.

Coronaviruses are huge molecules. Way bigger than influenza; swapping genes would be way more detrimental. And certainly not with another type of virus altogether...

Here's a paper about this enzyme in coronaviruses generally:

That's not what I mean at all. It's also wrong. Every RNA strand is going to be a different length, depending on how many nucleotide pairs if contains.

My point about the size of the virus is that there are far more nucleotide pairs and a far larger diversity of genes (the SARS-CoV-2 protein is *massive* compared with e.g. influenza).

Given the sheer size of the virus, wholesale swaps of the genome are potentially more detrimental. Small swaps obviously happen, but importantly they're small: the immune response developed from prior infection or inoculation will continue to work against those small swaps for some time. In order for a fully (or even mostly fully) antibody evasive variant to emerge, it would take much, much longer than a year based on everything we understand about coronaviruses",n8228h,2021-05-09 15:30:25

A new Universal rule for Covid 19 data is derived in this paper using the SIR model.

It relates infection and removal rates and is validated by the global Covid 19 data. Over 186,000 data points, from 190 countries and the states of the US, for the period April 1 to December 12, 2020 - fall on a single line, as the Universal rule predicts, transcending geography, ethnicity and race.

The Universal rule requires that Herd immunity begin when just 25% of the population is vaccinated. With the anticipated 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of the Biden administration, Herd immunity may be imminent in the US.

The Universal rule promotes a temporary stasis with continuing infections and hospitalizations and becomes a barrier to runaway infections, making it practically impossible to reach Herd immunity, as Sweden discovered. Reduced infected population seems to be a third option to stifle the epidemic - a little known accomplishment, first by North Dakota and subsequently by twelve other U.S. states, including South Dakota.",n88iks,2021-05-09 08:16:05

"**Excerpts**  

With mass vaccinations beginning around the world, there is an expectation for an alternate and more legitimate path to real Herd immunity soon. But the estimates of when that will happen are wildly different, ranging from 60% to over 80% of total population being vaccinated. Worse, the estimates are provided in the spirit of the Delphic oracle, without any explanation and attribution.

..

This section includes three mathematical results that are crucial to the paper. The first is the derivation of an exact solution to the 94-year-old SIR model.  Next, the exact solution is used to reveal a hidden Universal rule, applicable to global Covid 19 data. The third is to derive the mathematical restrictions on the development of the epidemic placed by the Universal rule. While the derivations of these results are complete and mathematically rigorous, they are quite unnecessary to understand the validation and implication of the results. Once the results are accepted, they shed light on the failed experience in Sweden, the little-known success in controlling the epidemic in North and South Dakota and several other states, and how the 100 million vaccinations in the first hundred days is an implicit guarantee of Herd immunity for the entire nation.

..

The conclusion is that, if the SIR model is a valid description of the Covid 19 pandemic, then the Universal rule must apply for the entire set of global Covid 19 data. It is a very restrictive rule. The datapoints 𝛽/𝛾, I and R for any country or state, and for any date, must all fall on the same line with slope and Y intercept, both equal to 1. If the data fail to match the rule, and bereft of an adequate explanation, it is time to consider a different model.

..

Until this point, all of this is just theory – based on mathematics. In this section we will validate the Universal rule, using available data, to graphically prove the linear relationship between 𝛽/𝛾 and 𝐼/𝑅 as in eq.(10). This analysis includes the data published by the Johns Hopkins University(19), for the period April 1 to December 12,2020, for all the states in the US (as well as data from Puerto Rico and DC) and 190 countries of the world. The plot is of 𝛽/𝛾 (on Y axis) and 𝐼/𝑅 (on X axis). There is a total of over 186,000 data points. Remarkably, as the theory predicts, all the data fall on one line with slope 1 and Y intercept equal to 1. (These line graphs are of a time series obtained using Tableau.)

..

For those who study or use models, simple and solvable are the watchwords. There is no advantage in representing a complex system with a complex model, nor is there in replacing one unsolvable system with another. An important requirement for a model is that it be self-consistent.  

It took a model like SIR to identify some of the important thresholds in an epidemic evident (22, 23). Weiss (24) explains why both the threshold for infection and the herd immunity threshold are difficult to deduce from data.

..

Numerical solutions can be a trap: But models are not a panacea either. In the case of the Covid 19 SIR model, the equations of the model are nonlinear and the solutions are approximate. Hirsch et al.(11) and Strogatz (12) point out the familiar mathematical traps related to numerical solutions to nonlinear equations. The Universal rule discovered here, for example, would most likely remain hidden, if only numerical solutions were available. Exact solutions in the form of analytic functions makes analysis possible, and that helped reveal the Universal rule.

..

There are three distinct ways to stop the epidemic.  

(i) Lower infections to control the epidemic: Social distancing, mask wearing, quarantining and contact tracing are all known methods to reduce infection. Many states took these suggestions seriously while others did not. Absent quantitative measurements it is difficult to argue for or against them. Coincidentally, Atul Gawande in an article in the New Yorker (29) called North Dakota the “worst hit state in the worst hit country in the world”. Our analysis shows that North Dakota is also the best state in curbing infections and reversing the epidemic in the nation. It is difficult to make any generalizations, since the states that have done well in keeping infected populations low are those that are not fans of CDC guidelines or mask mandates. We have absolutely no explanation as to why, for example, South Dakota, that hosted a 500,000 strong motor cycle rally at Sturgis, and openly flouted best practices of mask wearing and social distancing, found its infected population decreasing substantially and reversing the epidemic by January 2021. It seems as if Covid 19 defies simple categorization.

(ii) Promote runaway infections, as in Sweden: As we found, that was not successful and the entire program was considered a failure at many levels. But as before, Covid 19 fights stereotyping. A counter example of sorts, is the case of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, with 2670 total passengers and 712 in the Removed category, they reached Herd immunity with 𝑆/𝑅 ln(𝑁/𝑆)= 0.85293. This was a case of runaway infections leading to Herd immunity – as Sweden hoped. So,it seems to work, but not in all cases. Speculating for a moment, it could be that in the narrow confines of a cruise ship, the rate of spread was very fast and very quickly the condition 𝑅>𝑁/4 (that is used for vaccination programs) was met and so it was not subject to the condition 𝑆 < 𝑆2 (with 𝑅 ≤ 𝑁/4) to reach Herd immunity.

(iii) Herd immunity through vaccinations: The Universal rule imposes a mathematical restriction that Herd immunity begins around the time when 25% of the total population has been vaccinated. This is a mathematical conclusion that is startlingly different from the current consensus that 70% and more must be vaccinated to trigger Herd immunity. This also means that President Biden’s promise of 100 million people vaccinated in the first 100 days is actually a path to imminent Herd immunity in many states of the nation.

..

Will onset of Herd immunity lead to the end of the pandemic? Probably not. Even though the pandemic is abating, it has not been eradicated. The residual infected populations can continue to infect, albeit at a lower rate. Continued mass vaccinations can off-set this reemergence of the epidemic and restore Herd immunity.

..

As more get infected, the Universal rule reveals a negative feedback effect against runaway infections, slowing down the spread, making it mathematically improbable to develop herd immunity through mass infections, as Sweden learned recently.  But the inadvertent success on the Diamond Princess and Dharavi makes us pause before dismissing the runaway infections as a feasible path to Herd immunity.",n88iks,2021-05-09 07:42:53

Dear Sir,

Blood groups might influence susceptibility to COVID‐19 [1-7]. We investigated associations between blood groups and COVID‐19 infection in UK Biobank participants, a prospective population‐based study that, between 2006 and 2010, enrolled 502,620 people aged 38–73 years in the United Kingdom. All participants gave written informed consent for their data to be used for research purposes, which was also approved by an ethics committee.

Six blood group genotypes (AA, AB, AO, BB, BO and OO) provided four phenotypes (A, B, AB and O) [2]. Blood groups O (43.4%; n = 211 412) and A (43.4%; AA genotype: n = 36 332; AO genotype: n = 175 173) were similarly common, blood groups B (9.6%; BB genotype: n = 2789; BO genotype: n = 44 049) and AB (3.6%; n = 17 610) less so. Blood group was not available for 15,520 (3.0%) participants. By the 24th of August 2020, of 18 221 participants (3.6%) tested for COVID‐19, 1713 (0.3% of all participants) had at least one positive test, of whom 623 (36.4%) were hospitalized and 318 (18.6%) died. Of those who tested negative, 4,623 were hospitalized (28.0%) and 597 (3.6%) died. Blood group was known for all but 635 (3.5%) of those tested. Amongst those tested for COVID‐19, median age (70 years at the time of infection) and the proportions who were men (48%) were similar amongst blood groups but those with blood group B were less likely to be white (82.7%) compared with other blood groups (89.3% for O, 91.6% for A and 85.2% for AB). Participants had similar level of higher education (college or university) for all blood groups (28%).

The percentage of participants tested was similar amongst blood groups as was the rate of positive tests for COVID‐19 (Table 1). However, participants with blood group O were less likely to be hospitalized with COVID‐19 after a positive test (33.3% versus 38.0%). Amongst those who tested negative for COVID‐19, the rate of subsequent hospitalization was similar amongst blood groups (data not shown).

a Compared with O/OO, other blood group (either genotype or phenotype) was not significantly associated with both cases using the multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, education and ethnicity groups.

In contrast to our results, others have found that people with blood group O have lower rates for a positive COVID‐19 test but that the risk of developing severe symptoms requiring hospitalization after a positive test is similar amongst blood groups [3-5]. The reasons for these observed associations and the disparities amongst reports remain speculative [6, 7] but could reflect the play of chance, differences in case ascertainment or variations in the prevalence of blood groups according to ethnicity. We did not have information on Rhesus factor or other blood groups. To date, too few deaths have occurred to conduct reliable analyses for mortality. Our findings should be added to the accumulating evidence on the relationship between blood group and COVID‐19.",n7u95o,2021-05-08 18:37:59

"Well, the Colombian trial trended for 60 percent reduction in escalation of care for example. The Iranian study doesn't conflict at all with that!

"How does it conflict with that trial? Are you familiar with the concept of event rates & population categories?  These are two different patient populations.

That trial had ""total symptom resolution"" as an endpoint, because they couldn't get the event-rate(3%) high enough(20%) to detect a benefit for the pre-specified primary endpoint, which was hospitalization. The patient population did too well, so they switched the endpoint without changing the design.

The reason they couldn't record all symptoms in that trial was because they didn't intend to; they only asked if the *every single one* of the patient's symptoms were better and at what time period.

In this trial they recorded specific symptoms and on top of that, recorded the period of hospitalization. This is different, because the one you linked is a hybrid in/outpatient trial and this is an inpatient trial. They measure different things in different populations, fundamentally.

This trial does not for example conflict with: [Mahmud](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04523831?view=results), [Elgazzar](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-100956/v3/53276668-6e01-4aca-ba91-62b0ba80afad.pdf), [Niaee](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-109670/v1/262874c7-d892-4fba-99c5-289f2b81fae1.pdf), [Hashim](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.26.20219345v1.full.pdf), [Chowdhury](https://ejmo.org/pdf/A%20Comparative%20Study%20on%20IvermectinDoxycycline%20and%20HydroxychloroquineAzithromycin%20Therapy%20on%20COVID19%20Patients-16263.pdf).

"**Abstract**

*3-Chymotrypsin-like* [*protease*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/proteinase) *(3CLpro) is a virally encoded main proteinase that is pivotal for the viral replication across a broad spectrum of* [*coronaviruses*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/coronavirinae)*. This study aims to discover the naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors from herbal constituents, as well as to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the newly identified efficacious SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. Following screening of the inhibitory potentials of eighty herbal products against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro,* [*Ginkgo biloba*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/ginkgo-biloba) *leaves extract (GBLE) was found with the most potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activity (IC50 = 6.68 μg/mL). Inhibition assays demonstrated that the ginkgolic acids (GAs) and the bioflavones isolated from GBLE displayed relatively strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities (IC50 < 10 μM). Among all tested constituents, GA C15:0, GA C17:1 and sciadopitysin displayed potent 3CLpro inhibition activities, with IC50 values of less than 2 μM. Further inhibition kinetic studies and docking simulations clearly demonstrated that two GAs and sciadopitysin strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro via a reversible and mixed inhibition manner. Collectively, this study found that both GBLE and the major constituents in this herbal product exhibit strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities, which offer several promising leading compounds for developing novel anti-COVID-19 medications via targeting on 3CLpro.*

"Highlights

The use of statins was significantly associated with lower mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

The protective effect of statins was similar to pneumonia patients in Korea, in 2019.

Statins can be considered as a part of the supportive regimen during the treatment of COVID-19.

Abstract

Objective:

Although statins are widely prescribed lipid-lowering drugs, there are concerns about the safety of their use in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), since statins increase the expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). This study aimed to disclose the association between statins and 60-day COVID-19 mortality.

Approach and Results:

All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study from January 19 to April 16, 2020, in Korea. We evaluated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19–related mortality in the overall and the nested 1:2 propensity score–matched study. Furthermore, a comparison of the hazard ratio for death was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea. The median age of the 10 448 COVID-19 patients was 45 years. Statins were prescribed in 533 (5.1%) patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in hazard ratio associated with the use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425–0.953]; P=0.0283). Moreover, on comparing the hazard ratio between COVID-19 patients and the retrospective cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients, the use of statins showed similar benefits.

Conclusions:

The use of statins correlates significantly with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19, consistent with the findings in patients with pneumonia.",n7udui,2021-05-08 18:43:49

"> to determine if prior infection by HCoVs is associated with differences in COVID-19 severity

I’m not understanding how they determined whether or not donors had prior infection by HCoVs. I am probably reading something wrong, so I’d appreciate a clarification. It sounds like, in fatal cases, they found higher titres of antibodies that react with both SARS-CoV2 and a subset of the endemic HCoVs, mostly at S2. But could this not simply be a response that reacted mostly to that area of the novel virus, rather than to the more unique S1 (which seems to be the best target for neutralization). How did the authors ascertain that a prior HCoV infection informed the (less effective) immune response?  Thanks in advance for your insight.",n7ehjz,2021-05-08 13:34:43

"SARS-CoV-2 isn't an entirely unique virus, it's genetic make-up shares some similarities with other viruses that have infected humans in the past. This includes some endemic viruses, meaning viruses that infect humans on a pretty regular basis, like the common cold viruses. You can think of the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and some endemic viruses like the genetic similarity between humans and primates - we share a good bit of DNA, but we're still different.

When SARS-CoV-2 infects our body, a healthy and normal response is to eventually create antibodies against it. Antibodies bind to parts of the virus, making it unable to infect cells and make us sick. The key idea here is that antibodies only bind to **part** of the virus. Depending on the individual, different antibodies can be made to bind to different parts of the virus - these parts are called ""epitopes"" in the paper.

This brings us back to the first point. Some epitopes (parts) of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to the epitopes in some endemic viruses, simply because they're like cousins. Primates have arms and opposable thumbs just like we do. What these researchers found was that compared to non-fatal cases, fatal cases of COVID-19 had a lot more antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are similar to endemic viruses, specifically in the spike protein. The authors briefly suggest that past infections with these endemic viruses may be affecting how some individuals battle COVID-19 (i.e. past infections with endemic viruses negatively influence COVID-19 outcomes)

Of course just remember that this is a pre-print, so it hasn't been peer-reviewed - take this with a grain of salt until it's been officially published in a journal!",n7ehjz,2021-05-08 06:50:23

If preexisting coronavirus exposure is associated with sterilizing but not protective immunity,  it could resolve the inconsistencies.

"Quote from their methods section:

> Since the investigated studies assessed the same outcome (the level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies) by using different metrics and methods, the results of the network meta-analysis expressed as relative effect (RE) and 95% credible interval (95% CrI) were converted into the standardized mean difference (SMD = (difference in mean outcome between groups) × (standard deviation of outcome among participants) −1).

The -1 here is as an exponent, so SMD is (mean neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated - mean neutralizing antibodies in unvaccinated) / (standard deviation of neutralizing antibodies among participants).

SMD is a tricky measure to work with at the best of times, because many things can cause standard deviation to differ across studies besides true differences in variability of response to each vaccine. In which case dividing each study’s mean difference by the standard deviation is not necessarily going to put everything on the same scale where you can meaningfully compare and say “vaccine X gives you more neutralizing antibodies than vaccine Y”, which seems to be this paper’s main goal.

(I’m also not sure whether use of SMD for measures of neutralizing antibodies is an appropriate use of SMD - anyone more familiar with the measures used for neutralizing antibodies and the underlying distributions able to shed some light on that?)

Also, MDPI doesn’t exactly have the best reputation for rigorous peer review. They were previously on Beall’s list of predatory open access publishers, and there have been claims from journal editors and staff about being pressured to accept low-quality papers for business reasons.

\- Are there any other studies like this that do a big comparison of immunogenicity of all the available vaccines? I'm in Asia and interim Phase 3 data for Sinopharm and Sinovac are impossible to find.",n7vh18,2021-05-08 19:48:27

"Thanks for the explanation. It also brings up the bigger question though:  


Is there an effective way of actually comparing immunogenicity across multiple vaccine types on a very large scale?   


From my understanding, even titer values can't be compared across different tests as the titer value is expressed as the highest dilution value that still gives a positive result on a test... and that test can vary. It's not a discrete value like units / volume.",n7vh18,2021-05-09 08:51:31

"Summary

Type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defense against virus infection. Recent studies have suggested the ability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to inhibit IFN responses. Emerging data also suggest that timing and extent of IFN production is associated with manifestation of COVID-19 severity. In spite of progress in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 activates antiviral responses, mechanistic studies into wild-type SARS-CoV-2-mediated induction and inhibition of human type I IFN responses are scarce. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a type I IFN response in vitro and in moderate cases of COVID-19. In vitro stimulation of type I IFN expression and signaling in human airway epithelial cells is associated with activation of canonical transcriptions factors, and SARS-CoV-2 is unable to inhibit exogenous induction of these responses. Furthermore, we show that physiological levels of IFNα detected in patients with moderate COVID-19 is sufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway cells.",n7tfnv,2021-05-08 17:58:10

"Abstract

Previous studies have shown that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing SAR-CoV-2 infection by generating an immune response, which in part produces SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. In this study, we hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines may elicit production of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the upper respiratory tract, such as in oral and nasal mucosal fluid. To test that hypothesis, we enrolled 114 participants within 3-7 days of receiving the first dose of the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and collected oral mucosal fluid samples on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 after each vaccine dose. Of participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 (n = 89), 79 (85.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by time point 2 (10 days +/-2 days after first vaccine dose), and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by time point 3 (15 days +/- 2 days after first vaccine dose). Additionally, we collected paired oral mucosal fluid and anterior nares samples from 10 participants who had received both vaccine doses. We found that participants had an average SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody concentration of 2496.0 +/- 2698.0ng/mL in nasal mucosal fluid versus 153.4 +/- 141.0ng/mL in oral mucosal fluid. Here, we demonstrate detection and longitudinal persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. A high concentration of IgG targeting viral spike protein in the upper respiratory system may play an unexplored role in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and deserves further investigation",n7ejnx,2021-05-08 06:20:32

"> **Abstract**

>Rapid ramp up of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 during pandemic enables adequate prevention and treatment for COVID-19. Estimating levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies post vaccination is crucial for designing mass-vaccination strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of Sputnik V first dose in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study of 2000 participants was conducted for examining Gam-COVID-Vac or Sputnik V first dose effects at 21st days post administration at Islamabad Diagnostic Center, Islamabad, Pakistan. From 100 real-time PCR negative (SARS-CoV-2 RNA) individuals, samples were collected and analyzed for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (Elecsys # 09289267190 Roche, USA). 85% of the participants showed strong positive results with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies > 1.5 AU/ml. The individuals with antibody titer > 250 AU/ml were 34.9%. Among those with antibody levels > 250 AU/ml 52% had previous history of COVID-19 infection. While participants with > 100 AU/ml of antibodies were 12.7%. However 9.5% showed antibody titer of > 25 AU/ml. 27% of participants had antibody titers of > 1.5–2.5 AU/ml. While antibody titers of < 1.5 AU/ml were observed among 15.9% of participants. Majority of the individuals represented significantly high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 even before second booster dose of Ad5 based Sputnik V vaccine. Continuous monitoring of antibody levels among COVID-19 vaccinated populations are deemed to assess humoral immunity status against SARS-CoV-2 infections.",n820nv,2021-05-09 01:10:54

Does this mean it will move beyond emergency authorization?,n6wbu3,2021-05-07 15:54:00
">NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, May 7, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of their mRNA vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. Data to support the BLA will be submitted by the Companies to the FDA on a rolling basis over the coming weeks, with a request for Priority Review. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA will be set once the BLA is complete and formally accepted for review by the agency.

>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is currently available in the U.S. under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA on December 11, 2020. Since then, the Companies have delivered more than 170 million doses of the vaccine across the U.S. Submission of a BLA, which requires longer-term follow-up data for acceptance and approval, is the next step in the rigorous FDA review process. 

>“We are proud of the tremendous progress we’ve made since December in delivering vaccines to millions of Americans, in collaboration with the U.S. Government,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “We look forward to working with the FDA to complete this rolling submission and support their review, with the goal of securing full regulatory approval of the vaccine in the coming months.”

>“Following the successful delivery of more than 170 million doses to the U.S. population in just a few months, the BLA submission is an important cornerstone of achieving long-term herd immunity and containing COVID-19 in the future,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “We are pleased to work with U.S. regulators to seek approval of our COVID-19 vaccine based on our pivotal Phase 3 trial and follow-up data.”

>Pfizer and BioNTech initiated the BLA by submitting the nonclinical and clinical data needed to support licensure of the COVID-19 vaccine for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. This includes the most recent analyses from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, where the vaccine’s efficacy and favorable safety profile were observed up to 6 months after the second dose. The Companies will submit the required manufacturing and facility data for licensure in the coming weeks to complete the BLA. 

>Pfizer and BioNTech also have submitted an application to expand the current EUA for their COVID-19 vaccine to include individuals 12 to 15 years of age. The Companies intend to submit a supplemental BLA to support licensure of the vaccine in this age group once the required data 6 months after the second vaccine dose are available.",n6wbu3,2021-05-07 12:30:19

VUI-21APR-02 (B.1.617.2) was escalated to a variant of concern on 6 May 2021 (VOC- 21APR-02). It is assessed as having at least equivalent transmissibility to B.1.1.7 based on available data (moderate confidence). There are insufficient data currently to assess the potential for immune escape.

VOC-21Apr-02 looks like the B.1.617.2 variant imported from India, and seems like it’s significantly on the rise - it’s also the steepest green line on Page 10. And with a nearly 2x higher secondary attack rate relative to B.1.1.7 (3.3% vs. 1.9%), it might explain why it exploded so much in India... Interesting that you see that distinction for contacts of someone who traveled, but for local transmission there isn’t as large of a disparity (10.1% vs 9.5%). I wonder if that’s noise, or perhaps a function of a longer incubation time for the Indian variant (I.e. it’s still infectious following travel).

For example, B.1.617.2 is mostly imported from India, and a flight from India is relatively long, giving more time to infect contacts on the plane. It could even be a function of something like different seating arrangements on different airlines.

The local transmission number is probably more reliable (even though the sample size is smaller).",n79guv,2021-05-08 03:29:31

B1.1.7 is likely to remain the dominant strain (excluding things like the founder effect, or vaccine evasion) as B.1.617.2 doesn’t look to me to be more transmissible.

"Objective: To report a case series of dysautonomia associated with COVID-19 infection.

Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients evaluated in the autonomic clinic at our institution with suspected signs and symptoms of dysautonomia who underwent formal evaluation, including autonomic testing.

Results: Six patients were identified with signs and symptoms suggestive of dysautonomia who underwent autonomic testing. All patients had symptoms typical of COVID-19 infection, though none were hospitalized for these or other symptoms. All patients reported symptoms of postural lightheadedness and near-syncope, fatigue, and activity intolerance. Five patients reported the onset of autonomic symptoms concomitant with other COVID-19 symptoms, with the other patient reporting symptom onset 6 weeks following initial COVID-19 symptoms. Autonomic testing demonstrated an excessive postural tachycardia in 4 patients, a hypertensive response with head-up tilt in 3 patients, orthostatic hypotension in 1 patient, and sudomotor impairment in 1 of the patients with excessive postural tachycardia.

Conclusions: We present clinical features and results of autonomic testing in 6 patients with a history COVID-19 infection. While all patients reported typical features of orthostatic intolerance, fatigue, and activity intolerance, the results of autonomic testing were heterogenous, with orthostatic hypotension in 1 patient, excessive postural tachycardia typical of postural tachycardia syndrome in 4 patients, and postural hypertension in 3 patients.",n79e85,2021-05-07 22:24:30

"Abstract

Background: Clinical trial guidelines for assessing the safety of vaccines, including the FDA criteria, are primarily based on subjective, self-reported questionnaires. Despite the tremendous technological advances in recent years, objective, continuous assessment of physiological measures post-vaccination is rarely performed. Methods: To evaluate the short-term effects of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine on physiological measures, we conducted a prospective observational study during the mass vaccination campaign in Israel. 160 individuals >18 years who were not previously found to be COVID-19 positive and who received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine between 1 January 2021, and 13 March 2021 were equipped with a chest-patch sensor and a dedicated mobile application. The chest-patch sensor continuously measured 13 physiological vitals one day before the inoculation (baseline), for four days: heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate variability, stroke volume, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and body temperature. The mobile application collected daily self-reported questionnaires starting one day before the inoculation, for 15 days on local and systemic reactions, sleep quality, stress levels, physical activity, and mood levels. Findings: Within the first 48 hours post-vaccination, we identified significant changes (p-value <0.05) in nearly all 13 chest-patch indicators compared to their baseline levels. 48.5% (n=78) reported no local or systemic reaction. Nevertheless, we identified considerable changes in chest-patch indicators during the first 48 hours post-vaccination also in this group of presumably asymptomatic participants. Within three days from vaccination, these measures returned to baseline levels in both groups, further supporting the safety of the vaccine. Interpretation: Our work underscores the importance of obtaining objective physiological data in addition to self-reported questionnaires when performing clinical trials, particularly in ones conducted in very short time frames.",n797y6,2021-05-08 15:33:05

"Sleep disruption also remarkably elevates IL-6 if memory serves me.

Obvious also the connection to obesity as a risk factor.

Since this study focuses on survivors and identifies potentially previously undiagnosed cases it wont illuminate that its probably equally relevant to those who die of COVID19. 

And a very recent thread on here discusses that IL-6 continues increasing in those that die of COVID19 and peaks and declines in survivors.",n6hory,2021-05-07 00:24:07
"**Abstract**


Study Objectives- Studies have found Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) as a risk factor for increased risk for COVID19 Acute respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS); but most of the studies were done in already known patients of OSA. This study was done to find prevalence of OSA in patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome. Methodology- A hospital based longitudinal study was conducted among COVID 19 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors. All consecutive COVID19 with moderate to severe ARDS were evaluated for OSA by Level I Polysomnography (PSG) after 4-6 weeks of discharge. Prevalence of OSA and PSG variables {Total sleep time, Sleep efficiency, sleep stage percentage, Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI), T90, nadir oxygen} was estimated. Results- Out of 103 patients discharged from ICU during study period (October 2020 to 15 December 2020), 67 underwent Level I PSG. Mean Age was 52.6 years and mean Body Mass Index was 27.5 Kg/m2. Total sleep time was 343.2 minutes, sleep efficiency was 75.9. OSA (AHI more than 5 ) was seen in 65/67 patients and 49 patients had moderate to severe OSA (i.e. AHI more than 15). Conclusion- Moderate-severe OSA was highly prevalent (73%) in COVID19 moderate to severe ARDS survivors.

"yes you are right but having a recessed jaw also can contribute. So we should be able to gain some insight if sleep apnea is more correlated than just obesity or BMI alone, since if they measure both things in survivors there will be a general trend but also cases of sleep apnea in people without high BMI, and if its just a proxy for obesity thats being measured here. For example, if there are obese patients without sleep apnea, if they have lower than expected severity, that might indicate an independent role for sleep apnea.",n6hory,2021-05-07 01:43:44
"While Obesity is a primary factor, in many young OSA patients its caused by anatomical features.  There is OSA and there is also UARS. 

This study raises more questions though: Was OSA due to the  lung issues caused by COVID? How do the authors rule this out?",n6hory,2021-05-07 04:16:31
"> in many young OSA patients its caused by anatomical features

Yep. Was diagnosed in my mid 40s and the doc said it was not due to obesity (since I wasn't obese at the time) but due to anatomical features of my jaw and palate. This paper says up to 54% of people with OSA are not obese: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27655455/",n6hory,2021-05-07 20:28:36
Aren’t we currently seeing a micro-evolution in jaw alignments due to softer diets? Wonder if that will cause a spike. People are generally eating less meat and it is causing softer and more recessed jaw alignments.,n6hory,2021-05-08 00:26:57

I'm skeptical that this should be taken as true without qualification.

Indeed, constant circulating antibodies of the same type over very long periods are more usually evidence of autoimmunity rather than immune protection.

The analysis included 12 cases starting 14 days after first dose and based on the CDC definition of COVID-19, which requires one COVID-19 symptom and paired with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Because the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in adolescents, the case definition is less stringent than for COVE, resulting in vaccine efficacy against milder disease. The median duration for follow-up in this initial analysis was 35 days following the second dose. mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. No serious safety concerns have been identified to date. The most common solicited local adverse event was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events after the second dose of mRNA-1273 were headache, fatigue, myalgia and chills. The Company is continuing to collect data in TeenCOVE and is in discussions with regulators about a potential amendment to its regulatory filings.

"Abstract

The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech was the first registered COVID-19 vaccine and has been shown to be up to 95% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Little is known about the broad effects of the new class of mRNA vaccines, especially whether they have combined effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli. The response of innate immune cells to TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2 vaccination, while fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion, the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this new class of vaccines.",n69u8w,2021-05-06 16:35:08

If there are not previous studies, is that because we just haven't been paying attention, or does it legitimately just ""not happen"" (at least not very frequently) with other viruses?

If it actually doesn't happen with non-novel viruses, I guess the hypothesis would be that prior infection from before the patient became immunocompromised still grants some immunity, e.g. because the ""memory"" immune system still functions, it's really the ""deal with new things"" part of the immune system that completely fails, and prevents the immune system from adapting to a virus it hasn't seen before.",n5yeop,2021-05-06 19:06:41
"This is why the western vaccines used a 
sub-unit vaccine platform, which specifically codes for only the S-1 spike protein, for every vaccine currently available and being developed. There are some preliminary studies showing that some areas of this virus may inhibit our body’s cytokines. Triggering these cytokines is what activates our adaptive immune system(b-cells and their antibodies that prevent infecting our cells and t-cells which destroy infected cells that have been turned into virus making factories). For proof of this concept look at the much low efficacy seen in China’s SinoVac vaccine which uses an attenuated vaccine platform-it uses the entire virus specifically altered so it cannot replicate.  Look into changes in the “germinal center” too for more information on this topic.

 What is already known on this topic

* Spontaneous adverse event reports and clinical case series have described thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and arterial and venous thromboses occurring within days to weeks after vaccination with the Oxford-AstraZeneca covid-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1-S)
* Whether these cases represent excess events above expected rates is unknown

#### What this study adds

* Increased rates for venous thromboembolism were observed within 28 days of vaccination with ChAdOx1-S in Denmark and Norway, corresponding to 11 excess events per 100 000 vaccinations, including 2.5 excess cerebral venous thrombosis events per 100 000 vaccinations
* Results were largely reassuring for arterial events, whereas slightly increased rates of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders and bleeding in the vaccinated group could be influenced by heightened surveillance
* Absolute risks of events were small and should be interpreted in the context of the benefits of covid-19 vaccination at both the societal and the individual level",n5zrnu,2021-05-06 15:38:16

Well, privacy and big-data aside, this also makes the system quick to pickup any changes to any cohorts because automated analysis (AI) is running on various cohorts.

I am personally pretty convinced that the numbers are close in the UK but aren't being picked up - both because the German data is close to DK/NO data, and because the cases have been steadily rising albeit very slowly in MHRA rapports.",n5zrnu,2021-05-06 10:52:31
"The obvious problem was with old UK data which was frequently cited in media and used in combination with data from other countries and newer UK data. e.g. based on tables in [EMA's PRAC report (19p)](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/prac-recommendation/signal-assessment-report-embolic-thrombotic-events-smq-covid-19-vaccine-chadox1-s-recombinant-covid_en.pdf) after 2.1M people in 30-49 age group were vaccinated with AZ in EEA at least 11 cases of  CVST and 4 cases of DIC have occured in 14d after vaccination, in contrast UK have found only 1 CVST case and 0 DIC cases after 3.3M people of the same age group got vaccinated. Latter UK started to find orders of magnitude more cases, but I still haven't seen explanation whether part of those were found in old data and if so, how many. 

As for the second point I'm not sure it's easy to miss something like CVST even in normal times. Ofcourse ""blood clots with low platelets"" is a more vague term and proportion of missed cases strongly depend on used definition and the extent of proactive testing nowadays.

Whoever state anything confidently in this matter is probably wrong. This is a cohort study suggesting their facts humbly. No conclusion should be drawn from this.

This is not the whole picture, just a better view of the problem compared to case studies. 

It could still be better to vaccinate if you look at population in whole. I for one would like a good study from UK where more vaccine have been given. Last I looked they had 4 cases with VITT from dose 2.",n5zrnu,2021-05-06 20:47:08

"Yeah, it is a safe vaccine, population-wise. But is it safe *for me?*",n5zrnu,2021-05-06 21:56:15
"It's pity that these prevalence numbers are usually communicated without any kind of confidence interval (acknowledging its all limitations), though 1 in 40k might not be that bad guess, even so that vaccinated population in DK/NO doesn't represent general population well. [EMA analysis](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/chmp-annex/annex-vaxzevria-art53-visual-risk-contextualisation_en.pdf) has most data (though it's probably skewed with bad data and missed cases, thus in reality risks are higher) and they were communicating, that probability of ""cases of blood clots with low platelets"" are between 1.8 and 2.1 in 100k for age groups between 20 and 49. It should be higher in females, but the question is by how much as vaccination distribution by sex is not added. Also criterion of ""low platelets""/""thrombocytopenia"" should exclude some vaccination induced cases of serious thrombotic events and it's not trivial. e.g. in [this PRAC report (49p-51p)](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/prac-recommendation/signal-assessment-report-embolic-thrombotic-events-smq-covid-19-vaccine-chadox1-s-recombinant_en.pdf) they analyse 57 thromboembolic cases with thrombocytopenia of which 33 were CVST with thrombocytopenia, but additionally they have found 29 CVST cases without it, which was significantly higher than expected in certain age groups. Those 29 cases thus should not be added to the stats cited above. Also there should be at least some other vaccine induced thrombotic events in other places of body which are excluded by the same criterion. Though it's not clear the extent to which the cases are missed as it might be an artefact of days in past when people wasn't looking so closely to platelet count when someone got complications after AZ jab. My current guess is that serious complications might be close to 1 in 10k for younger females (though I have no confidence in guessing particular risk distribution by age), but way lower for the rest of population.",n5zrnu,2021-05-06 23:33:48
"This is the real question. Stats that are averaged across the population aren't optimally helpful, since we know there's a specific risk demographic (women 20-60), and incidence rates are going to be vastly higher inside that, and vastly lower outside it.",n5zrnu,2021-05-09 07:41:18

adverse events assessed during the immunogenicity evaluation period, may be sufficient

evaluation of the modified COVID-19 vaccine in a larger safety database than initially 
planned for immunogenicity studies may be warranted if safety signals arise (e.g., 
following a booster [3rd] dose), and studies should also plan for longer-term assessments

"> This case-control study enrolled 24 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient …

Wow! Huge! Twenty four actual cases?",n65zjh,2021-05-06 16:51:06
"Background

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and over 80 million cases and over 1.8 million deaths were reported in 2020. This highly contagious virus is spread primarily via respiratory droplets from face-to-face contact and contaminated surfaces as well as potential aerosol spread. Over half of transmissions occur from presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. Although several vaccines are currently available for emergency use, there are uncertainties regarding the duration of protection and the efficacy of preventing asymptomatic spread. Thus, personal protective health behaviour and measures against COVID-19 are still widely recommended after immunization. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of these measures, and the results may provide valuable guidance to policymakers to educate the general public about how to reduce the individual-level risk of COVID-19 infection.

## Methods

\>This case-control study enrolled 24 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (C.H.C.S.J.), which was the only hospital designated to manage COVID-19 patients in Macao SAR, China, and 1113 control participants who completed a 14-day mandatory quarantine in 12 designated hotels due to returning from high-risk countries between 17 March and 15 April 2020. A questionnaire was developed to extract demographic information, contact history, and personal health behaviour.

## Results

Participants primarily came from the United Kingdom (33.2%), followed by the United States (10.5%) and Portugal (10.2%). Independent factors for COVID-19 infection were having physical contact with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR, 12.108 \[95% CI, 3.380–43.376\], *P* < 0.005), participating in high-risk gathering activities (adjusted OR, 1.129 \[95% CI, 1.048–1.216\], *P* < 0.005), handwashing after outdoor activity (adjusted OR, 0.021 \[95% CI, 0.003–0.134\], *P* < 0.005), handwashing before touching the mouth and nose area (adjusted OR, 0.303 \[95% CI, 0.114–0.808\], *P* < 0.05), and wearing a mask whenever outdoors (adjusted OR, 0.307 \[95% CI, 0.109–0.867\], *P* < 0.05). The daily count of handwashing remained similar between groups. Only 31.6% of participants had a sufficient 20-s handwashing duration.

## Conclusions

Participating in high-risk gatherings, wearing a mask whenever outdoors, and practising hand hygiene at key times should be advocated to the public to mitigate COVID-19 infection.

&#x200B;

Seems like there's a typo in the conclusion - ""Participating in high-risk gatherings.... should be advocated"" Perhaps it should start ""When participating in...""",n65zjh,2021-05-06 14:55:50

"Abstract

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply in recent weeks and a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyzed whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 entered two out of eight cell lines tested with slightly increased efficiency and was blocked by entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 was resistant against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. Finally, B.1.617 evaded antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although with moderate efficiency. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.",n5scal,2021-05-05 23:24:47

"Abstract

Recent studies have provided insights into innate and adaptive immune dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the exact features of antibody responses that govern COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed humoral immune responses in 229 patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. Although high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed, response, measured by anti-S, anti-receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, although sera from 85% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation before 14 d of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se but, rather, with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.",n5nr31,2021-05-05 20:04:33

"Summary

Background

Following the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 6·5 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine.

Methods

We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years), sex, and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant.

Findings

During the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72·1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2. Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 95·3% (95% CI 94·9–95·7; incidence rate 91·5 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 3·1 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91·5% (90·7–92·2; 40·9 vs 1·8 per 100 000 person-days) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 97·0% (96·7–97·2; 32·5 vs 0·8 per 100 000 person-days) against symptomatic COVID-19, 97·2% (96·8–97·5; 4·6 vs 0·3 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 97·5% (97·1–97·8; 2·7 vs 0·2 per 100 000 person-days) against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and 96·7% (96·0–97·3; 0·6 vs 0·1 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related death. In all age groups, as vaccine coverage increased, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure, giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 94·5% among SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Interpretation

Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (≥16 years, including older adults aged ≥85 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.",n5so6o,2021-05-05 23:40:01

"Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has posed a global threat to human lives and economics. One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. Based on available studies, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown. The findings suggest that this route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.",n60jyu,2021-05-06 12:42:26

"Abstract

BACKGROUND

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. In a phase 1–2 trial involving healthy adults, the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and was associated with strong neutralizing-antibody and antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy was needed in a setting of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

METHODS

In this phase 2a–b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 μg of recombinant spike protein with 50 μg of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary end points were safety and vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

RESULTS

Of 6324 participants who underwent screening, 4387 received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. Approximately 30% of the participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative and 6% HIV-positive), predominantly mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 15 participants in the vaccine group and in 29 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 49.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 72.8). Vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI, 19.9 to 80.1). Of 41 sequenced isolates, 38 (92.7%) were the B.1.351 variant. Post hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI, −0.6 to 76.2) among the HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity events were more common in the vaccine group; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

CONCLUSIONS

The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, with higher vaccine efficacy observed among HIV-negative participants. Most infections were caused by the B.1.351 variant.",n5qplu,2021-05-06 01:09:50

"#Abstract

**Background:** Immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination has been threatened by recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants. A systematic summary of the landscape of neutralizing antibodies against emerging variants is needed.

**Methods:** We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and 3 pre-print servers for studies that evaluated neutralizing antibodies titers induced by previous infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 variants and comprehensively collected individual data. We calculated lineage-specific GMTs across different study participants and types of neutralization assays.

**Findings:** We identified 56 studies, including 2,483 individuals and 8,590 neutralization tests, meeting the eligibility criteria. Compared with lineage B, we estimate a 1.5-fold (95% CI: 1.0-2.2) reduction in neutralization against the B.1.1.7, 8.7-fold (95% CI: 6.5-11.7) reduction against B.1.351 and 5.0-fold (95% CI: 4.0-6.2) reduction against P.1. The estimated neutralization reductions for B.1.351 compared to lineage B were 240.2-fold (95% CI: 124.0-465.6) reduction for non-replicating vector platform, 4.6-fold (95% CI: 4.0-5.2) reduction for RNA platform, and 1.6-fold (95% CI: 1.2-2.1) reduction for protein subunit platform. The neutralizing antibodies induced by administration of inactivated vaccines and mRNA vaccines against lineage P.1 were also remarkably reduced by an average of 5.9-fold (95% CI: 3.7-9.3) and 1.5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-1.9).

**Interpretation:** Our findings indicate that the antibody response established by natural infection or vaccination might be able to effectively neutralize B.1.1.7, but neutralizing titers against B.1.351 and P.1 suffered large reductions. Standardized protocols for neutralization assays, as well as updating immune-based prevention and treatment, are needed.",n5lvik,2021-05-05 21:40:41

"**Abstract**  
Recently, the antibody titer levels have been followed in 33 adults who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine for 6 months. With single dose estimated effectiveness of 92.1%, we combine this knowledge with corresponding antibody levels to model and estimate the long-term durability of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Additionally, we integrate studies about differences in antibody neutralization to SARS-CoV-2 variants to understand how variants can affect the durability of the vaccine. The estimated days after first injection for binding antibodies to fall below levels of those from day 15 is 411 days. The estimated days after first injection to fall below the lower limit of detection of 20 GMTs is 327 days for pseudovirus neutralization and 461 days for live virus neutralization. Our model has pseudovirus neutralization against variant B.1.351 falling below 20 GMT on day 100; variant P.1 on day 202, variant B.1.429 on day 258; and variant B.1.1.7 on day 309. The data used contains many limitations including the small sample size with older age bias, sensitivity of the neutralization assays, and limited data on variants. Still, we believe mRNA-1273 two dose vaccine can provide over a year of protection against COVID-19 from the initial D614G variant. It is likely by the second year, protection against COVID-19 will fall below single dose efficacy. Therefore, there should be consideration for a booster shot a year after the first set of vaccines. If there is an observed increase in variants with higher resistance such as B.1.351 and P.1, a booster vaccine against the newer variants should be considered to increase protection against resistant variants",n5a4oy,2021-05-05 08:25:56

"Any reason that they’re focusing on first dose levels? And does this imply that the second dose doesn’t prolong the antibody levels further than just the first dose, or is this saying that first dose does almost all the antibody level work and we don’t really know if the second dose prolongs it or has little effect?

Edit: never mind, I read it again and I guess it’s saying that getting the second dose does indeed prolong the protection and keep it “above” first dose levels.",n5a4oy,2021-05-05 16:12:29
"Right, so there's much more to the story. We already know that other immune cells for Covid like B and T cells persist (especially after vaccination) much longer than antibodies, as expected. So declining antibodies is not the same as declining immune protection.",n5a4oy,2021-05-05 17:15:44

"Effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed, and preclinical data suggest alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (α1-AR antagonists) may be effective in reducing mortality related to hyperinflammation independent of etiology. Using a retrospective cohort design with patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, we use doubly robust regression and matching to estimate the association between baseline use of α1-AR antagonists and likelihood of death due to COVID-19 during hospitalization. Having an active prescription for any α1-AR antagonist (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin) at the time of admission had a significant negative association with in-hospital mortality (relative risk reduction 18%; odds ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85; p ≤ 0.001) and death within 28 days of admission (relative risk reduction 17%; odds ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.84; p ≤ 0.001). **In a subset of patients on doxazosin specifically, an inhibitor of all three alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, we observed a relative risk reduction for death of 74% (odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; p = 0.028) compared to matched controls not on any α1-AR antagonist at the time of admission.

" This seems like a strange study unless I'm missing something?

""In the comparison of the outcomes between patients who received aspirin and those who did not, the need for mechanical ventilation was in 54 (16.07%) and 90 (13.74%) patients, respectively (P=0.324). The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in patients who received aspirin (P<0.001) and the mortality occurred in 109 (32.4%) and 147 (22.44%) patients, respectively (P=0.001).""

So, the aspirin group did WORSE.

But because the aspirin group had more elderly patients and more comorbidity, they're analyzing the numbers to say it was better - which I understand theoretically, but why couldn't they get a better matched control and treatment group? 

And I didn't see anywhere where they give the amount of risk reduction, just that it was signifiant. I hate when studies give a significant P value but no risk reduction numbers - a 1% risk reduction could be significant in a large enough sample.",n4kupg,2021-05-04 19:50:00
"Introduction

Hypercoagulability and thrombosis caused by COVID-19 is related to the higher mortality rate. Because of limited data on antiplatelet effect, we aimed to evaluate the impact of aspirin add-on therapy on the outcome of the patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19.

Materials and methods

In this cohort study, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19 admitted to Imam Hossein Medical Center, Tehran, Iran from March 2019 to July 2020 were included. Demographics and related clinical data during their hospitalization were recorded. The mortality rate of the patients was considered as the primary outcome and its association with aspirin use was assessed.

Results

Nine hundred and ninety-one patients were included that 336 patients of them (34%) received aspirin during their hospitalization and 655 ones (66%) did not. Comorbidities were more prevalent in the patients who were receiving aspirin. Results from the multivariate COX proportional model demonstrated a significant independent association between aspirin use and reduction in risk of in-hospital mortality (0.746[0.560-0.994], P=0.046).

Conclusions

Aspirin use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Further prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of aspirin administration in this population",n4kupg,2021-05-04 11:16:53

But there are other studies distinctly showing the covid nightmare is fibrin clots, not platelet based. If you look for images, again I sadly cannot link here, it's a spaghetti mess of fibrin with everything caught inside and building, covid and platelets all trapped like garbage at the bottom of a dam.

In COVID-19, it has been found that severe cases have high levels of this other type of clot that is stable independently from fibrin. Aspirin can reduce platelet aggregation which can limit those clots from forming.",n4kupg,2021-05-04 16:24:37

Supports the hypothesis that CVT events are not related to the mRNA vaccines. That’s good.,n4snvn,2021-05-04 22:28:39
Yes the best thing to come out of this COVID19 mess is the introduction of mRNA vaccines into our medicine toolkit. Ultimately I think 100 years from now mRNA vaccines are going to save many more lives than COVID19 stole. I was personally in 2020 an initial skeptic of mRNA vaccines being employed with so little validation testing but now in 2021 based on the literature I'd much rather receive an mRNA vaccine than an adeno-virus based one.,n4snvn,2021-05-05 02:53:55
"How did you come to that conclusion? “these findings point towards and higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women.” Very last sentence of the article.",n4snvn,2021-05-05 14:48:08
"ChAdOx1 is AstraZeneca’s vector vaccine. The paper actually has a hypothesis section and then conclusions to their hypothesis. They sort of serve it up for you, hard to miss.

“Individuals in Germany were vaccinated with ChAdOx1, mRNA-1273 andBNT162b2. In our study,  CVTs with a VITT risk score >2 only occurred after vaccination with   ChAdOx1.”",n4snvn,2021-05-05 14:55:57
"But even in what you just put it discusses a risk of CVT, albeit low, but a risk nonetheless so I don’t understand how your original comment can be accurate if the paper itself is saying there is a risk of this after receiving the vaccine.",n4snvn,2021-05-05 15:26:10
"Sorry, not following. I said this paper supports the hypothesis that CVT is not related to mRNA vaccines, and the paper does exactly that.",n4snvn,2021-05-05 15:31:31
"Oh, I apologize. I misunderstood what you were saying. The AstraZeneca vaccine is vector. I was just struggling with reading the same paper and getting a different conclusion, but now I realize where I was confused. With known CVT events in the Pfizer cohort I am hesitant to say that the mRNA vaccines aren’t correlated (not necessarily causal) with increased incidences of CVT though based on this article unless I’m missing something else?",n4snvn,2021-05-05 15:52:38

"Abstract

T cells are critical for control of viral infection and effective vaccination. We investigated whether prior Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) or Tetanus-Diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccination elicit cross-reactive T cells that mitigate COVID-19. Using co-cultures of antigen presenting cells (APC) loaded with antigens and autologous T cells, we found a high correlation between responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Spike-S1 and Nucleocapsid) and MMR and Tdap vaccine proteins in both SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and individuals immunized with mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The overlapping T cell population contained effector memory T cells (TEMRA) previously implicated in anti-viral immunity and their activation required APC-derived IL-15. TCR- and scRNA-sequencing detected cross-reactive clones with TEMRA features among the cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2, MMR and Tdap epitopes. A propensity-weighted analysis of 73,582 COVID-19 patients revealed that severe disease outcomes (hospitalization and transfer to intensive care unit or death) were reduced in MMR or Tdap vaccinated individuals by 38-32% and 23-20% respectively. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 re-activates memory T cells generated by Tdap and MMR vaccines, which may reduce disease severity.",n5004y,2021-05-05 01:23:20

"Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 has caused a historic pandemic of respiratory disease (COVID-19) and current evidence suggests severe disease is associated with dysregulated immunity within the respiratory tract. However, the innate immune mechanisms that mediate protection during COVID-19 are not well defined. Here we characterize a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and find that early CCR2-dependent infiltration of monocytes restricts viral burden in the lung. We find that a recently developed mouse-adapted MA-SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as the emerging B.1.351 variant, trigger an inflammatory response in the lung characterized by expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes. scRNA-seq analysis of lung homogenates identified a hyper-inflammatory monocyte profile. Using intravital antibody labeling, we demonstrate that MA-SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to increases in circulating monocytes and an influx of CD45+ cells into the lung parenchyma that is dominated by monocyte-derived cells. We utilize this model to demonstrate that mechanistically, CCR2 signaling promotes infiltration of classical monocytes into the lung and expansion of monocyte-derived cells. Parenchymal monocyte-derived cells appear to play a protective role against MA-SARS-CoV-2, as mice lacking CCR2 showed higher viral loads in the lungs, increased lung viral dissemination, and elevated inflammatory cytokine responses. These studies have identified a CCR2-monocyte axis that is critical for promoting viral control and restricting inflammation within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",n53qki,2021-05-05 02:21:40

"Abstract

Recently, two mRNA vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become available, but there is also an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility and virulence. A major concern is whether the available vaccines will be equally effective against these variants. The vaccines are designed to induce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is required for viral entry to host cells. Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is often evaluated by antibody production, while less is known about the T-cell response. Here we developed, characterized, and implemented two standardized, functional assays to measure T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected, convalescent, and vaccinated individuals. We found that vaccinated individuals had robust T-cell responses to the wild type spike and nucleocapsid proteins, even more so than convalescent patients. We also found detectable but diminished T-cell responses to spike variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248) among vaccinated but otherwise healthy donors. Since decreases in antibody neutralization have also been observed with some variants, investigation into the T-cell response to these variants as an alternative means of viral control is imperative. Standardized measurements of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are feasible and can be easily adjusted to determine changes in response to variants.",n4hftn,2021-05-04 11:22:52

"Do the authors attempt to contextualize Sweden's actual numbers as being pretty much right in the middle of European countries, given that many of those countries did follow the protocol their modelling gives such starkly different results for?",n4nt81,2021-05-04 18:42:25
">Still, the Swedish authorities merely advised—rather than ordered—citizens to adjust their behavior in the face of the pandemic. For instance, people were told “to avoid unnecessary traveling and social events, to keep distance to others, and to stay at home” if they had any symptoms. In addition, those above age 70 were “advised to avoid social contact” and “visits to retirement homes” were banned [[6](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249732#pone.0249732.ref006)].

This is kind of misleading because Sweden legally limited public crowd sizes to 500, then to 50 during the period studied as well as switched universities and high schools to distance learning. This will be captured in the stringency index they are using but it makes me question their contextual knowledge about Sweden.

"**Abstract**

While most countries imposed a lockdown in response to the first wave of COVID-19 infections, Sweden did not. To quantify the lockdown effect, we approximate a counterfactual lockdown scenario for Sweden through the outcome in a synthetic control unit. We find, first, that a 9-week lockdown in the first half of 2020 would have reduced infections and deaths by about 75% and 38%, respectively. Second, the lockdown effect starts to materialize with a delay of 3–4 weeks only. Third, the actual adjustment of mobility patterns in Sweden suggests there has been substantial voluntary social restraint, although the adjustment was less strong than under the lockdown scenario. Lastly, we find that a lockdown would not have caused much additional output loss.",n4nt81,2021-05-04 14:03:17
"I can't speak to the authors' conclusions about how effective a lockdown in Sweden would've been, but I find the claim that a lockdown wouldn't have substantially affected output specious; the fact that much of Europe was under restrictive lockdowns likely affected Sweden economically already.

This article explicitly says that because the social cost wasn't measured that we cannot make a final conclusion on the cost benefits of lockdowns.

>Last, we stress that our study focuses on benefits of a lockdown in terms of limiting COVID-19 infections and deaths. We find that these benefits are not trivial.

"Abstract

The molecular composition and binding epitopes of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that circulate in blood plasma following SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown. Proteomic deconvolution of the IgG repertoire to the spike glycoprotein in convalescent subjects revealed that the response is directed predominantly (>80%) against epitopes residing outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD). In one subject, just four IgG lineages accounted for 93.5% of the response, including an N-terminal domain (NTD)-directed antibody that was protective against lethal viral challenge. Genetic, structural, and functional characterization of a multi-donor class of “public” antibodies revealed an NTD epitope that is recurrently mutated among emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These data show that “public” NTD-directed and other non-RBD plasma antibodies are prevalent and have implications for SARS-CoV-2 protection and antibody escape.",n4uxnh,2021-05-04 19:53:44

"**Abstract**

Whereas recent investigations have revealed viral, inflammatory and vascular factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 lung pathogenesis, the pathophysiology of neurological disorders in COVID-19 remains poorly understood. Olfactory and taste dysfunction are common in COVID-19, especially in mildly symptomatic patients. Here, we conducted a virologic, molecular, and cellular study of the olfactory neuroepithelium of seven patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute loss of smell. We report evidence that the olfactory neuroepithelium may be a major site of SARS-CoV2 infection with multiple cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells, and immune cells, becoming infected. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the olfactory neuroepithelium was associated with local inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced acute anosmia and ageusia in golden Syrian hamsters, lasting as long as the virus remained in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Finally, olfactory mucosa sampling from patients showing long-term persistence of COVID-19-associated anosmia revealed the presence of virus transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, together with protracted inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 persistence and associated inflammation in the olfactory neuroepithelium may account for prolonged or relapsing symptoms of COVID-19, such as loss of smell, which should be considered for optimal medical management of this disease.",n435ys,2021-05-03 20:27:42

"This is a significant and interesting find. Though it says that the virus persists in the region, it doesnt say if the virus can be shed from that place, which would be a very important area of investigation. Another thing is that the persistent presence of the virus in the olfactory area of the nose makes me think of how some herpes infection begin with localized pain before the development of the vesicles.  It will be interesting to see what kind of treatment can be developed to clear the mentioned regions of the virus, if it will take any current drugs or drugs being developed, such as the nasal spray being developed jointly by Canada and the UK, or if a different approach will be needed.",n435ys,2021-05-04 04:15:37

"**Abstract**


COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 pathogenesis causes vascular-mediated neurological disorders via still elusive mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a transmembrane receptor that recognizes the viral spike (S) protein. Brain pericytes were recently shown to express ACE2 at the neurovascular interface, outlining their possible implication in microvasculature injury in COVID-19. Yet, pericyte responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still to be fully elucidated. Using cell-based assays, we report that ACE2 expression in human brain vascular pericytes is highly dynamic and is increased upon S protein stimulation. Pericytes exposed to S protein underwent profound phenotypic changes translated by increased expression of contractile and myofibrogenic proteins, namely α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin, collagen I, and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein-3 (NOTCH3). These changes were associated to an altered intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamic. Furthermore, S protein induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative and nitrosative stress in pericytes as well as triggered an immune reaction translated by activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling pathway, which was potentiated by hypoxia, a condition associated to vascular comorbidities, which exacerbate COVID-19 pathogenesis. S protein exposure combined to hypoxia enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immune cell activation and trafficking, namely interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-18, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Finally, we found that S protein could reach the mouse brain via the intranasal route and that reactive ACE2-expressing pericytes are recruited to the damaged tissue undergoing fibrotic scarring in a mouse model of cerebral multifocal micro-occlusions, a main reported vascular-mediated neurological condition associated to COVID-19. Our data demonstrate that the released S protein is sufficient to mediate pericyte immunoreactivity, which may contribute to microvasculature injury in absence of a productive viral infection. Our study provides a better understanding for the possible mechanisms underlying cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19, paving the way to develop new therapeutic interventions.",n4hegl,2021-05-04 07:09:23

____  
(From discussion)  
It is important to note that although the study shows that I-S1 crosses the BBB in mice, this may not be the case in humans. For that reason, we used in vitro models of the human BBB, which can be useful in studying mechanisms of BBB permeability. The model used in this study is derived from human iPSCs and develops a brain endothelial cell-like phenotype that includes functional BBB influx and efflux transporters and strong barrier properties that permit the study of transport without confounding effects of high baseline leakage46,47. In this model, we did not observe significant differences in permeability for I-S1 compared to T-Alb. The apparent absence of I-S1 transport across the BBB in this in vitro model could be due to technical issues, such as blockers of I-S1 binding in the buffers. It could also mean that the iBECs did not express the cell-membrane glycoproteins necessary for I-S1 transport, or that I-S1 is not able to cross the human BBB. A note of caution regarding the validity of using monomeric S1 as a model for SARS-CoV-2 is that S1 is normally attached to SARS-CoV-2 as a trimer. However, the S1 protein may be shed from the virus in vivo, and therefore studying S1 monomers may have validity by itself—although there is currently no direct evidence that spike proteins are shed from SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that the S1 protein can cross the murine BBB through a mechanism resembling adsorptive transcytosis and be taken up by peripheral tissues independently of human ACE2.",n4hegl,2021-05-04 15:16:08

"**Abstract**

Unrelated individuals can produce genetically similar clones of antibodies, known as public clonotypes, which have been seen in responses to different infectious diseases as well as healthy individuals. Here we identify 37 public clonotypes in memory B cells from convalescent survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection or in plasmablasts from an individual after vaccination with mRNA-encoded spike protein. We identified 29 public clonotypes, including clones recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein S1 subunit (including a neutralizing, ACE2-blocking clone that protects in vivo), and others recognizing non-RBD epitopes that bound the heptad repeat 1 region of the S2 domain. Germline-revertant forms of some public clonotypes bound efficiently to spike protein, suggesting these common germline-encoded antibodies are preconfigured for avid recognition. Identification of large numbers of public clonotypes provides insight into the molecular basis of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and sheds light on the immune pressures driving the selection of common viral escape mutants.",n4hhp8,2021-05-04 14:04:08

"**Abstract**  

SARS-CoV-2 started spreading towards the end of 2019 causing COVID-19, a disease that reached pandemic proportions among the human population within months. The reasons for the spectrum of differences in the severity of the disease across the population, and in particular why the disease affects more severely the aging population and those with specific preconditions are unclear. **We developed machine learning models to mine 240,000 scientific papers openly accessible in the CORD-19 database, and constructed knowledge graphs to synthesize the extracted information and navigate the collective knowledge in an attempt to search for a potential common underlying reason for disease severity. The literature repeatedly pointed to elevated blood glucose as a key facilitator in the progression of COVID-19. Indeed, when we retraced the steps of the SARS-CoV-2 infection we found evidence linking elevated glucose to each step of the life-cycle of the virus, progression of the disease, and presentation of symptoms**. Specifically, elevations of glucose provide ideal conditions for the virus to evade and weaken the first level of the immune defense system in the lungs, gain access to deep alveolar cells, bind to the ACE2 receptor and enter the pulmonary cells, accelerate replication of the virus within cells increasing cell death and inducing an pulmonary inflammatory response, which overwhelms an already weakened innate immune system to trigger an avalanche of systemic infections, inflammation and cell damage, a cytokine storm and thrombotic events. We tested the feasibility of the hypothesis by analyzing data across papers, reconstructing atomistically the virus at the surface of the pulmonary airways, and performing quantitative computational modeling of the effects of glucose levels on the infection process. We conclude that elevation in glucose levels can facilitate the progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms and can explain much of the variance in disease severity seen across the population. The study proposes diagnostic recommendations, new areas of research and potential treatments, and cautions on treatment strategies and critical care conditions that induce elevations in blood glucose levels.",n3redl,2021-05-03 09:46:07

"**Abstract**


Patients with COVID-19 present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Thromboembolic events constitute a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Severe COVID-19 has been associated with hyperinflammation and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Platelets are important mediators and sensors of inflammation and are directly affected by cardiovascular stressors. In this report, we found that platelets from severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit higher basal levels of activation measured by P-selectin surface expression, and have a poor functional reserve upon in vitro stimulation. Correlating clinical features to the ability of plasma from COVID-19 patients to stimulate control platelets identified ferritin as a pivotal clinical marker associated with platelet hyperactivation. The COVID-19 plasma-mediated effect on control platelets was highest for patients that subsequently developed inpatient thrombotic events. Proteomic analysis of plasma from COVID-19 patients identified key mediators of inflammation and cardiovascular disease that positively correlated with in vitro platelet activation. Mechanistically, blocking the signaling of the FcγRIIa-Syk and C5a-C5aR pathways on platelets, using antibody-mediated neutralization, IgG depletion or the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, reversed this hyperactivity driven by COVID-19 plasma and prevented platelet aggregation in endothelial microfluidic chamber conditions, thus identifying these potentially actionable pathways as central for platelet activation and/or vascular complications in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, we reveal a key role of platelet-mediated immunothrombosis in COVID-19 and identify distinct, clinically relevant, targetable signaling pathways that mediate this effect. These studies have implications for the role of platelet hyperactivation in complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",n4h8sh,2021-05-04 06:59:45

"Abstract

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has gravely impacted societies around the world. Outbreaks in different parts of the globe have been shaped by repeated introductions of new viral lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State (USA) in early 2020 was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we observed evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we did not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient outcomes. Overall, this suggests that with regards to D614G, the behavior of individuals has been more important in shaping the course of the pandemic in Washington State than this variant of the virus.",n44f75,2021-05-03 20:05:30

"**Abstract**


Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging across the globe, continuing to threaten the efforts to end COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data indicate the prevalence of variants with N440K Spike substitution in several parts of India, which is under the second wave of the pandemic. Here, we first analyze the prevalence of N440K variants within the sequences submitted from India and identify a rising trend of its spread across various clusters. We then compare the replicative fitness and infectivity of a prototype of this variant with two other previously prevalent strains. The N440K variant produced ten times higher infectious viral titers than a prevalent A2a strain, and over 1000 folds higher titers than a much less prevalent A3i strain prototype in Caco2 cells. Similar results were detected in Calu-3 cells as well, confirming the increased potency of the N440K variant. Interestingly, A3i strain showed the highest viral RNA levels, but the lowest infectious titers in the culture supernatants, indicating the absence of correlation between the RNA content and the infectivity of the sample. N440K mutation has been reported in several viral sequences across India and based on our results, we predict that the higher infectious titers achieved by this strain could possibly lead to its higher rate of transmission. Availability of more sequencing data in the immediate future would help understand the potential spread of this variant in more detail.",n3zc1x,2021-05-03 16:43:59

"#Abstract

**Importance:** The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be a predictive correlate of protection for both natural infections and vaccinations. Identifying predictors of robust antibody responses is important to evaluate the risk of re-infection / vaccine failure and may be translatable to vaccine effectiveness.

**Objective:** To 1) determine the durability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in subjects who experienced mild and moderate to severe COVID-19, and 2) to evaluate the correlation of age and IgG responses to both endemic human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV-2 according to infection outcome.

**Design:** Longitudinal serum samples were collected from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive participants (U.S. active duty service members, dependents and military retirees, including a range of ages and demographics) who sought medical treatment at seven U.S. military hospitals from March 2020 to March 2021 and enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study.

**Results:** We observed SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in 100% of inpatients followed for six months (58/58) to one year (8/8), while we observed seroreversion in 5% (9/192) of outpatients six to ten months after symptom onset, and 18% (2/11) of outpatients followed for one year. Both outpatient and inpatient anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding-IgG responses had a half-life (T1/2) of >1000 days post-symptom onset. The magnitude of neutralizing antibodies (geometric mean titer, inpatients: 378 [246-580, 95% CI] versus outpatients: 83 [59-116, 95% CI]) and durability (inpatients: 65 [43-98, 95% CI] versus outpatients: 33 [26-40, 95% CI]) were associated with COVID-19 severity. Older age was a positive correlate with both higher IgG binding and neutralizing antibody levels when controlling for COVID-19 hospitalization status. We found no significant relationships between HCoV antibody responses and COVID-19 clinical outcomes, or the development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. 

**Conclusions and Relevance:** This study demonstrates that humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are robust on longer time-scales, including those arising from milder infections.",n3cnlo,2021-05-02 19:33:35

It’s a little early for peer-reviewed studies on this, given the length of time involved with even diagnosing what the CDC is calling PACS (Post-Acute Covid Syndrome), referred to by patients and most of the public as “long Covid.” But I have seen some news articles about breakthrough cases where some of the cases discussed involved symptoms that have continued for several weeks.

My concerns about this arise from the fact that many “long haulers” who have been suffering for many months had only mild or even asymptomatic acute cases. If mild or asymptomatic breakthrough cases can still result in long Covid, that would represent a significant public health danger, because of reduced vigilance on the part of those vaccinated. This seems like it would be an important area for researchers to be tracking right now.",n3u7r5,2021-05-04 19:49:54

It has just recently (in the last couple of days) come out that the covid vaccines can prevent one from becoming  infected with SARS-COV-2, and don't only prevent symptomatic COVID-19. 

That said, CDC Guidance allowing fully vaccinated folks to gather maskless, and the concept of vaccinated people skipping the mandated quarantine due to exposure, pre-dates the release of the information regarding the prevention of infection. As does the recording of the VAX LIVE concert that's airing tonight. How did those in the stadium know that they weren't speeding the virus asymptomatically and mutating it in the process. 

Why did they release this guidance if they thought it might be possible for people who are vaccinated to still spread the virus?",n3u7r5,2021-05-09 02:08:55

"This'll likely get buried coming so late in the week, but: **What does current research say about the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2?** I'd like to know whether there's actually a minimum time between exposure and spreading the virus, and what maximum times from exposure to symptoms we're currently observing with all the variants that are circulating. 

The CDC still says (at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html#Transmission) ""The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known with certainty. ... Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days."" 

It seems like someone must have data about the minimum and maximum times from a known exposure event to being contagious for SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but I don't know what to search to find recent papers with that data. The articles I've found about it quote the CDC as saying that someone can't be contagious within the first 48hrs of exposure, but the CDC's own claim is weaker than that and cites no relevant sources.

"Does it make sense to talk about herd immunity when you vaccinate **strictly** by descending age (ie 10 year ranges going down all the way to 18) and does it make sense as an efficient way of using vaccine doses available?

This is the strategy of some countries, but specifically i know of Portugal where the original plan from December 2020 was to vaccinate people 60+ by april-may and then open up vaccination to everyone (similar to what's happening in the US and other countries with more doses inoculated), then with new leadership (a navy man that's does not have any scientific expertise) in  the last month it was decided that the vaccination would be carried out strictly by age (while also vaccinating people with comorbidities of all ages as soon as possible), ALL THE WAY, ie 20 year olds won't start getting included possibly until september, not even getting vaccinated along with 30 year olds

In the current plan the health services claims it will achieve ""herd immunity levels"", ie 70%, somewhere between august and September.. my problem with this statement is that it would represent  nearly everyone in the 30+ year old demographic (so ~70% of the population) having the vaccine but everyone under it having very low levels (10% or so, roughly the  same as now) . The idea that this would confer anything like herd immunity seems a complete self evident absurdity. How can you contain spread when you have such a well defined segment of the population without any real widespread protection? People's social groups don't observe a random distribution in age, 20 year olds tend to hang out with other 20 year olds , and very few 40 or 50 year olds, so it just seem utterly absurd. 

It also seems, to me, highly inefficient as far as hampering/stopping the spread of the virus goes, for the same reasons along with the fact that younger people also tend to socialize more and with more ""new people"" , ie larger social groups, and so present a larger risk of spread were social restrictions to be dropped dramatically when you hit this ""herd immunity"" level

Would love someone with more expertise on this than me to give me some insights in case I'm wrong.

**Edit**: I dont know why i'm getting downvoted, primarily because the people doing it aren't giving any insights

There is evidence that younger people do drive transmission, which is fairly intuitive to begin with when you consider movement and how many people younger people interact with

>Thus, adults aged 20 to 49 continue to be the only age groups that contribute disproportionately to COVID-19 spread relative to their size in the population

And another one 

>https://www.touro.edu/news--events/stories/higher-rate-of-covid-19-in-teenagers-than-older-adults.php

My question is not whether we should do away with prioritization of older people, but whether there should be a threshold (60 or even 50) that when reached changes vaccination directives  to target everyone rather than prioritize the remaining population by age in a strict fashion, which seems much more efficient to me , though I am open to being corrected

How vaccines are distributed is also essential to whether you can get herd immunity (or mitigate spread) or not. This is not even an epidemiological question, you can get there with a decent understanding of statistics

That's why the variants are, well, surprisingly not that varied. The adaptations they all have in common are advantageous.

The endemic viruses are specifically adapting to maintain their ability to evade neutralizing antibodies, because at any one time they run into >70% seropositivity of the human population:

"Prior to vaccines, respiratory pandemics didn't go away, they became endemic, after waves of mortality associated with the buildup of partially protective immunity. Even after vaccines this happened, but with a more rapid transition due to vaccine immunity (the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics were blunted by vaccines in North America while causing noticeable disease burden in Europe and Asia).

Flu is also just different, especially flu 100 years ago. The *baseline* non-pandemic flu mortality in the early 20th century was an order of magnitude higher than it is now - about [150-200 per 100k in the US population](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/PH/PH709_Influenza/PH709_Influenza_print.html) which is similar to the rate of COVID-19 mortality in the US (bracketing from the beginning of the pandemic to today, it's been 170 per 100k).

"Can you link the specific studies you're reading? There have been a number of such studies posted here recently and the implications are typically positive - the long-term changes typically induced by infection are the recruitment of naive B- and T-cells into being antigen-specific long-lived cells.

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n24g64/sarscov2_sculpts_the_immune_system_to_induce/

COVID-19 has been shown to induce a sort of acute cellular 'exhaustion' in some cases, as well as T-cell depletion (lymphopenia). This exhaustion has been suspected as a cause of ""Long COVID"" via exhausted B-cells producing autoantibodies. In the medium term this also might increase their susceptibility to other pathogens though that hasn't been observed as far as I know (but it's hard to quantify since circulation of other viruses is essentially at an all-time low).

"That's just the longest interval they have hard trial data for.

However, immunologically, longer intervals are fine and common for other vaccines.

The original interval selected for the trial was the *shortest* that they believed would be practical, to speed the trial and mass vaccination. Not because it was ideal.

There was some fear that having large amounts of the population ""partially vaccinated"" would lead to a ""leaky vaccine"" that would accelerate vaccine resistant variants but that has not been observed. Partially vaccinated people are still far better from a viral evolution standpoint than unvaccinated.

"There isn't a lot of data on this, but from a mechanistic understanding, given the three leading hypotheses for causes of 'long COVID', vaccination should curb all of them at least as much as it curbs acute disease:

1. Autoimmune: the vaccines have been shown to mold the immune response in a more focused way and avoid the B-cell exhaustion common in infection that can lead to misfiring and autoantibody production. Even in previously infected people who already have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

2. Persistent infection: Obviously you can't have a persistent infection if you never have an infection, but also if an infection is slowed down and blocked from becoming systemic and potentially reaching immune-privileged regions such as the central nervous system.

3. Epigenetics, persistent changes to gene expression caused by spike proteins disseminating throughout the body via the bloodstream: [this article](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/05/04/spike-protein-behavior) explains why vaccines would be beneficial here beyond just preventing infection by making the spike protein a known target without themselves exposing the body to significant amounts.",n3u7r5,2021-05-04 20:58:25
"This is a common misconception because of the traditional view that drug trials should normally take years.

This isn't because they're literally waiting years for effects to appear, though.

""Six months"" is just the length of data from phase 3 trials (which began in the middle of last year) that was available to study. No reduction in effectiveness was seen within that span.

Keep in mind things are also moving more quickly now than they will next year, etc. These are just the first generation of vaccines; they are vastly more effective than expected, but there are improved ones in development regardless which will be more effective against current and future variants, be given as single doses, have lower side effects, etc. The virus itself will also slow down some as it infects fewer people.",n3u7r5,2021-05-04 18:25:14

This is not correct. Data in this regard has been coming out for a number of weeks. For example the CDC [published this at the end of March](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w), stating that medical professionals who were fully vaccinated were 90% less likely to have an asymptomatic infection, and 80% after one dose.

To be clear, it is still possible for them to spread, it's just unlikely enough that the risk is worth the benefits. The US is at the point where they need to use perks to convince the hesitant population to get vaccinated, the small risk that people can still spread afterwards is outweigh by the reduction in risk by convincing more people to get vaccinated.",n3u7r5,2021-05-09 16:03:15

Based on what we know about immunology, it's is quite possible that a prolonged interval between the first and second dose would lead to a stronger and more lasting immune memory than a shorter interval for the mRNA vaccines as well.

"60% of the Seychelles got their first dose 2 months ago; 65% as of one month ago. 1% of the population has tested positive within the last two weeks, well after that first dose should have started to matter.  It is a little weird, and different than what we saw in Israel or Chile.

But one difference is that the population is smaller.  Heterogeneity could explain it, if there's just one island or neighborhood that didn't get high enough vaccination levels.  A steady influx of sick tourists could also maybe be an explanation.

"Would we expect to see an association between vaccination and vascular damage this soon, especially if the effect is slow to manifest and largest in young people who were only able to receive vaccines within the last month in most places? 

Many patients who eventually develop Long Covid from viral infection never have a symptomatic infection, only showing symptoms many months after the virus has finished producing spike protein in the body. 

If Long Covid is occurring due to a small amount of spike protein generated during a mild infection that then induces long-term changes in genetic expression, why would we not expect to see Long Covid from vaccines that produce spike protein? 

Can we say what amount of spike protein is safe and what amount is unsafe?

"The effect described here isn't slow to manifest - it's being described as a putative cause for strokes and acute vascular damage during infection.

> If Long Covid is occurring due to a small amount of spike protein generated during a mild infection

It's not - one of the unanswered questions of ""Long COVID"" is the fact that most sufferers have no evidence of the infection remaining (no detectible viral antigens or RNA). If it was caused by viral spike proteins directly, then it would have to be due to persistent infection. Because again, these proteins can't just persist and self-replicate without a virus to generate them! The vaccines do not, can not, result in persistent generation. But also, Long COVID is not associated with strokes or vascular problems. It's primarily characterized by fatigue, 'brain fog', myalgia, anosmia.

Essentially the only known case of a protein acting in such a way is a prion disease, but the spike protein by itself is not capable of prion-like behavior.

An infection does not immediately produce symptoms; symptoms do not immediately turn into a reported case in the statistics they're tracking.

That's sort of a simplified way to put it to get people to understand why they need two within a certain timeframe.

The time to wait and see was last year while they were being developed and trialed - and to be fair most of us who answer questions in this thread were paying much closer attention than the general public during this phase, so when researchers announced they would seek approval, we were already assured that there was nothing further that we needed to wait and see because we had watched the process in action.

In early 2020 the mRNA research was already sort of in different phases, the vaccines we got were based on the mRNA theraputics that were already ready for prime time by February 2020, meanwhile they were already developing mRNA delivery technology that will be better at storage/transportation, better at immunogenicity (possibly allowing lower doses and lower side effects), etc.

There's also some more nitty-gritty stuff about antigen/epitope selection and design. The use of the S2P prefusion-stabilized whole spike has been an absolute success, but it's still worth trying a multivalent vaccine that encodes the nucleocapsid as well, and there might be more spike modifications that could be done to optimize the creation of neutralizing antibodies to specific epitopes that are the most conserved across variants and even related viruses like SARS-CoV-1 or emergent bat viruses.",n3u7r5,2021-05-06 16:21:17

Of course that's higher than either vaccine showed as its efficacy against symptomatic infection.  The vaccinated vs unvaccinated is a simplification, but homogeneity is simply a false assumption.

I guess what gives me pause is the study I linked, which found that cells treated with spike protein for 4 hours, and then given 48 hours to recover, still showed changes in genetic expression, indicating that the changes persist after the spike protein is gone. 

""After recovery, genes related to immune response retained changes in gene expression, and these may indicate relevant long-term effects in asymptomatic patients."" 

""Our survey included genes related to oxidative stress, hypoxia, osmotic stress, cell death, inflammatory response, DNA damage and unfolded protein response.

"Abstract

Background

The impact of statins on COVID-19 outcomes is important given the high prevalence of their use among individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. Our aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy is maintained during hospitalization.

Methods

This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization.

Results

After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54–0.83, p < 0.001); lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6–0.97, p = 0.025), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization.

Conclusions

Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn. In addition, statin therapy was associated with a decreased probability that patients with COVID-19 will develop AKI, ARDS, or sepsis and decreases the need for IMV.",n3ohtm,2021-05-03 06:13:02

"Highlights

Fluoxetine treatment elicits genetic changes which parallel those caused by IL6ST or NFKB1 knockdown.

Fluoxetine’s anti-inflammatory mechanism of action may depend upon NF-kappaB/IL6ST signaling.

The anti-inflammatory effects of fluoxetine are likely independent of its monoaminergic mechanism.

The anti-inflammatory effects of fluoxetine may prevent cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.

Abstract

Hyperinflammatory response caused by infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) increases organ failure, intensive care unit admission, and mortality. Cytokine storm in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) drives this pattern of poor clinical outcomes and is dependent upon the activity of the transcription factor complex nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and its downstream target gene interleukin 6 (IL6) which interacts with IL6 receptor (IL6R) and the IL6 signal transduction protein (IL6ST or gp130) to regulate intracellular inflammatory pathways. In this study, we compare transcriptomic signatures from a variety of drug-treated or genetically suppressed (i.e. knockdown) cell lines in order to identify a mechanism by which antidepressants such as fluoxetine demonstrate non-serotonergic, anti-inflammatory effects. Our results demonstrate a critical role for IL6ST and NF-kappaB Subunit 1 (NFKB1) in fluoxetine’s ability to act as a potential therapy for hyperinflammatory states such as asthma, sepsis, and COVID-19",n3o0eb,2021-05-03 05:40:38

"Abstract

Background: Recent epidemiological studies remain controversial regarding the association between statin use and reducing the risk of mortality among individuals with COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this study was to clarify the association between statin use and the risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19. 

Methods: We conducted a systematic articles search of online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science) between 1 February 2020 and 20 February 2021, with no restriction on language. The following search terms were used: “Statins” and “COVID-19 mortality or COVID19 mortality or SARS-CoV-2 related mortality”. Two authors individually examined all articles and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for study inclusion and exclusion. The overall risk ratio (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to show the strength of the association and the heterogeneity among the studies was presented Q and I2 statistic.

 Results: Twenty-eight studies were assessed for eligibility and 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Statin use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19 (RR adjusted = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.57–0.72, p < 0.001). Moreover, statin use both before and after the admission was associated with lowering the risk of mortality among the COVID-19 patients (RR adjusted;before = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56–0.84, p < 0.001 and RR adjusted;after = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.54–0.60, p < 0.001). 

Conclusion: This comprehensive study showed that statin use is associated with a decreased risk of mortality among individuals with COVID-19. A randomized control trial is needed to confirm and refute the association between them. ",n3oiu9,2021-05-03 06:15:05

"Abstract

The virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): a new virus with high infectivity and moderate mortality. The major clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the disease causes a potent systemic hyperin-flammatory response, i.e., a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is associated with thrombotic complications. The complexity of the disease requires appropriate intensive treatment. One of promising treatment is statin administration, these being 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies indicate that statin therapy is associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19, which may be caused by direct and indirect mechanisms. According to literature data, statins can limit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication by inhibiting the main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The cytokine storm can be ameliorated by lowering serum IL-6 levels; this can be achieved by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and modulating macrophage activity. Statins can also reduce the complications of COVID-19, such as thrombosis and pulmonary fibrosis, by reducing serum PAI-1 levels, attenuating TGF-β and VEGF in lung tissue, and improving endothelial function. Despite these benefits, statin therapy may have side effects that should be considered, such as elevated creatinine kinase (CK), liver enzyme and serum glucose levels, which are already elevated in severe COVID-19 infection. The present study analyzes the latest findings regarding the benefits and limitations of statin therapy in patients with COVID-19",n3ogqk,2021-05-03 06:10:58

"Highlights

•familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients are potentially at high risk for COVID-19 complications in the acute and chronic phases of the infection.

•

As statins are likely of benefit, FH patients with COVID-19 who use statins should continue with this therapy.

•

In FH patients, the focus should be on the effective lowering of high LDL-cholesterol levels, the root cause of the endothelial dysfunction

•

Epidemiologic data need to be gathered to confirm the expected increases in risk for, and severity of COVID-19 in FH patients.

Abstract

Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are likely at increased risk for COVID-19 complications in the acute phase of the infection, and for a long time thereafter. Because in FH patients the level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is elevated from birth and it correlates with the degree of systemic endothelial dysfunction, both heterozygous FH (HeFH) patients and, in particular, homozygous FH (HoFH) patients have a dysfunctional endothelium prone to further damage by the direct viral attack and the hyper-inflammatory reaction typical of severe COVID-19. Evidence to date shows the benefit of statin use in patients with COVID-19. In FH patients, the focus should therefore be on the effective lowering of LDL-C levels, the root cause of the expected excess vulnerability to COVID-19 infection in these patients. Moreover, the ongoing use of statins and other lipid-lowering therapies should be encouraged during the COVID pandemic to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19. For the reduction of the excess risk in FH patients with COVID-19, we advocate stringent adherence to the guideline determined LDL-C levels for FH patients, or maybe even to lower levels. Unfortunately, epidemiologic data are lacking on the severity of COVID-19 infections, as well as the number of acute cardiac events that have occurred in FH subjects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such data need to be urgently gathered to learn how much the risk for, and the severity of COVID-19 in FH are increased.",n3ofiy,2021-05-03 06:09:18

If one or multiple bat coronaviruses are capable of infecting humans and causing cross-immunity but doesn't cause symptoms/spread well *amongst* humans, it would explain why things never got out of control in places like Japan and South Korea, despite NPIs that were often less restrictive than the NPIs deployed in the rest of the world.",n36g6x,2021-05-02 20:25:56

It even reported prevalence of this factor for many areas of the world, including Africa. This was something other than the Neanderthal haplotype findings. It would absolutely make sense that if animals carrying coronaviruses are more prevalent in some areas and had been for thousands of years, there would have likely been repeated population exposure and greater chance of passing on useful genetic factors. We've had 2 such things happen in under 20 years both in Asia.

"Yeah, I don't think many conclusions can be drawn from Africa between the extremely low population age and the certain lack of sufficient testing/reporting.

The interesting cases are S Korea and Japan. They're wealthy enough that they do plenty of testing (enough to at least give an idea of the shape of things), free enough that the information couldn't be hidden, and old enough that they should be majorly impacted. And yet, even with NPIs that are less restrictive than much of the rest of the developed world, they have a small fraction of the cases and deaths. 

The reason I say genetics don't make a lot of sense to me is that I've seen analyses that show that people of Asian descent living outside of Asia are equivalently impacted by disease as their Caucasian countrymen. The big caveat to that is that I don't believe the analysis I've read has separated east Asia from the rest of the continent, which of course could be confounding (see India). It's an interesting area of study, and I really hope this will be looked at more and solved, because it's so clear to me that there has to be *something*.",n36g6x,2021-05-03 03:18:00

"I'm not sure how a community centered worldview makes a difference when actual NPIs differ so greatly.

For example, people often cite the greater willingness to wear masks in Asia as the difference between Japan/S Korea and the west. But even assuming that's true (and I doubt it is at things like private gatherings), restaurants have been open for most of the past year in those countries, which of course makes constant mask-wearing impossible.

So how is it that S Korea has 600+ cases per day (on fewer tests/capita than most of Europe and the US) and it never explodes there? We know that things like nightclubs are open and have patrons, even, because there have been outbreaks linked to them, but it's never gotten out of control. Contact tracing can't explain it, either. To my knowledge, Japan is doing next to nothing to trace, and S Korea has over a quarter of their cases in the past two weeks from unknown sources.

In my opinion the sample size is too low.  Only 1779 vaccinated individuals and 3 positive cases.  The CI is 30-95%.,n3d2vg,2021-05-03 14:22:18
">**Abstract**

>In light of the massive and rapid vaccination campaign against COVID-19, continuous real-world effectiveness and safety assessment of the FDA-authorized vaccines is critical to amplify transparency, build public trust, and ultimately improve overall health outcomes. In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We compared the infection rate of 2,195 individuals who received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals between February 27th and April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). **This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%)** in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%). Due to the recent authorization of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, there are not yet enough hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths within this cohort to robustly assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 severity, but these outcomes will be continually assessed in near-real-time with our platform. Collectively, this study provides further evidence that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reaffirms the urgent need to continue mass vaccination efforts globally.",n3d2vg,2021-05-02 19:53:29
Vaccine efficacy for detectable SARS-CoV-2 at 77% 14 days post vaccination is outstanding.  One dose Pfizer vaccine from Israel healthcare workers 14-28 days post first dose showed similar rests in terms of detectable SARS-CoV-2.  It would be good if they could followup to see at 28 days after vaccination (equivalent to 7 days after 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine) to see how good it is.,n3d2vg,2021-05-03 00:40:41
"These are great numbers. I might be wrong, so please if anyone can clarify, do so. Would this include asymptomatic infection? It never specifies and uses terms like ""tested positive."" If so, a nearly 77% effectiveness against all infection with just one dose is outstanding.",n3d2vg,2021-05-02 23:40:35
"I had a thought last night that perhaps somebody here could answer. Maybe or maybe not.  Idk.

I know they chose the ChAdOx1 adenovirus at least in part due to it’s extremely low seroprevalence in human population. Also, if I understand this correctly, this adenovirus has low immunogenicity and thus the immune system is slow to create immunity to it. Third, this family of adenovirus is extremely good at inducing cytotoxic T-Cell reactions with the human body reacting rather violently in terms of inflammation and other potential side effects?

But... how long does it take for humans to develop immunity to the viral vector? I imagined that either the dose was so low that this non-replicating viral vector hijacks a certain number of cells, and the immune system doesn’t encounter antigens from the ChAdOx1 vector, or maybe it does develop immunity over time.  I’m starting to think it takes awhile to develop immunity, but if you keep on giving yourself the vaccine, maybe the body would eventually recognize the vector? I’m thinking probably not from 3 doses over 4-months. 

I understand the human version of this adenovirus was tried unsuccessfully in creating an HIV vaccine. And of course it was successful for a couple other viruses that they were going to use it for, but ultimately, the cost was prohibitive and it was saved. I thought that they had also tried using them to deliver mostly gene therapy and failed potential cures for some diseases.

So, I was asked by someone, what would happen if they took 3 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in a four month window. My natural thought was to say that their bodies would quickly kill off either the adenovirus or the spikes would be neutralized within a few days. I realized that since the adenovirus creates a rather strong T-cell reaction, that cytokines would be produced in reasonable quantities that they might trigger an inflammatory response, etc. 

But then I stopped myself from saying that to the person. I wondered about immunity to viral vectors, potential damage to the liver and spleen(unlikely since the virus is non-replicating.) Would they develop other rare reactions? I know that it is almost certainly toxic at high does but how high? In all honesty, my thought was to tell the person that probably nothing would happen, and in fact, the person could potentially have some level of  neutralizing antibodies to spike proteins still present.  And that they might have another inflammatory reaction. 

I’m not quite 100% sure as I’m not an immunologist. I had heard that there were a fair number of adenoviruses they’ve discovered to be used as viral vectors and that, this is the first time it has been used on this scale. Before sars-cov-2, they had done some small scale experimentation, but despite the prevailing thoughts of these viruses as an old tried and true method, the adenovirus viral-vector type virus had only limited use, mostly failed, and is not in actuality a commonly used vaccine technology. I’m not aware of it’s use in any other commercially available vaccine.",n3d2vg,2021-05-03 19:00:14

Nutrition and other fat soluble vitamins for example, deliver directly to cells in a similar manner that the lipids in mRNA vaccines deliver them to cells?

I’m just saying that neither mRNA or ad viral-vectored vaccines are “old tried and tested” vaccines, so that claim doesn’t seem to stand in my opinion. Frankly ad viral-vectored vaccines seem slightly more complicated in terms of mechanism of action?",n3d2vg,2021-05-03 19:12:30

So if I understand it correctly, the non-stabilized spike vaccines illicit  a slightly different immune response from stabilized spike vaccines, making it imprudent to imply any efficacy of single-dose sputnik vaccine based on the efficacy of single-dose j&j vaccine.

"**Abstract**

Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students’ learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n ≈ 350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world’s highest rate of broadband access. **Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families.** Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. **The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.**",n367dc,2021-05-02 14:19:23

"The study addresses outcomes, which is good. The assumption as to causation is flawed. It may indeed be remote learning per se, although decades of good outcomes from home schooling makes that questionable. No consideration whatsoever to flawed teaching methodology.

"A lot of the fallout has yet to be seen imo.  Likely significant numbers of additional dropouts, and a weaker entering cohort of college students.",n367dc,2021-05-02 16:45:49
"This assumes that the only differences were remote vs in-class learning, and that there were no other external factors, such as living through a global pandemic, with parents being distracted and stressed from work and concerns about potential illness or family members being sick or hospitalized that could have also impacted the test scores. 

Secondly, why are we assuming that test scores are the only way to measure what children are learning?  I know that we love our metrics and things that we can easily measure, but there are different types of intelligence, learning, and skills that could have been gained while basic fact retention and rote memorization simultaneously decreased. 

Do we have any studies measuring whether children have gained perseverance or grit during challenging times?  Children are resilient, and they have many years left of life to make up for a year of educational disruption, considering that their generation could have an average life span of close to 90-100?

In many developed nations where this is of great concern, there has been genuine concern and discourse related to recent generations becoming entitled and losing the perspective of struggle and grit that prior generations living through much more difficult times had developed.",n367dc,2021-05-02 22:04:16

"The methodology isn't looking out outcomes only, it is leveraging a natural experiment based on the dates of standardized testing to compare with the counterfactual based on learning outcomes from previous years. The teachers from year to year don't change dramatically but the mode of instruction did. One could argue that this is caused by some other factor like increased anxiety although they control for this by using fixed effects, but I don't think it's a stretch to say schools closing has a causal effect on learning outcomes.

Here is the relevant methodological section: 

>Key to our study design is the fact that national assessments take place twice a year in The Netherlands ([40](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2022376118#ref-40)): halfway into the school year in January to February and at the end of the school year in June. In 2020, these testing dates occurred just before and after the first nationwide school closures that lasted 8 wk starting March 16 ([Fig. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2022376118#F1)). Access to data from 3 y prior to the pandemic allows us to create a natural benchmark against which to assess learning loss. We do so using a difference-in-differences design ([SI Appendix, section 4.2](https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2022376118/-/DCSupplemental)) and address loss to follow-up using various techniques: regression adjustment, rebalancing on propensity scores and maximum-entropy weights, and fixed-effects designs that compare students within the same schools and families.",n367dc,2021-05-02 19:26:17
"There’s a huge difference in the situation of families who choose to homeschool, and families who were basically forced into it with no warning one day-often families with no stay at home parent to homeschool. The assumption that research on homeschooling outcomes in a normal situation are generalizable to a pandemic is highly flawed.",n367dc,2021-05-03 00:30:59
">This assumes that the only differences were remote vs in-class learning, and that there were no other external factors, such as living through a global pandemic, with parents being distracted and stressed from work and concerns about potential illness or family members being sick or hospitalized that could have also impacted the test scores. 

This is true, but it is mediated somewhat by using in family fixed effects. Future research will have to look at diff-in-diff results between states that didn't close school during the 2020-21 school year and those that did. I think these results are robust enough to suggest that areas with widespread school closures will have detrimental results on children's learning outcomes.
 

>Do we have any studies measuring whether children have gained perseverance or grit during challenging times?  Children are resilient, and they have many years left of life to make up for a year of educational disruption, considering that their generation could have an average life span of close to 90-100?

[Grit as a concept is highly criticized.](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000102) [Scholars have also pointed out that resilience and grit are cultivated through interactions with adults who positively influence them.](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-018-0242-3) It doesn't just happen from facing adversity. Lastly, I sincerely don't understand where the narrative that ""kids are resilient"" has come from. We know that early childhood trauma can lead to long term negative effects, and environmental factors during the development stages of life can harm outcomes.

>In many developed nations where this is of great concern, there has been genuine concern and discourse related to recent generations becoming entitled and losing the perspective of struggle and grit that prior generations living through much more difficult times had developed.

There are many, many, kids in the public school system who face ""struggle"" and live through difficult times.  [17% of children live in poverty in the US](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/43-children-in-poverty-100-percent-poverty#detailed/1/any/false/1729,37,871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133/any/321,322). One of the goals of public education is to smooth out these differences. While kids in the top 20% of the population with parents working from home may gain some perspective of struggle, millions of kids did not need this since they already are suffering.",n367dc,2021-05-03 06:36:21

"The mode of instruction (remove v. in-person) requires different behaviors by teachers to be effective. The problem I opine is not the mode, but the implementation.

Teaching remotely is well established with proven best practices. Home schooling has driven a lot of that because not all parents can manage all subjects. Lots of training has been remote for over twenty years. You just have to look. School districts have uniformly failed by trying to use classroom techniques remotely and concluding the problem is remote learning when in fact the problem was methodology.,n367dc,2021-05-03 16:47:09
"If this virtual learning that was forced in an acute scenario had lasted for years, we may find many long-term effects, but for some regions, children were virtual for 6 weeks before schools reopened, while some may have been for 6 months. 

To compare six months of disrupted education to childhood trauma such as abuse for the majority of children is a bit of a stretch. 

Are there some children already at risk or living in poverty that were definitely negatively impacted?  Absolutely?  Well that lead to lifelong losses or disadvantages?  That is really much harder to say. 

With all of the resources, technology, and free information available to us now compared to the past, there are opportunities for children to catch up, or to make up for lost time. There have been children that have had to repeat grades or do summer school for many years, so again, it’s going to be difficult to differentiate the long-term impacts a decade or more from now. 

Additionally there are some children, even those in poverty, who have done better with virtual learning due to social and/or learning issues such as bullying, ADD (some kids that that an easier time focusing at home with no distractions versus in a classroom), anxiety, etc. Many school districts are including an option for continued virtual/remote learning for the upcoming school year.",n367dc,2021-05-03 14:35:19

"I am not really understanding your criticism. This paper is evaluating public policy which closed schools, which lead to decreased learning outcomes. They convincingly isolated this causality. Your statement that the causal mechanism is poor teaching isn't at odds with this because it's not testing generalized distance learning versus in person learning.",n367dc,2021-05-02 20:03:44
"> The mode of instruction (remove v. in-person) requires different behaviors by teachers to be effective.

So the problem is not that we closed schools, but that we closed schools without also spending the previous decade retraining teachers to be ready for it.",n367dc,2021-05-03 16:26:43
"There are some US public schools that remain closed, and they're more likely to be in urban areas where achievement was already low.

The point is not to compare the magnitude of different traumas but to push back on the ""kids are resilient"" handwave argument. Resilience has its limits, and we're learning what those limits are.",n367dc,2021-05-03 15:49:28

It wouldn't have taken a decade. It's the sort of thing that in-service training could easily have covered for 90% of teachers. Instead we spent the time banging back and forth between open and closed and arguing about boundary conditions. Best practice methodology for remote learning is well established. Almost all school districts didn't bother to understand what we already know.,n367dc,2021-05-03 16:42:46
"It was not intended to be a hand waving argument, but rather, an actual assessment that children tend to be more open-minded, agile, able to deal with challenges/adversity, and less dogmatic than adults. 

I acknowledged that there are absolutely a segment of kids at risk that we should be concerned about, but the concerns with data like this is that it’s often extrapolated to apply to all children. There was serious discussion in many regions/school districts since the beginning about keeping schools safely open for children at highest/greatest risk, but that involves investments in costs to do so safely, like less children per classroom, advanced HVAC systems and/or filtration, etc. 

Often the poorest schools have the highest number of children per classroom and per teacher, which is not ideal for reducing transmission.",n367dc,2021-05-03 16:09:47

"Can someone who understands the terminology tell me if I just read ""Covid caused a miscarriage""?",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 00:55:46
"If I understood correctly, here’s the gist.  
A mother had an ultrasound to confirm pregnancy at a little over 7 weeks.  Around 8 weeks, she came in contact with a COVID positive person and was tested herself afterwards.  She was positive.  She was quarantined until 10 weeks when she started testing negative.  At 13 weeks she got another ultrasound and their was no heartbeat.

At this point it sounds like they tested her again, along with the samples they were able to recover and test from this pregnancy.  She was negative still, but the placenta showed both COVID infection, and signs of inflammation due to high leukocytes / white blood cells.  They tested the amniotic sac membrane and fluid as well, also positive.  They did not have or test any fetal tissue.  

It appears this fetus was likely infected with COVID, and died while infected, while the mother no longer was. 

The mother also lost her last pregnancy to a similar first trimester spontaneous abortion, but in the testing they did rule out several things that might ordinarily cause that to happen.",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 04:17:45
"I thought there were other cases of this exact thing. I think there were two other papers about it on this sub but that was pretty early on. Edit: No. No miscarriage, just evidence of placenta damage. [https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/05/placentas-from-covid-19-positive-pregnant-women-show-injury/&fj=1](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/05/placentas-from-covid-19-positive-pregnant-women-show-injury/&fj=1)",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 04:35:00
"> This is the first study to provide concrete evidence of persistent placental infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its congenital transmission is associated with hydrops fetalis and intrauterine **fetal demise in early pregnancy.**

That would indicate that, yes, SARS-CoV-2 ~~caused~~was associated with a miscarriage in this case",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 01:13:36
"Can't say for sure if it was a cause but it was definitely something to make note of, and was likely a contributing factor",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 06:58:13
"I think the big thing missing from your assessment is that the fetus was shown to have hydrops fetalis and most other causes were ruled out.

Hydrops fetalis is known to be caused by immune response to viruses but SARS-2-CoV has not yet been implicated.",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 13:08:45
">  The mother also lost her last pregnancy to a similar first trimester spontaneous abortion

Doesn't really seem the best candidate for an associational study on Covid. I get that they ""ruled out several things that might that might ordinarily cause that to happen"", but still.

Since there have been other cases of pregnancy with evidences of placental damage (as linked below) without miscarriage, could it be that the miscarriage was due to preexisting causes (genetic maybe? or anyway really hard to study) and not directly due to Covid?",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 10:45:39

“Associated with” does not mean “caused by.”,n2tx5e,2021-05-02 02:25:12
That's just plainly not true. Did you read the study? It is almost certainly the cause.,n2tx5e,2021-05-02 13:06:16
Having one miscarriage doesn’t really increase your chances of having another one. Extremely common. Many people also miscarry before they even knew they were pregnant and never realized they miscarried.,n2tx5e,2021-05-02 11:11:02
"There was a miscarriage, and there was SARS-CoV-2 which had transmitted to the fetus. However it's important to note that this could be coincidental as there are a *lot* of things that cause miscarriage. Also a lot of potential *yes, but* possibilities like even if it was Covid as the proximate cause it only was able to happen because of a genetic or environmental difference not usually seen.",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 04:23:07

"True, but can the reasons for natural abortions ever be ascertained with much certainty?",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 03:53:37
Having a miscarriage doesn’t necessarily *increase* the risk of having another one but some women are more likely to have miscarriages to begin with. It can run in families.,n2tx5e,2021-05-02 11:26:56
That’s precisely what I mean. The commenter originally said COVID caused the miscarriage. They don’t have evidence to say that with any amount of certainty.,n2tx5e,2021-05-02 04:09:09
For sure. But isn’t that what they attempted to rule out?,n2tx5e,2021-05-02 11:27:46
Easier said than done. There are a lot of factors at play and trying to pin down the reason for an early miscarriage is nearly impossible unless there’s an obvious genetic anomaly.,n2tx5e,2021-05-02 11:35:58
"Of course. I agree. I guess my point was is that if you’re going to rule out everyone that’s had a miscarriage or may have had a miscarriage from covid-pregnancy data, you’re going to be left with a much smaller part of the population that’s not representative of the general population.",n2tx5e,2021-05-02 11:37:58

### Background & Aims

Given  that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a prominent extrapulmonary  manifestation of COVID-19, we investigated intestinal infection with  SARS-CoV-2, its effect on pathogenesis, and clinical significance.

### Methods

Human  intestinal biopsy tissues were obtained from patients with COVID-19  (n =19) and uninfected control individuals (n = 10) for microscopic  examination, cytometry by time of flight analyses, and RNA sequencing.  Additionally, disease severity and mortality were examined in patients  with and without GI symptoms in 2 large, independent cohorts of  hospitalized patients in the United States (n = 634) and Europe (n =  287) using multivariate logistic regressions.

### Results

COVID-19  case patients and control individuals in the biopsy cohort were  comparable for age, sex, rates of hospitalization, and relevant comorbid  conditions. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in small intestinal epithelial  cells by immunofluorescence staining or electron microscopy in 14 of 16  patients studied. High-dimensional analyses of GI tissues showed low  levels of inflammation, including down-regulation of key inflammatory  genes including *IFNG*, *CXCL8*, *CXCL2*, and *IL1B*  and reduced frequencies of proinflammatory dendritic cells compared  with control individuals. Consistent with these findings, we found a  significant reduction in disease severity and mortality in patients  presenting with GI symptoms that was independent of sex, age, and  comorbid illnesses and despite similar nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral  loads. Furthermore, there was reduced levels of key inflammatory  proteins in circulation in patients with GI symptoms.

### Conclusions

These  data highlight the absence of a proinflammatory response in the GI  tract despite detection of SARS-CoV-2. In parallel, reduced mortality in  patients with COVID-19 presenting with GI symptoms was observed. A  potential role of the GI tract in attenuating SARS-CoV-2–associated  inflammation needs to be further examined.",n2mv5v,2021-05-01 18:22:55

"The data here illuminate as subject I have only seen discussed openly with reference to precautions against the 1918 influenza pandemic, although it might possibly be behind the advice to UK shoppers in supermarkets to shop alone - the influence of talking on aerosol generation.

The first sub-table in Table 1 shows the amount of aerosol generation as a multiple of aerosol generated during quiet breathing: this starts at 34.6 for talking, with shouting at 163.6 and coughing at 370.8. These figures are repeated in the summary ""When compared with quiet breathing, exertional respiratory activities increased particle counts 34.6‐fold during talking and 370.8‐fold during coughing (p < 0.001). "" The caption on figure S-2 (supplementary information) is ""Total volumes of particles generated by six different activities by each
subject. Subjects are described by sex (male/female) and height (cm). Two subjects
were male and 177 cm in height. Volumes estimated using a simple model applied to
the six size-bins of particle counts 0.5 to 25 μm. Quiet breathing contributes < 0.2% of
total volume on average and is barely discernible.""

For comparison, the reduction due to facemasks for these activities is shown as a box plot in figure S-1 and numerically in the last section marked Table 1. The best result is a 5-fold reduction, for coughing. The reduction for quiet breathing is not statistically significant (perhaps not surprising, since under the circumstances of quiet breathing, they find that aerosol production is barely discernible).

If these figures can be replicated, it seems to me that they should be considered in this or future pandemics (since they count only aerosol production they are not specific to covid). Where we are placing constraints on people (and spending political capital to do this) I think we should be doing so as efficiently as possible.",n2rr8n,2021-05-02 06:07:52

"**Abstract**

ABSTRACT Background Immunization against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of immunizations on the mortality of individuals aged 80+ years. Methods By April 22, 2021, 147,454 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 80+ and 90+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated, and mortality rate ratios compared these two age groups with individuals aged 0-79 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health vaccination monitoring website. All results were tabulated by two-week periods from epidemiological weeks 1-14, 2021. Findings As the P.1 variant spread throughout Brazil, the total number of deaths increased over time starting in epidemiological week 9 of 2021. The proportion of all deaths occurring at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 13.1% in weeks 13-14. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-79 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 6.9 times in weeks 13-14. Coronavac accounted for 77.3% and AstraZeneca for 15.9% of all doses administered. Vaccination coverage (first dose) increased rapidly among individuals aged 80+ years, reaching 49.1% in weeks 5-6 and over 90% after week 9. Interpretation Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with an important decline in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the P.1 variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 13,824 deaths would have been expected up to week 14.",n2pd3w,2021-05-01 20:23:48

"**Abstract**


SARS-CoV-2 infection induces virus-reactive memory B cells expressing unmutated antibodies, which hints at their emergence from naïve B cells. Yet, the dynamics of virus-specific naïve B cells and their impact on immunity and immunopathology remain unclear. Here, we longitudinally studied moderate to severe COVID-19 patients to dissect SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell responses overtime. We found a broad virus-specific antibody response during acute infection, which evolved into an IgG1-dominated response during convalescence. Acute infection was associated with increased mature B cell progenitors in the circulation and the unexpected expansion of virus-targeting naïve-like B cells that further augmented during convalescence together with virus-specific memory B cells. In addition to a transitory increase in tissue-homing CXCR3+ plasmablasts and extrafollicular memory B cells, most COVID-19 patients showed persistent activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells along with transient or long-lasting changes of key innate immune cells. Remarkably, virus-specific antibodies and the frequency of naïve B cells were among the major variables defining distinct immune signatures associated with disease severity and inflammation. Aside from providing new insights into the complexity of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, our findings indicate that the de novo recruitment of mature B cell precursors into the periphery may be central to the induction of antiviral immunity.",n24g64,2021-04-30 22:57:33

"I think what it is saying is that the virus causes a unique response in a persons immune system such that we see a larger proportion of naive B cells with persistently activated cd4 and cd8 T cells. What it means overall is not as clear, to me atleast, but it could help in improving how we develop vaccines and treatments to provide longer, lasting treatments without having to get boosters overtime.",n24g64,2021-05-01 05:50:39

"I'm having a mildly hard time to entangle it, but to me it reads like ""virus-specific"" but not ""variant-specific"", so a sustained SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity, however across variants.

"Yeah, the severity finding is hard to untangle. I think they found that the further a patients immune population drifted from healthy controls the more severe the disease. I don't think that would be surprising as a more involved immune response would like correlate with severity. What they found surprising was that naive B cell population correlated with severity as well when you might have otherwise expected more memory b cells during the course of infection. Not positive on that part.

I think the possible takeaway from that finding is that having a lot of naive b cells floating around can cause a more severe immune response/course of disease.",n24g64,2021-05-01 17:15:34

> the immune system may be evolutionary programmed to recruit mature B cell precursors from the bone marrow into the periphery as a “last-ditch” defense against invading virions

It sounds like it is characteristic of an aggressive immune response. This would make sense with the fact that some of the treatments like steroids aim to suppress immune responses.",n24g64,2021-05-01 18:06:05

"I always like to point out that on November 9, 2020, when Pfizer announced it had a working vaccine, the US was at 225,352 COVID deaths (according to Wikipedia). According to the same source, we’re now at 544,502. So over 300,000 Americans, more than half of the total dead, have died *after* a vaccine was announced. Obviously it’s difficult to run the counterfactual here and pandemic fatigue may have set in anyway, but it’s not clear to me that vaccines have even saved lives on net so far since they so drastically discouraged the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions in many places.",n24917,2021-05-02 04:44:23
"I am not convinced by your hypothesis. A lot of places managed to get their outbreak under control even after vaccines were announced and they were experiencing another wave. Look at the UK, Portugal or Spain where cases declined substantially before any meaningful impact of vaccines could have occured.",n24917,2021-05-02 10:08:33
"I don't think the data bear out your assertion. The vaccine rollout has corresponded with a dramatic fall in the numbers of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. Either this is directly as a result of the vaccine, in which case the vaccine clearly has saved lives. Or it is not a result of the vaccine, in which case the vaccine announcement is not correlated with an increase, but rather a decrease in overall numbers, whatever the cause of the decrease.

I also think you can't claim that the surge in December was due to a vaccine announcement. That is also a case of correlation that easily might not be causation. The surge was already under way before the announcements, and then December was post Thanksgiving and Christmas There are surges in the data directly linked to those holidays. It is not clear to me that a vaccine announcement or no vaccine announcement would have made much difference in the amount of spread. FWIW: In my circles I never witnessed relaxation in social distancing measures post-announcement but pre-vaccination. On the contrary, people in my circles became hyper-vigilant until they could get vaccinated. Obviously that is an anecdote and not data.

Finally, I would pose an opposite thought experiment. Had there been no promise of a vaccine, I think it quite likely the social distancing measures would have been far less effective than they were. People could tolerate the measures if they saw a light at the end of tunnel. But if there had been no light at the end of the tunnel, there is no reason to think that social distancing might not have been less that it was, especially among younger low-risk groups. I don't see any evidence that makes my thought experiment any less likely than yours.",n24917,2021-05-02 16:05:28
"Oh so people died before getting vaccinated but after the vaccine was announced, therefore the vaccine didn't save many lives. Real solid hypothesis.",n24917,2021-05-02 12:45:06
"I’m a bit confused by what you’re saying; if “cases declined substantially before any meaningful impact of vaccines could have occured,” aren’t you saying that vaccines weren’t the main factor in cases going down and therefore didn’t save very many lives? (Obviously one would think that vaccines would, at the very least, help these countries loosen restrictions without cases spiking again.)",n24917,2021-05-02 10:21:06
"If I understood your initial argument correctly, you are saying that because of relaxed social distancing measures vaccines in the US lead to more deaths (at least initially. I don't think there is a point arguing that the long-term benefits are clearly positive). Now I pointed out that several countries managed to suppress their outbreaks after the announcement of vaccines but before any meaningful impact of vaccines could be measured. Thus, the mere announcement of vaccines does not automatically lead to the breakdown of non-pharmaceutical interventions and thus not necessarily causes more deaths.",n24917,2021-05-02 10:32:21
"I’m wondering what the net effect so far has been across all countries (not e.g. what could have happened if country A acted more like country B). If a country was going to largely suppress COVID transmission anyway without vaccines, then the (initial) effect of vaccines there on total deaths was largely neutral. So then all it would take is one country where the effect so far has been largely negative (e.g. if the US would’ve had ~200k deaths in the last six months without vaccines vs. ~300k with them) for the total effect across all countries to have been negative.",n24917,2021-05-02 10:42:28

What I do know is that there has never been a more pressing need for more science specialists who are also trained in crafting plain-language summaries of research like this.

Additionally, while I know that representative sampling can tell us a great deal and can be conducted rigorously, I am not sure how to take the broad applicability of a study that is based on blood testing of only 51 people in a very specific and infection-risk-heightened line of work -- none of whom, if I'm reading this correctly, actually got infected over the course of the period surveyed (""at 42 weeks none of the previously uninfected HCW had become seropositive"").",n1wk7n,2021-04-30 23:07:10

"### Findings

Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2  \[SD 5·59\]),

* 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 
* 1601 (0·02%) to  an ICU, and 
* 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. 

We  found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to  COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio \[HR\] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2  of 1·05 \[95% CI 1·05–1·05\]) and death (1·04 \[1·04–1·05\]), and 

a linear  association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10  \[1·09–1·10\]). 

We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and  ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 \[95% CI 1·08–1·10\] in 20–39 years age group *vs* 80–100 years group 1·01 \[1·00–1·02\]) and Black people than White people (1·07 \[1·06–1·08\] *vs*  1·04 \[1·04–1·05\]). 

The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to  COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in  people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease  than in those without these morbidities.",n1oydq,2021-04-30 13:01:51
"* Figure 1A (admission to hospital) has a minimum hazard ratio at a BMI of about 23 kg/m^2 (normal weight). 

* Figure 1B (admission to ICU) does not show a clear minimum, for some reason the error bars are huge below 22 kg/m^2, but it seems to be monotonically increasing with BMI. This seems to suggest a very small sample size of people with below-average weight who get sent to the ICU.

* Figure 1C (death) shows a minimum hazard ratio at about 26 kg/m^2 (slightly overweight), with substantially increased risk on both sides.

It would seem that, for a patient who is underweight or low-normal weight, the odds of ending up in the ICU are very low, but the odds of dying are relatively high.

"Table 2 shows that the hazard ratio from BMI itself is very small, 1.05 / BMI, whereas it's type 2 diabetes that's where the hazard ratio explodes (5.09/BMI for the unadjusted data).

Whereas an individual with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that has progressed into type 2 diabetes at the same 25+5=30 BMI has something like 2500 % increased risk of death. To put that in perspective the risk of dying from cancer for smokers is only about 400 % higher than non-smokers. 

There's a number of confounding factors as people who develop type 2 diabetes typically don't take good care of themselves and have other comorbidities, which is what all the other tabs in Table 2 are trying to distinguish, but that goes to show you just how much outcome depends on lifestyle choice.",n1oydq,2021-04-30 16:48:27

"> 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital 

Is this saying that 0.2% of covid cases resulted in hospitalization? That's much lower than other numbers I've seen",n1oydq,2021-04-30 14:40:19
"You have to remember that these graphs in Figure 1 are showing predominately elderly people. If you look in Table 1 you can see that those >= 80 years old were only 6.2 % of the study population but 34.6 % of the hospitalizations, yet only 6.5 % of the ICU admissions, but  then 57.3 % of the deaths. If you then look at Figure 1 (b) this ""J-shaped"" curve is not present, and that's because the elderly are being given essentially hospice care instead of ICU care.

When the elderly lose weight, it's typically not fat, it's lean body mass. And losing lean body mass as you age is very, very bad. It's a sign that, not just muscle, but internal organs are shrinking. As people age their metabolism shuts down and that begins the long decline that eventually results in death from natural causes.

Given the extreme relative risk that is age, I would have liked to see Figure 1 replicated separately for each age cohort in the supplemental information. I think it would show a very different story. The author's claim they adjusted for age, but given the lack of ICU admissions for 80+ and the fact that curve isn't J-shaped like the other two, I don't think their adjustments were successful.",n1oydq,2021-04-30 16:38:27
I am guessing ex smokers would trend older.,n1oydq,2021-05-01 18:26:17
"I wouldn't say so.

The best BMI for not even getting to the hospital is about a ""normal"" 23, while the best BMI to get admitted into a hospital, and then go through ICU... but then *survive* the ordeal is a ""slightly overweight"" 26. It's certainly better not to get hospitalised in the first place, so the degree that this study gives you a strategy, 23, about in the middle of the ""normal"" range for a white person, would be a good BMI to shoot for.

The explanation is that, probably, if you end up into ICU, having some spare fat can help you survive it. Another explanation is that, among the elderly, who are most likely to die from COVID, not being slightly overweight is a sign of being otherwise relatively frail. 

All in all, it seems that the ideal weight is around the upper end of ""normal"", but I would not jump from correlation to causation so fast.",n1oydq,2021-04-30 14:38:07
"That was my first reaction as well, but there are some complications to worry about:

1) Not everybody at a low BMI is there e.g. because they are a hill-climbing cyclist. Some are there from a medical condition that limits how much they can eat. Some might be sacrificing all semblance of healthy nutrition to a goal BMI.

2) Being good at surviving acute infection is not the same as aging well or even coping with everyday life well.

"Its a little more complicated that that, but the overall interpretation (note that I did not go through the entire study) from the authors is that increasing BMI increased risk of more severe outcomes.

The authors also mention that there was a significant interaction with age and ethnicity and I don't see that graphed anywhere. For the older age groups (60-79 and 80+) BMI does not predict outcomes as well so they could be skewing the data in Figure 1.

The HR was highest in the youngest age groups and decreased  progressively with increasing age becoming non-significant in the 80  years and older age group for death. Among people aged 20–39 years, each  BMI unit increase above 23 kg/m2 was associated with  increased risk of hospital admission (HR 1·09 \[95% CI 1·08–1·10\]), ICU  admission (1·13 \[1·11–1·16\]), and death due to COVID-19 (1·17  \[1·11–1·23; [figure 2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(21)00089-9/fulltext#fig2)).  The incidence of severe COVID-19 increased with age, therefore the  attributable risks were generally higher in people aged 40–59 and 60–69  years but attributable fractions were higher in those aged 20–39 years ([appendix p 7](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(21)00089-9/fulltext#sec1)).

The discussion also paints the slightly more nuanced picture shown in figure 1 so I'm not sure why they didn't use this for their opening interpretation.

>We found a significant positive linear association between increasing  BMI and admission to ICU due to COVID-19, with significantly higher risk  for every BMI unit increase. We found J-shaped associations between  increasing BMI and hospital admission or death due to COVID-19, with  increased risks for people with a BMI of 20 kg/m2 or less and approximately linear increases in risk for people with a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2 for admission to hospital, but the risk of death increased only in people with a BMI of more than 28 kg/m2.

A major outbreak of PAH occurred in 1965 and was associated with aminorex, a weight-loss stimulating drug \[[**39**](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/1/36/htm#B39-vaccines-09-00036),[**40**](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/1/36/htm#B40-vaccines-09-00036)\]. Approximately 0.2% of people who took this drug developed PAH \[[**40**](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/1/36/htm#B40-vaccines-09-00036)\]. An epidemic was observed two years after the introduction of aminorex, and half of the patients died 10 years after the epidemic \[[**39**](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/1/36/htm#B39-vaccines-09-00036)\].

Those cases all seem to involve long-term exposure to the toxin or drug, like with fenfluramine:

>The median duration of fenfluramine exposure was 6 months, with a median of 4.5 yrs between exposure and onset of symptoms.

([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17959632](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17959632/))

Chronic, daily exposure to dozen(s) of mg/day of a drug seems very different to a short-term exposure to a protein via a vaccine that elicits a strong neutralizing immune response. Any idea why the authors of that paper consider it relevant?

What happens to spike protein from the vaccine that is bound to receptors? Would it be cleared by the immune response, or remain in place and keep activating the receptor ?

>Maybe we simply haven't waited long enough.

"Abstract

Importance  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia, a rare and serious condition, has been described in Europe following receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca), which uses a chimpanzee adenoviral vector. A mechanism similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been proposed. In the US, the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), which uses a human adenoviral vector, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on February 27, 2021. By April 12, 2021, approximately 7 million Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses had been given in the US, and 6 cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia had been identified among the recipients, resulting in a temporary national pause in vaccination with this product on April 13, 2021.

Objective  

To describe reports of CVST with thrombocytopenia following Ad26.COV2.S vaccine receipt.

Design, Setting, and Participants  

Case series of 12 US patients with CVST and thrombocytopenia following use of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under EUA reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from March 2 to April 21, 2021 (with follow-up reported through April 21, 2021).

Exposures  

Receipt of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Clinical course, imaging, laboratory tests, and outcomes after CVST diagnosis obtained from VAERS reports, medical record review, and discussion with clinicians.

Results  

Patients’ ages ranged from 18 to younger than 60 years; all were White women, reported from 11 states. Seven patients had at least 1 CVST risk factor, including obesity (n = 6), hypothyroidism (n = 1), and oral contraceptive use (n = 1); none had documented prior heparin exposure. Time from Ad26.COV2.S vaccination to symptom onset ranged from 6 to 15 days. Eleven patients initially presented with headache; 1 patient initially presented with back pain and later developed headache. Of the 12 patients with CVST, 7 also had intracerebral hemorrhage; 8 had non-CVST thromboses. After diagnosis of CVST, 6 patients initially received heparin treatment. Platelet nadir ranged from 9 ×103/µL to 127 ×103/µL. All 11 patients tested for the heparin-platelet factor 4 HIT antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening had positive results. All patients were hospitalized (10 in an intensive care unit [ICU]). As of April 21, 2021, outcomes were death (n = 3), continued ICU care (n = 3), continued non-ICU hospitalization (n = 2), and discharged home (n = 4).

Conclusions and Relevance  

The initial 12 US cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination represent serious events. This case series may inform clinical guidance as Ad26.COV2.S vaccination resumes in the US as well as investigations into the potential relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and CVST with thrombocytopenia.",n1xidk,2021-04-30 17:28:29

"## Abstract

Background: COVID-19 is a major worldwide health problem because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality. Several lines of evidence have suggested a relationship between the vitamin D endocrine system and severity of COVID-19. Methods: We present a retrospective survival study that includes all Andalusian patients hospitalized between January and November 2020 because of COVID-19 infection. Based on a central registry of electronic health records (the Andalusian Population Health Database, BPS), prescription of vitamin D or its metabolites within 15-30 days before hospitalization were recorded. The effect of treatment with vitamin D metabolites for other indication previous to the hospitalization was studied with respect to patient survival by means of Kaplan-Meyer survival curves and Log Hazard Ratios, using a propensity score to compensate the disbalance of compared classes and the confounding factors. The availability of detailed patient data in the BPS allowed to obtain Real-World Evidence (RWE) of the effects of prior use of vitamin D or its metabolites on the mortality due to COVID-19 infection. Findings: A retrospective cohort of 16.401patients was extracted from the BPS, which includes all the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis between January and November 2020 in Andalusia, one of the largest regions in Europe with the size of an average median country. A total of 358 patients were found with cholecalciferol, and 193 with calcifediol, prescriptions 15 days before hospitalization. For a period extended to 30 days before hospitalization, the numbers increase to 416 and 210 and, respectively. Kaplan-Meyer survival curves and hazard ratios support an association between consumption of these metabolites and patient survival. Such association was stronger in calcifediol (Log Hazard Ratio, LHR = -1.27±0.32) than in cholecalciferol (LHR= -0.56±0.15), when prescribed 15 days before hospitalization This effect decreases when a larger 30 days period is considered (calcifediol LHR= -1.01±0.27 and cholecalciferol LHR= -0.27±0.12), suggesting that the closer was the treatment to the hospitalization the stronger the association. Conclusions: A significant reduction in mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with the prescription of vitamin D, especially calcifediol, within 15-30 days prior to hospitalization.

What does a -1.27 lhr mean in this case? I thought that number would always be positive.,n1z3v8,2021-04-30 20:59:26

">NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, April 30, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced they have submitted a variation to the Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) in the European Union (EU) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine COMIRNATY® (BNT162b2) to request an extension of the indication for use in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. If EMA approves the variation, the amended CMA will be valid in all 27 member states of the EU. The companies have already submitted a similar request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and plan to request additional amendments with other regulatory authorities worldwide.

>This submission is based on data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, which enrolled 2,260 participants aged 12 to 15 years. Topline results from this trial, announced on March 31, 2021, showed a vaccine efficacy of 100% in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and robust antibody responses. In the trial, the vaccine also was generally well tolerated. Participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.",n1rnqr,2021-04-30 12:16:57

"**Abstract**

We compared the serum neutralizing antibody titers before and after two doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in ten individuals who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination to 20 individuals with no history of infection, against clinical isolates of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. Vaccination boosted pre-existing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies 10-fold in previously infected individuals, but not to levels significantly higher than those of uninfected vaccinees. However, neutralizing antibody titers increased in previously infected vaccinees relative to uninfected vaccinees against every variant tested: 5.2-fold against B.1.1.7, 6.5-fold against B.1.351, 4.3-fold against P.1, and 3.4-fold against original SARS-CoV-2. Our study indicates that a first-generation COVID-19 vaccine provides broad protection from SARS-CoV-2 variants in individuals with previous infection.",n1b9be,2021-04-29 19:49:58
"Interesting - the previously infected cohort ranged from 15-302 days post-positive PCR test based on what I see in the study, but I don't see anything indicating whether or not distance from infection correlated to any degree of change in the increase in neutralization vs. the variants. I'd be very curious to see if it made a difference, and if so, how much.",n1b9be,2021-04-29 21:27:40
But what about the protection before getting the vaccine? Has anyone read the complete study?,n1b9be,2021-04-30 02:44:57
"It's a short study with only 2 figures. You can take a look yourself. But basically, amongst 10 patients who had previously been infected, it looks like 3-5 of them had some levels of neutralizing antibodies against the WT strain, the UK strain, and the Brazilian strain. But none of them had neutralizing antibodies against the South African strain B.1.351.

It does look to me like the South African strain is most likely to cause re-infection.",n1b9be,2021-04-30 03:25:51
Is neutralizing just a technical distinction on top of regular antibody measures or is this saying literally 0 protection against SA strain.,n1b9be,2021-04-30 14:12:51
"Neutralizing antibodies are a more stringent but also more relevant way of measuring antibody response. Most of the time, antibody tests simply measure how much antibody binds to spike protein (or rather, usually it's how many fold the serum can be diluted and still detectably bind to spike protein). However, some antibodies bind to parts of the spike protein in a way that don't interfere with virus infection. Neutralizing antibodies are those that interfere with virus infection, typically by binding to the part of the spike protein that interfaces with ACE2 receptor. To test for neutralizing antibodies, they need to use either the virus itself or a safer virus substitute bearing the spike protein, and add that to cells together with the patient serum, and see how the serum interferes with infection.

That being said, this test is still likely to be an underestimate of protection. While the neutralizing antibodies may be low at the moment of exposure, within a couple of days, the person's memory B cells are likely to ""wake up"" and multiply and pump out lots of antibody, so that the person recovers with no symptoms or mild symptoms. Also, there are T cell responses too that will probably help protect against the SA strain (T cells typically recognize more conserved parts of the virus that haven't been mutating much).",n1b9be,2021-04-30 14:47:45

"Highlights

•

Numerous SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergize to suppress immune sensing and signaling

•

Nsp14 targets IFNAR1 for lysosomal degradation

•

ORF3a and ORF7a block autophagy by different mechanisms

•

Synergistic treatment with IFN-γ and -λ1 is highly effective against SARS-CoV-2

Summary

SARS-CoV-2 evades most innate immune responses, but may still be vulnerable to some. Here, we systematically analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on interferon (IFN) responses and autophagy. We show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergize to counteract antiviral immune responses. For example, Nsp14 targets the type I IFN receptor for lysosomal degradation, ORF3a prevents fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, and ORF7a interferes with autophagosome acidification. Most activities are evolutionarily conserved. However, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 antagonizes IFN signaling less efficiently than the orthologues of closely-related RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 proteins counteract autophagy and type I IFN more efficiently than type II or III IFN signaling and infection experiments confirmed potent inhibition by IFN-γ and -λ1. Our results define the repertoire and selected mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonists, but also reveal vulnerability to type II and III IFN that may help to develop safe and effective anti-viral approaches.",n1eq7k,2021-04-29 23:24:06

"**COPENHAGEN, Denmark, April 29, 2021** – Bavarian  Nordic A/S today reported additional preclinical  data for the capsid virus-like particle (cVLP) COVID-19 vaccine  candidate, ABNCoV2, confirming its ability to induce neutralizing  antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Bavarian Nordic previously reported preclinical data, showing that  two doses of non-adjuvanted ABNCoV2 led to >50-fold higher titers of  neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (Wuhan) virus when  compared to titers  measured in convalescent human samples, and this  translated into protection from a challenge with wild-type virus. A  neutralization test of samples from the study has now confirmed  similarly high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV2  variants B.1.1.7 (British) and B.1.351 (South African). These are highly  encouraging results as it has been reported that high levels of  neutralizing antibodies are highly predictive of protection (Khoury et  al. doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.21252641).

“We are pleased to confirm the strong antibody response against  emerging and more concerning variants of SARS-CoV2 for our COVID-19  vaccine candidate,“ said Paul Chaplin, President and Chief Executive  Officer of Bavarian Nordic. “No approved COVID-19 vaccine, including  those based on mRNA technology, have shown the same levels of immunity  against the main circulating strain (Wuhan) and the South African  variant and if these results are confirmed in the on-going clinical  study, then we might be looking at the first universal COVID-19  vaccine”.

Bavarian Nordic licensed ABNCoV2 from AdaptVac in 2020, and earlier  this year, a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial was initiated at the Radhoud  University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, one of the members of the  PREVENT-nCoV consortium which is funded by a Horizon 2020 EU grant.  Bavarian Nordic has decided to further advance the development of  ABNCoV2 by investing in a Phase 2 clinical trial and to scale up  manufacturing in preparation for further clinical development towards  licensure. Planned to start in the second quarter of 2021, the Phase 2  study will investigate the ability of ABNCoV2 to boost existing immunity  through prior vaccination, to create a more durable immune response  that could protect against the current circulating variants of COVID-19.  In parallel the Company continues to seek funding to further progress  the candidate through Phase 3 towards licensure.",n1a7nj,2021-04-29 19:02:29

"Abstract

Many countries introduced the requirement to wear masks in public spaces for containing SARS-CoV-2 making it commonplace in 2020. Up until now, there has been no comprehensive investigation as to the adverse health effects masks can cause. The aim was to find, test, evaluate and compile scientifically proven related side effects of wearing masks. For a quantitative evaluation, 44 mostly experimental studies were referenced, and for a substantive evaluation, 65 publications were found. The literature revealed relevant adverse effects of masks in numerous disciplines. In this paper, we refer to the psychological and physical deterioration as well as multiple symptoms described because of their consistent, recurrent and uniform presentation from different disciplines as a Mask-Induced Exhaustion Syndrome (MIES). We objectified evaluation evidenced changes in respiratory physiology of mask wearers with significant correlation of O2 drop and fatigue (p < 0.05), a clustered co-occurrence of respiratory impairment and O2 drop (67%), N95 mask and CO2 rise (82%), N95 mask and O2 drop (72%), N95 mask and headache (60%), respiratory impairment and temperature rise (88%), but also temperature rise and moisture (100%) under the masks. Extended mask-wearing by the general population could lead to relevant effects and consequences in many medical fields.

"Testing for replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) is a requirement of many regulatory authorities for the reasons the blog mentions.  Production is by growing the recombinant virus on the helper cell line and there is always the very small chance that the recombinant could recover the excised genes it needs for replication (those are replaced by the S gene form SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccine strain) from that cell line by homologous recombination.  The more generations the virus is grown, the higher the risk as the RCA can certainly grow on the helper cell line.

To reduce the risk, culture is done by tiered seeds.  A part of the initial master virus seed (MVS) culture is expanded and split into working virus seeds (MVS) that are then sampled to seed production cultures thereby minimising the number of generations for each production batch.  You really want clean seeds to minimise risks.

You can see how the EU regulator dealt with this issue when communicating with Astra-Zeneca on [Vaxzevria](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/vaxzevria-previously-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf).  AZ did not submit RCA testing data and were told in no uncertain terms to produce it (page 17).  The regulator subsequently reviewed the data and the seed and production testing protocols for RCA before approval.

"Do we already know if the RCA found in the vaccine was an unintentional occurrence - replication-deficient Ad5 that recombined with HEK239 cells’ E1 region and reacquired that sequence -  or if it was Ad5 actually designed as replication-competent recombinant vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike - or something else entirely? 
And if it’s the former, the whole coding sequence for the spike protein would have been substituted for the E1 and we wouldn’t get any anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity from it, right? So I highly doubt they wouldn’t be especially careful about that, as their vaccine would probably lose efficacy while gaining higher reactogenicity/adverse effects.

Honestly, I find it really odd that no official document (to my knowledge) from gamaleya (product data sheet, phase 3 interim analysis) especifically refers to Sputnik V as a replication-deficient vector vaccine (or replication-competent, for that matter). It seems they have really made a point of omitting this crucial information. 

I heavily suspect that the RCA may actually be part of their vaccine strategy - a recombinant Ad5 vector (+ S protein gene) from the start, intentionally thrown in there in order to increase efficacy. Anvisa said that they have admitted their quality control was “permissive” of the presence of RCA in the final product.",n0h1mx,2021-04-29 02:15:06

So something went badly wrong in the production and QC process. You’re infecting people with a replicating adenovirus!
* Adenovirus infections are known to cause uncommon but very serious complications and you don’t really want to inject them into healthy people. Especially the Sputnik adenoviruses which might possibly be very bad as infections (no one knows nor wants to find out)

"Ok... but still, this is not an “official document” and, unlike Ox/Az and J&J, they never unequivocally say “Gam-COVID-Vac is a non-replicant recombinant SARS-CoV-2 adenovirus vectored vaccine”, or something along these lines. Note the wording of the [paper] (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00234-8/fulltext) from their phase 3 interim analysis: 

>These characteristics make recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccines suitable candidates for the WHO target product profiles for long-term protection of people at high risk of COVID-19 in outbreak settings because they stimulate rapid onset of protective immunity.

[...]

>Gam-COVID-Vac is a combined vector vaccine, based on rAd type 26 (rAd26) and rAd type 5 (rAd5)—both of which carry the gene for SARS-CoV-2 full-length glycoprotein S (rAd26-S and rAd5-S).

A bit sneaky, I would say. They are just stating that non-replicant adenovirus vectored vaccines are suitable covid-19 vaccine candidates, but don’t 100% clearly say that’s the platform of **their** vaccine. They never specify the genes deleted/substituted from the vector either. Like on their webpage, they just make general remarks. In fact, they say “the gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed“. This is innacurate and if it is indeed replication-deficient, it should have said “the gene from adenovirus, which ~~causes the infection~~ **enables replication**, is removed. There’s not one mention of replication competence on what I believe is their official [data sheet] (https://55v3ckrflgw3sg2kfsaqwiijsa-ac5fdsxevxq4s5y-medum-ru.translate.goog/sputnik-v) either.

>The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) consists of the **replication-deficient** simian adenovirus vector ChAdOx1, containing the full-length structural surface glycoprotein (spike protein) of SARS-CoV-2, with a tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 expresses a codon-optimised coding sequence for the spike protein (GenBank accession number MN908947).

">**Background**

>Reinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been documented, raising public health concerns. SARS-CoV-2 reinfections were assessed in a cohort of antibody-positive persons in Qatar.

>**Methods**

>All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons from April 16 to December 31, 2020 with a PCR-positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test were investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection. Incidence of reinfection was compared to incidence of infection in the complement cohort of those who were antibody-negative.

>**Findings**

>Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0–34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56–0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0–45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22–14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1–96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.

>**Interpretation**

>Reinfection is rare in the young and international population of Qatar. Natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against reinfection with an efficacy ~95% for at least seven months.",n0fbwe,2021-04-28 14:55:42
"So, I'm genuinely a little confused by this report. 

Is there legitimately a concern that our immune systems wouldn't do what our immune systems have always done and provide long term immunity with this virus? Why is this a concern?

"Good results, but on the high end of what people have seen. It's pretty hard to quantify protection from reinfection since people who got infected the first time may have factors (work exposure, social contacts, lower carefulness ) that make them prone to be reinfected again and may additionally be less careful believing themselves to be protected.",n0fbwe,2021-04-28 16:00:07

"I think two things - 1. The earliest reports showed  immunity fading pretty rapidly. 2. Other coronaviruses (the common cold kind) seem to have reinfection potential. This led to a concern that the antibody response might not be durable. We also don't know, with certainty, how evasive the variants are for natural infection - the vaccines seem to do a great job, but the natural response is weaker.

Happy to be corrected if I got any of that wrong.

Bottom line is that we've only got one year of experience with this virus. I'm hopeful that natural infection will produce a long-lasting, robust protection. It would mean that the vaccines would do the same, but even more so. It would also mean the anti-vax people who get infected are still helping towards herd immunity, as opposed to just being temporarily out of the game.

So I wouldn't say this result was unexpected, but personally I think its both ""news"" (because it was sort of expected) and ""good news"" (because of the uncertainty).",n0fbwe,2021-04-28 22:17:15

"Abstract

Objective: To assess the effectiveness of aerosol filtration by portable air cleaning devices with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters used in addition to standard building heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC). 

Methods: Test rooms, including a hospital single-patient room, were filled with test aerosol to simulate aerosol movement. Aerosol counts were measured over time with various portable air cleaning devices and room ventilation systems to quantify the aerosol concentration reduction rate and overall clearance rate.

 Results: Portable air cleaners were very effective in removing aerosols, especially for the devices with high flow rate. In a small control room, the aerosols were cleared 4 to 5 times faster with portable air cleaners than the room with HVAC alone. A single bed hospital room equipped with an excellent ventilation rate (~ 14 air changes per hour) can clear the aerosols in 20 minutes. However, with the addition of two air cleaners, the clearance time became 3 times faster (in 6 minutes and 30 seconds). 

Conclusions: Portable air cleaning devices with HEPA filtration were highly effective at removing aerosols. To clear aerosols (above 90% clearance) in under 10 minutes requires around 25 air changes per hour; readily feasible with air cleaners. Inexpensive portable air cleaning devices should be considered for small and enclosed spaces in health care settings such as inpatient rooms, personal protective equipment donning/doffing stations, and staff tea rooms. Portable air cleaners are particularly important where there is limited ability to reduce aerosol transmission with building HVAC ventilation.",n0oflx,2021-04-29 00:46:35
"I don't quite understand this study, it seems like they're comparing under-equipped and ineffective HVAC with a personal filter

If the air is changed 14 times per hour, yet the aerosol still remains, surely by definition the air isn't changed and the system isn't working properly. Where is their figure for 14x per hour coming from?

In theory, HVAC intake is outside, air is brought in, filtered, heated/cooled, (de)humidified, pushed to rooms and pulled out of rooms, with the recirculation happening for the heat contained within it not the actual air via HRU. In buildings with infection control there is supposed to be negative pressure dominance (it pulls more than it pushes)

Not that personal filtration doesn't work, but it's noisy and inefficient. The whole point of the duct work and handling unit/system is that the noisy oily parts are on the roof, and by economy of scale you use less power to accomplish the task and less manpower to maintain it",n0oflx,2021-04-29 05:28:41
"> If the air is changed 14 times per hour, yet the aerosol still remains, surely by definition the air isn't changed and the system isn't working properly.

""Air changes per hour"" doesn't literally mean all the air in the room is changed.  It's simply (air flow per hour)/(room volume).

Say you've got a 1000 cubic foot room.  A 14 ACPH system will thus be moving 14000 cubic feet of air in and out of that room every hour.  That's all it means.

A good system will actually change about 63% of the physical air in the room per air change.",n0oflx,2021-04-29 06:30:12
"That's what I mean though, if you can change the air volume 14 times/hr  and still not clear it, then something isn't working, even if that's just the location of the vents or lack of air movement within it, dead spots etc.

My math might be wrong on this but I got it at 19% air change efficiency for the limping HVAC used as contrasting control that they're calling ""excellent ventilation rate"". I also worked out that if the HVAC had the 63% vent rate you mentioned still on a 14 times/hr rate, it would have cleared the room in just under 6 minutes 25 seconds - so the equal to  and on par with the roughly 3 times faster stated for the personal one without the noise and disruption

Personal filtration is a powerful fan in front of a HEPA filter, it's forcing air to move even if it's not replenishing it, in a sort of double funnel pattern. The filters will be used up much quicker (than filtering clean outdoor air as primary side of the intake and exhausting the dirty air somewhere else), the electrical cost is higher, the maintenance effort is greater, and you need to buy 2 for every room to match  the study

&#x200B;

I'd argue the same would be achieved with either a working, correctly installed HVAC system... or a HVAC system with a ceiling fan in each room

...and you'd have fresh air from outside not recirculated which will concentrate anything that does not get caught in a HEPA filter, even more so if they turn down the refresh rate on the HVAC because ""well we've got personal ones now, costing us a bundle, knock it down to 6/hr""",n0oflx,2021-04-29 08:19:49
"Using eq. 2.1.6 in [this book on air rate change measurements](https://www.aivc.org/sites/default/files/members_area/medias/pdf/Guides/GUAG%20MEASUREMENT%20TECHNIQUES.pdf), with C(t=10)/C(0) \~ 0.5 gave Q/V = ACN = 4.1, i.e. roughly 30% efficiency, a bit higher than your calculations. Still, seems quite low considering how small the room is.

Using the same calculations for the control room with C(t=40)/C(0) = 0.2 gave roughly 100% efficiency.",n0oflx,2021-04-29 13:01:40

"Summary

What is already known about this topic?

Clinical trials suggest high efficacy for COVID-19 vaccines, but evaluation of vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes in real-world settings and in populations at high risk, including older adults, is needed.

What is added by this report?

In a multistate network of U.S. hospitals during January–March 2021, receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines was 94% effective against COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults and 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults aged ≥65 years.

What are the implications for public health practice?

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines significantly reduce the risk for COVID-19–associated hospitalization in older adults and, in turn, might lead to commensurate reductions in post-COVID conditions and deaths.",n0hcwd,2021-04-28 16:28:20
Title is confusing. It reads they are vaccinating people >65 hospitalized with covid. But the summary says otherwise.,n0hcwd,2021-04-28 16:50:10
"This data is very close to My analysis of Washington State DoH data of breakthrough cases and deaths. (Source: https://www.doh.wa.gov/Newsroom/Articles/ID/2740/Update-on-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-in-Washington-state).  While the DoH data doesn’t align the vaccination timing, I combined their data with CDC data on timing of fully vaccinated +2 weeks, along daily reported cases and deaths in WA. I get 94% effectiveness on reducing cases and 93% on reducing deaths. This is based on a mere 217 breakthrough cases and 5 deaths, so the n is small, and I’d like a bigger data set, but few states have done the work WA did to get a more comprehensive count. Note that WA’s first count a week earlier was about half the cases for the same time period. I suspect states are under counting breakthrough cases if they are counting at all. The US needs better data on breakthrough cases, hospitalizations and deaths because efficacy projections have a meaningful impact on rate of transmission models.

We should keep in mind that the effectiveness is based on the context of mask wearing and social distancing from January to end of March. Phase 3 was also in a “more masked/social distanced” context. As mask wearing and other NPI abate, I’d expect efficacy to decline. Maybe to 85% to 90%. If anyone has an model to predict how efficacy declines as mask wearing/social distancing is reduced, please share it.

Still, 94% is great news, and puts a lot of downward pressure on the virus. I expect 21 day lagged CFR to go down from 1.7% to 0.9 by end of next month. It is already down to 1.1%.

"I ended up finding this post after reading through the study a few times, and still emerging confused.  


My initial question was ""what is the 64% being compared to?"". The study makes it sound as if someone over 65 gets covid, and has 1 dose of vaccine, there is still a 36% chance they end up in the hospital - but that seems way off.   


So I think I was reading the data wrong.   


Are they looking at 2 groups of people, and among those, discovering that having one dose led to a 64% chance of avoiding a hospitalization?   


That makes more sense - except, I don't understand where the control group would have come from.   


The case-patients are all hospitalized - so they seem to have a 100% chance of being hospitalized. Comparing that to any ""random"" group seems unhelpful.

"All these subjects were hospitalized for Covid like symptoms. This article uses pcr positive test as the sole criterion to define a Covid case. We all know two things: pcr test has high false negative rate (20% to 50%) mainly due to insufficient sampling; vaccination reduces viral load in respiratory tract.  It’s reasonable to speculate vaccinated Covid patients would have higher false negative pcr rate. Actually in the phase 3 clinical trial reports, we already saw patients with x-ray indicating Covid, but pcr negative. One interesting case from Moderna is that the patient was hospitalized with oxygen saturation of 80%. He got negative pcr test in the hospital, but he got a positive pcr test by himself before hospitalization. 

Therefore, it’s very interesting to find out why these patients were hospitalized with Covid symptoms but negative PCR results.",n0hcwd,2021-04-28 19:38:23

"Abstract

Introduction

The outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread worldwide. The need for specific treatments to adequately stop the inflammatory response and its sequelae is day by day more urgent and many therapeutic strategies were performed since COVID-19 burst in the last months. Statins were thought to be effective against this novel coronavirus for their anti-inflammatory properties, even if the real effects on COVID patients are still partially unexplored.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 501 adult patients, consecutively admitted to the two COVID-hospitals of Ferrara’s territory, and divided them into two groups: ST = patients on statin therapy on admission and NST=patients not on statin therapy on admission. We searched for differences between groups in terms of anamnestic, clinical and laboratory data and then in terms of COVID-19 outcomes.

Results

We found significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidities, procalcitonin and CPK serum levels: ST patients were older, more comorbid, with lower procalcitonin and higher CPK serum levels. Male sex was, together with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, an independent predictor of needing intensification of care, while age only was a good predictor of in-hospital and 100-day mortality. Differences were also found in the survival functions between the two groups.

Conclusions

After a period of observation of 100 days, ST patients, despite their older age and their greater load of comorbidities, have similar survival functions to NST patients. If adjusted for age and CCI the survival functions of ST group are considerably more favourable than those of the second group.",n0sd5m,2021-04-29 01:05:39

Between Dec 8, and March 10, 2021, 627 383 individuals reported being vaccinated with 655 590 doses: 282 103 received one dose of BNT162b2, of whom 28 207 received a second dose, and 345 280 received one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Systemic side-effects were reported by 13·5% (38 155 of 282 103) of individuals after the first dose of BNT162b2, by 22·0% (6216 of 28 207) after the second dose of BNT162b2, and by 33·7% (116 473 of 345 280) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Local side-effects were reported by 71·9% (150 023 of 208 767) of individuals after the first dose of BNT162b2, by 68·5% (9025 of 13 179) after the second dose of BNT162b2, and by 58·7% (104 282 of 177 655) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Systemic side-effects were more common (1·6 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 2·9 times after the first dose of BNT162b2) among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection than among those without known past infection. Local effects were similarly higher in individuals previously infected than in those without known past infection (1·4 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 1·2 times after the first dose of BNT162b2). 3106 of 103 622 vaccinated individuals and 50 340 of 464 356 unvaccinated controls tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant reductions in infection risk were seen starting at 12 days after the first dose, reaching 60% (95% CI 49–68) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 69% (66–72) for BNT162b2 at 21–44 days and 72% (63–79) for BNT162b2 after 45–59 days.”

"Abstract

The robust protection conferred by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines represents a critical milestone in the COVID-19 vaccine development. However, the emergence of variants has inspired renewed concern related to the protective efficacy of currently approved vaccines, which lose neutralizing potency against some variants. However, emerging data suggest that antibody functions, beyond neutralization, may contribute to protection from disease. Thus, here we profiled the binding and functional capacity of convalescent antibodies and Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibodies across SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). While neutralizing antibody responses are affected by VOCs, antibodies generated after infection exhibited robust binding to VOCs but compromised interactions with Fc-receptors. Conversely, vaccine-induced antibodies bound robustly to VOCs and continued interacting with Fc-receptors and mediated antibody effector functions. These data point to a previously unappreciated resilience in the mRNA vaccine-induced humoral immune response that may continue to provide protection from SARS-CoV-2 VOCs independent of neutralization.",n0k1al,2021-04-28 18:28:04

">**Importance**

>This is the first study to examine the impact of SARS-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination on ovarian function.

>**Objective**

>To characterize anti-COVID-19 antibodies in follicular fluid and compare ovarian follicle function in women following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, and non-infected, unvaccinated controls.

>**Design**

>This is a cohort study conducted between February 1 and March 10, 2021.

>**Setting**

>A single university hospital-based IVF clinic.

>**Participants**

>Consecutive sample of female patients undergoing oocyte retrieval.

>**Interventions**

>Consenting patients were recruited and assigned to one of three study groups: recovering from confirmed COVID 19 (n=9); vaccinated (n=9); and uninfected, non-vaccinated controls (n=14). Serum and follicular fluid samples were taken and analyzed for anti-COVID IgG as well as estrogen, progesterone and HSPG2 concentration, as well as the number and maturity of aspirated oocytes and previous estrogen and progesterone measurements.

>**Main outcome measures**

>Follicular function, including steroidogenesis, follicular response to the LH/hCG trigger, and oocyte quality biomarkers.

>**Results**

>Both natural and vaccine elicited anti-COVID IgG antibodies were detected in the follicular fluid in levels proportional to the IgG serum concentration. No differences were detected in any of the surrogate ovarian follicle quality reporting parameters.

>**Conclusions and relevance**

>Both SARS-COV-2 infection and vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine mediate IgG immunity that crosses into the follicular fluid. No detrimental effect on follicular function was detected.",n0anf1,2021-04-28 10:05:49

"No abstract for some reason, so I'll leave this from the discussion instead:

>These results show that the likelihood of household transmission is 40-50% lower for households in which the index cases are vaccinated 21 days or more prior to testing positive (compared to no vaccination), with similar effects for both ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 vaccines. Results persisted after adjustment for measured covariates. This effect on onward transmission in the household was particularly apparent for index cases aged less than 70 years. A matched case-control analysis also demonstrated similarly reduced odds ratios for secondary infections in household contacts.

This is also on top of the reduction in infection risk in the first place, meaning protection in real terms is much greater than 40-50%.",n0blgc,2021-04-28 11:18:55
"So the majority of the subjects had had only one vaccine, actually, right?",n0blgc,2021-04-28 15:45:29
"So that means 40-50% of those confirmed to be infected, transmitted within the household?",n0blgc,2021-04-28 11:39:40
"Yes, second doses didn't really start in any large numbers until April so nearly all of the subjects in the study would have only had one dose.",n0blgc,2021-04-29 03:03:18

"No. Even without vaccination, household secondary attack rates aren't 100% or near to it.",n0blgc,2021-04-28 19:20:48
So in simple big picture terms I'm understanding it that with mRNA vaccines a person has approx 90% less likely chance to still get infected with covid19 when exposed after vaccination.  Then this study is suggesting that out of those few who still get infected despite vaccination others in the household have approx 50% less chance that they will in turn catch covid from the vaccinated but still infected person.  Meaning the vaccinated infected are less contagious.,n0blgc,2021-04-28 16:11:36

ACE2 is part of the telomere replenishment/lengthening process that we still don't understand. We do know that it's part of the telomere ""aging"" process and that those with elevated levels telomeres ""age"" more slowly. 

The study found that the average rate of age acceleration was 5.25 years higher than the typical acceleration age. It also showed that telomerase length was significantly shortened compared to what it should be.

We just don't know enough to say which came first for sure, but given the that both of these condition occurred in ALL the study patients strongly suggests that covid is the cause of this drastic shortening and drop in ACE2

If you had covid this doesn't mean you've lost five years of your lifetime necessarily. Telomerase age is related to longevity but longevity is very complicated and we cannot guess how long someone will live based on telomerase length alone.

Abstract

Introduction

As the first randomized clinical trial, this study evaluated the effect of Famotidine on the improvement of outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.


Method

This phase III randomized clinical trial was designed with two parallel arms, placebo-controlled, single-blind, and concealed allocation, and recruited 20 patients. Oral Famotidine 160 mg four times a day was given to patients until the discharge day or for a maximum of 14 days. Patients’ temperature, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, lung infiltration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and complete blood count (CBC) were measured at the baseline (before the intervention) and on day 14 after the intervention or on discharge day. Length of stay in the hospital and length of stay in the ICU were also measured as secondary outcomes of the study.


Results

The results showed a significant decrease in LDH (P = 0.01), mean WBC (P = 0.04) and length of stay (P = 0.04) of patients with COVID-19 in the group treated with Famotidine compared to the control group. There was also a significant increase in oxygen saturation (P = 0.01) in the group treated with Famotidine compared to the control group. Cough improvement was also higher in the oral Famotidine group compared to the control group (P = 0.02).


Conclusion

This was the first clinical trial on the effect of Famotidine on the improvement of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which indicated that high-dose Famotidine improves patients’ clinical signs and reduces the severity of the disease and duration of hospitalization.",n0b3jl,2021-04-28 10:38:40

Does anyone know if the claims carrageenan can be carcinogenic holds any truth if used as a nasal spray? Sure I read somewhere it was only when ingesting large amounts but can't find it,n0aeai,2021-04-28 09:53:15
"**Abstract**

There are, except for remdesivir, no approved antivirals for the treatment or prevention of SARS- CoV-2 infections. Iota-carrageenan formulated into a nasal spray has already been proven safe and effective in viral respiratory infections. We explored this antiviral activity in Calu-3, a human respiratory model cell line. A formula of iota-carrageenan and sodium chloride, as a nasal spray, already approved for human use, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, providing a more substantial reference for further clinical studies or developments.",n0aeai,2021-04-28 11:30:37
"

> ""There have been reports that carrageenan may induce IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) or colon cancer, mainly based on experiments with rats that have been fed with a diet containing very high concentrations of degraded carrageenan. Carrageenan is used in three different subtypes: iota, kappa, and lambda carrageenan that differ in their structure with respect to the number of sulfate groups. While lambda carrageenan has been shown to have pro-inflammatory properties, iota and kappa carrageenan have not such a potential. The raw material for the Carragelose products [in these nasal sprays] is tested for the presence of lambda-carrageenan and also the size of the polymer is tested. Carragelose (iota-carrageenan) is free of lambda-carrageenan and has a mean size of more than 1 million Dalton (very large) and it is also free of degraded components.

 > Taken together the use of Carragelose products poses no risk of developing IBD or colon cancer as they are devoid of lambda-carrageenan and degraded carrageenan. In addition, the daily intake is magnitudes lower compared to the maximum daily intake. 

> The maximum daily intake of carrageenan has been set to 75 mg/kg/day for humans and is much higher compared to the amount of carrageenan in Carragelose products even if they are extensively used. The nasal spray contains 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan and a use of 4 times daily results in 1.34 mg/day""",n0aeai,2021-04-28 18:07:23

"Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Neutralizing antibodies target the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S) protein, a focus of successful vaccine efforts. Concerns have arisen that S-specific vaccine immunity may fail to neutralize emerging variants. We show that vaccination with HAd5 expressing the nucleocapsid (N) protein can establish protective immunity, defined by reduced weight loss and viral load, in both Syrian hamsters and k18-hACE2 mice. Challenge of vaccinated mice was associated with rapid N-specific T cell recall responses in the respiratory mucosa. This study supports the rationale for including additional viral antigens, even if they are not a target of neutralizing antibodies, to broaden epitope coverage and immune effector mechanisms.",n0797c,2021-04-28 05:53:16

>**Summary**


>COVID-19 is associated with a high incidence of thrombotic complications, which can be explained by the complex and unique interplay between coronaviruses and endothelial cells, the local and systemic inflammatory response, and the coagulation system. Empirically, an intensified dose of thrombosis prophylaxis is being used in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and several guidelines on this topic have been published, although the insufficiency of high quality and direct evidence has led to weak recommendations. In this Viewpoint we summarise the pathophysiology of COVID-19 coagulopathy in the context of patients who are ambulant, admitted to hospital, and critically ill or non-critically ill, and those post-discharge from hospital. We also review data from randomised controlled trials in the past year of antithrombotic therapy in patients who are critically ill. These data provide the first high-quality evidence on optimal use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for patients who are ambulant and post-discharge. A first ever trial in non-critically ill patients who were admitted to hospital has shown that a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin might improve clinical outcomes in this population. In critically ill patients, this same treatment does not improve outcomes and prophylactic dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended. In the upcoming months we expect numerous data from the ongoing antithrombotic COVID-19 studies to guide clinicians at different stages of the disease.",n06srx,2021-04-28 09:13:18

"**Abstract**

Ending the COVID-19 pandemic will require long-lived immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated 254 COVID-19 patients longitudinally from early infection and for eight months thereafter and found a predominant broad-based immune memory response. SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing antibodies exhibited a bi-phasic decay with an extended half-life of >200 days suggesting the generation of longer-lived plasma cells. In addition, there was a sustained IgG+ memory B cell response, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure. Polyfunctional virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also generated and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days. Interestingly, the CD4+ T cell response equally targeted several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whereas the CD8+ T cell response preferentially targeted the nucleoprotein, highlighting the importance of including the nucleoprotein as a potential vaccine antigen. Taken together, these results suggest that broad and effective immunity may persist long-term in recovered COVID-19 patients.",mztxfc,2021-04-27 18:36:09

"Google Translated from Portuguese:

>Due to the lack of consistent and reliable data, Anvisa's Board of Directors (Dicol) unanimously decided not to recommend the exceptional importation of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. of the 30-day period established by the Federal Supreme Court (STF), in a decision rendered by Minister Ricardo Lewandowski.

>The decision was made based on data collected and evaluated by the technical teams of the general management of Medicines and Biological Products (GGMED), Sanitary Inspection and Inspection (GGFIS) and the Monitoring of Products Subject to Health Surveillance (GGMON). The General Management of Ports, Airports and Customs Enclosures (GGPAF) and the Office of International Affairs (Ainte) also participated in the survey.

>According to the rapporteur of the process, director Alex Machado Campos, the decision is a portrait of the moment. He pointed out that the Agency is known for making access to medicines and vaccines feasible and that, in this pandemic moment, the institution has acted at the limit, but that there is no flexibility in relation to product safety.

>The rapporteur also stated that Anvisa's daily challenge is to establish whether the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks related to the product. “Security is an inalienable aspect in the face of risk uncertainty. We got here hand in hand with science and supported by evidence ”, said the director.

>To date, 14 states have sent import orders for the Sputnik V vaccine to Anvisa: Acre, Alagoas, Amapá, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pará, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Rondônia, Sergipe and Tocantins, in addition to the municipalities of Maricá and Niterói in Rio de Janeiro.

>**Failures and inconsistencies**

>According to GGMED, flaws in product development were identified in all stages of clinical studies (phases 1, 2 and 3). There is also an absence or insufficiency of quality control, safety and efficacy data. One of the worrying information regarding the evaluation of the data available so far is that the cells where the adenoviruses are produced for the development of the vaccine allow their replication. This can lead to infections in humans and can cause damage and death, especially in people with low immunity and respiratory problems, among other health problems.

>This aspect deviates from the quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Medicines for Human Use (International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use - ICH), followed by the main regulatory agencies in the world, including Anvisa.

>In addition, inadequate characterization studies of the vaccine were detected, including with regard to the analysis of impurities and contaminating viruses during the manufacturing process, in addition to the lack of validation / qualification of quality control methods, among several other aspects. It was also verified the absence of reproductive toxicity tests, which allow to verify if the product may or may not be harmful to the reproductive cells.  

>In its analysis, GGMON reinforced aspects pointed out by GGMED, but drew attention especially to the question of the lack of knowledge of adverse effects in the short, medium and long term resulting from the use of the vaccine.

>**Oversight**

>The Inspection area has also detected a number of problems related to the Sputnik V vaccine, including as a result of an inspection mission sent to Russia. According to GGFIS, due to the lack of a technical product approval report, it was not possible to identify the manufacturers of the biological pharmaceutical input used in the production of the Russian vaccine. Nor were any manufacturing conditions identified that demonstrate that the products are consistently produced and controlled. GGFIS also reported that, on Russian soil, the inspection team was denied access to the facilities of Gamaleya, the institute that developed the vaccine.",mzkvoo,2021-04-27 10:52:43

"Honestly, I wonder if maybe they didn’t add RCA to their vaccine *on purpose*? So to increase vaccine efficacy and then they omitted this fact to avoid having to deal with all the safety approvals and concerns. I find it really odd that no official document from Gamaleya (that I know of, though I might be wrong) unequivocally refers to the vector as replication deficient (as we can see in Ox/AZ and J&J’s papers, which actually describe the deleted/substituted genes and the method used to achieve that). Not even in the phase 3 interim results, not in the official data sheet. 
This is from the phase 3 [interim report] (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00234-8/fulltext):

>These characteristics make recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccines suitable candidates for the WHO target product profiles for long-term protection of people at high risk of COVID-19 in outbreak settings because they stimulate rapid onset of protective immunity.

[...]

>Gam-COVID-Vac is a combined vector vaccine, based on rAd type 26 (rAd26) and rAd type 5 (rAd5)—both of which carry the gene for SARS-CoV-2 full-length glycoprotein S (rAd26-S and rAd5-S).

They never specifically describe **their** vaccine vector as replication-deficient, they just mention that replication-deficient  adenovírus vectored vaccines are suitable candidates against covid-19. This seems like very sneaky language (possibly intentionally employed to mislead?).

And this is apparently the official [data sheet] (https://55v3ckrflgw3sg2kfsaqwiijsa-ac5fdsxevxq4s5y-medum-ru.translate.goog/sputnik-v). Not one mention of it being replication-deficient or otherwise.

"That would be about the only way it could happen if you *properly* use some sort of trans complement system.

In any case, it should be exceptionally easy to detect this issue. You put your recombinant virus on cells that don't have any E1 regions (if that's your trans complement, which I think is pretty common since J&J mentions it in the patents) and if you see any residual E1 expression, you've got problems. If it doesn't wash out after several passages, you've got problems. It's dead easy to realize you have some sort of upstream issue, even if you don't know how.

The FDA for instance is going to break Emergent's (the contract manufacturing org for J&J/Janssen) back over their vector swap issue (won't link as it's news). And technically the issue there isn't even nearly as bad as replication competent vaccine, it's swapping your process / inoculum agent, and it never shipped.

"#Abstract

**Background**

The mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have proven highly effective and are currently used to vaccinate all age groups against COVID-19. Despite their high efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on the impact of age, sex, and side effects on vaccine-induced immune responses.

**Methods**

We here studied the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain antibodies after two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 healthy volunteers and correlated their immune response with age, sex, and side effects reported after the vaccinations.

**Findings**

Our findings show a robust immune response to the Spike proteins RBD region after the first and the second vaccination dose. However, we also saw a decline of antibody levels at 6 weeks versus 1 week after the second dose, suggesting a waning of the immune response over time. Regardless of this, the antibody levels at 6 weeks after the second dose remained significantly higher than before the vaccination, after the first dose, or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, and that mRNA vaccination is less efficient in older males whereas the detrimental impact of age on vaccination outcome is abolished in females at 6 weeks after the second dose.

**Interpretation**

The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induces a strong immune response after two doses of vaccination but older individuals develop fewer side effects and decreased antibody levels at 6 weeks. The waning of anti-viral antibodies in particular in older male individuals suggests that both age and male sex act as risk factors in the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.",mztukg,2021-04-27 18:33:03

"#Abstract

**Background**

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Vaccines are an important part of the response. Although rare, unusual thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia in recipients 4-16 days after vaccination with the AstraZeneca AZD1222 have been reported. This syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) clinically resembles heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is caused by platelet activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). Here, we investigate the effect of serum from patients with VITT on platelet activation, and assess the ability of clinically available therapeutics to prevent platelet activation. 

**Methods**

Aggregation responses of healthy donor washed platelets were assessed in response to serum from patients with VITT pre- and post-intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and in the presence of anti-FcγRIIA blocking IV.3 F(ab), anti-platelet drugs and kinase inhibitors.

**Findings**

Four patients (21-48 years old) presented with thrombosis (three patients: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, one patient: ischemic stroke) and thrombocytopenia 10-14 days after AZD1222 vaccination. All patients tested positive for anti-PF4 antibody despite no prior heparin exposure. Serum from patients with VITT, but not healthy donor controls, induced platelet aggregation, which was abrogated following IVIg treatment. Aggregation to patient sera was blocked by IV.3 F(ab) which targets FcγRIIA, and inhibitors of Src, Syk and Btk kinases downstream of the receptor. Anti-platelet therapies indomethacin and ticagrelor also blocked aggregation. 

**Interpretation**

In conclusion, serum from patients with VITT activates platelets via the FcγRIIA, which can be blocked in vitro by anti-platelet therapies suggesting possible new therapeutic interventions for this rare syndrome.",mztz9h,2021-04-27 18:38:54

"**Abstract**

Mathematical models have largely failed to predict the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic. We revisit several variants of the SEIR-model and investigate various adjustments to the model in order to achieve output consistent with measured data in Manaus, India and Stockholm. In particular, Stockholm is interesting due to the almost constant NPI's, which substantially simplifies the mathematical modeling. Analyzing mobility data for Stockholm, we argue that neither behavioral changes, age and activity stratification nor NPI's alone are sufficient to explain the observed pandemic progression. We find that the most plausible hypothesis is that a large portion of the population, between 40 to 65 percent, have some protection against infection with the original variant of SARS-CoV-2.",mzttiq,2021-04-27 18:31:23

"Another explanation for discordant infections would be that a small proportion of the infected are superspreaders, and discordant infections feature non-superspreaders. Going to the pdf download link we find 

It can be argued that the type of stochastic models mentioned above are not apt for modeling of SARS-CoV-2, which
indeed is a peculiar virus that spreads in clusters, and it is estimated that 80% of the cases are caused by less than 20% of
infected individuals, the so called ”super spreaders” [1, 19]. In Section 7.3 we show that, rather surprisingly, adding this
complexity to the deterministic SEIR-model does not in any way alter the output. This is no longer true if randomness
is taken into account; in [23] a stochastic SEIR-model where R0 is a random variable (for each infected individual) with
a “fat-tailed” distribution, and while this displays an erratic and possibly more realistic behavior, its effect on Twave and
C19tot still does not seem to overcome the shortcomings discussed above (see in particular Figure 4 in [23]).
