"Hi, I'm almost 10 days post vaccine and I feel horrible. Everything in my body hurts... I tried doing yoga this morning, which pre-vaccine was easy for me, and I was so out of breath and it felt so hard. Then I tried going on a hike that I usually go on and it felt near impossible. I have headaches in weird places, strange aches and pains, and weakness. 

I feel like I'm getting worse every day at this point and I'm starting feel like... why did I do this?",lam09i,2021-02-03 01:01:55
"Got my first vaccine yesterday.


**Immediately-1hr** nothing, felt normal, no arm soreness


**1hr-6hrs** slight headache (although I think it was because I needed to eat) and tired. Arm started to get sore at about hour 2-3. 


**6 hrs-24 hrs** arm still sore, nothing else to report.

Edit: I did have a small rash around the injection site for days 2-4 . Slightly itchy but nothing bad.",lam09i,2021-02-02 18:27:23
"I got my first dose Saturday. 
On the day of, I felt nauseous and very tired. But was able to sort of get rid of that after eating dinner.

The second and third days, I had a slight sore throat. It isn‚Äôt officially listed as a symptom, but I thought I should mention it. 

I‚Äôm on the fourth day, and I currently have a bit of a headache and some slight fatigue. Nothing too bad.

I haven‚Äôt experienced what you‚Äôve described. But it‚Äôs also been less than a week, so we‚Äôll see.",lam09i,2021-02-03 00:33:04
I've already had both PB vaccines. Sore arm for 24hrs on both occasions but that's all üëç,lam09i,2021-02-03 09:24:05
"Had mine last Thursday. The next morning I had a sore arm and a bit of a headache but that is not uncommon. 

I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much, it is common to feel mild symptoms after a vaccine. It will pass so don‚Äôt get too much in your own head about it or you might cause some sort of placebo effect.

I would contact your doctor too because 1) they can reassure you much better than random people on the internet and 2) if anything is seriously wrong with you due to the vaccine then they are the person you should be talking to anyway

Hope you feel better soon",lam09i,2021-02-03 17:57:42
"I got my first shot Mar 8 (it‚Äôs the 14th today).  Sore at the spot of the shot, but really no other side effects. My friend who is in way better shape than me felt similar. We felt even BETTER than we normally did! Both in our late 30s.

I‚Äôll try to remember to update after the 2nd shot.

I did have a 3 min panic attack while sitting in the waiting room for 15 min after the shot. That was the worse part!

Also if you‚Äôre just browsing through Reddit and looking for vaccine experiences from people, understand that these types of posts are probably heavily skewed towards people with negative experiences. More than likely, it doesn‚Äôt even cross someone‚Äôs mind to post updates when they had zero to little reactions to the vaccine. Just throwing that out there bc reading this thread made me super nervous getting my shot!

My friend in her early 40s, in shape,  not obese, had a full day of fever and body weakness after the 2nd moderna shot. But she said it only lasted like a day. But her fever did get to 101, which freaked her out.

**2ND SHOT UPDATE (3/30):** I got my 2nd shot yesterday. I have slight soreness on the spot on my shoulder where I got the shot. And I feel muscle soreness and maybe a tiny sluggish today. Other than that, feel so happy that I got my shot! I have 3 other friends that got vaxxed at the same place (Pfizer shot) yesterday, and they all feel fine today :D

**3/31** \- feelin normal",lam09i,2021-03-14 19:11:39
Getting my second vaccine shot on Tuesday feb 9th. My first dose I had a headache and cloudy headed and took some pills and a nap and woke up fine but had arm soreness for about 3 days before it eventually went away. I‚Äôll be back to discuss my dose 2 journey,lam09i,2021-02-03 06:57:52
"Had my second shot 10 days ago, can still feel my body adjusting, light head, flush, headache a couple times, but overall not bad and feel grateful",lam09i,2021-02-06 03:56:14
"Received 1st dose 11:30 am Feb 7, Left Deltoid 
About 6hrs later achey upper left arm.  No other adverse effects to report 
Actually slept better knowing I‚Äôll be protected after second dose.  I am overweight 60 yo F with COPD",lam09i,2021-02-10 00:53:24
"33/F I got the first dose Wednesday morning. Immediately after- absolutely nothing, went straight back to work 

Wednesday evening-a little sore at the injection side but very mild

Thursday morning- just a little sore at the injection site, Thursday evening- shoulder slightly sore but also mild and manageable.",lam09i,2021-02-05 02:23:14
Had my first does this morning. I started feeling soreness in my neck on the side that  got my shot after. It felt like I had been sitting on the computer too long. About 2 hours later I felt exhausted-it‚Äôs been about 7 hours and I‚Äôve been dozing off all day. I have a little sore throat and my injection site is sore. No fever- it feels like my body is fighting off a cold or flu- not quite sick- but I don‚Äôt feel like doing much either.,lam09i,2021-02-05 22:21:46
Okay yes same here I got my vaccine last Thursday it is currently Monday evening and I have not moved from my bed in a very long time. Every time I get up it's exhausting. I have been sleeping for so long every single day. I don't know what's wrong with me but I am tired 24/7,lam09i,2021-02-02 05:23:22
"Hey all, I was SO NERVOUS to get my 2nd dose after reading through this thread but I wanted to share my experience in hopes it helps ease some anxiety. 

I am mental - I spent the past 5 weeks scouring the internet and social media for ANY information I could find on the Pfizer vaccine. Whether good or bad I just wanted all the information I could to make the best decision. 

Dose 1 - I got it on March 13th and I was extremely nervous. I got my dose, waited the 15 minutes and drove home. I was extremely anxious and just kept taking deep breaths to calm myself. To keep my mind busy I decided to go to Target (because Target is calming and the best). Walking through target I felt in a daze. I felt loopy and a bit dizzy, but by the time I left Target I felt much better. That day I cleaned my apartment and used my arm as much as I could to help the soreness. I went to bed with a sore arm and woke up the next morning with ZERO soreness. The next week or so I had a VERY mild headache (1 on a scale of 1-10) and a bit of dizziness but again, my anxiety causes this feeling too. I felt 95% from day 2 after getting my first shot on. 

Yesterday at 8:15AM after being EVEN MORE nervous for my 2nd shot, I received my 2nd Pfizer shot. I waited the 15 mins, went home and felt fantastic! I went for a 4 mile walk as it was gorgeous outside - came home and worked. Last night I took 1 Tylenol extra strength in preparation to wake up to feeling like I was hit by a truck. I slept great, woke up this morning and I am now 26 hours post vaccine and feel 100%! NO headache, NO fever, NO chills, no chest pains no dizziness no nausea, no fatigue...

I feel fantastic. 

I read that taking a good multivitamin and keeping hydrated helped, so that‚Äôs all I did in preparation of the shot. I am 31 and 155 pounds and have asthma and horrible seasonal allergies.

My husband, my sister in law, my mother in law, my father in law, my father, my best friend, my boss, my coworker, her boyfriend, and my nurse friend all felt the exact same way. NO issues with shot 2, or very MINOR issues like being sleepy or a mild headache. Maybe we are the lucky ones, but that‚Äôs 11 of us - all with minimal ANYTHING with both shots. 

Maybe shot two will still hit me later, but I am relieved and thankful.

UPDATE: I am now 56 hours (2.5) days post shot two - still no symptoms. Feel 100%!",lam09i,2021-04-10 16:34:29
"I‚Äôve had both injections, my second on Monday (today is Friday for those reading this at a later date). I‚Äôm a teacher who has been in-person since August with underlying health conditions, so any complaints I have take a backseat to the protection it affords.

First injection: got it in the afternoon with no initial symptoms other than some fatigue later that evening. The next morning I woke up and felt like I had fallen on a doorknob with the shoulder that received the shot, which is an atypical reaction for me when receiving vaccinations. I did my usual activities, including some light tree pruning, cursing my arm because it hurt but it didn‚Äôt hinder my activities greatly. The next morning that pain was gone and I had no other symptoms.

Second injection: noticed swollen lymph nodes under the injection arm that are sensitive to the touch. I may be running a slight temperature or I may be overheating easier. I‚Äôve had some mental health issues: increased anxiety and mood swings. My physiology is particularly sensitive to vaccines and medications in general (I don‚Äôt know why, my psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt know why‚Äîjust lucky, I guess /s). It‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt recognize and deal with, since I‚Äôve gotten used to living in this body with its many quirks. The random anxiety I have been experiencing is nothing compared to the panic I felt back in March when no one knew what the hell was going on.

10/10 would do it again.",lam09i,2021-02-26 11:13:15
"I got my first dose on Feb 3rd , and right after I didn't feel right, I got dizzy and just felt weird. It only got worse after that, that night I had hot flashes that lasted a couple days along with severe insomnia, which I'm still suffering from right now, after a few days with no sleep I started having hallucinations and by the 4th night my body just was too tired that I passed out but had horrendous super vivid nightmares, this cycle has been repeating itself till this day, then early last week I started feeling just unwell like something was seriously wrong with me, that feeling hasn't gone away yet but it's lessened the past day or so... Also last week I got the worst migraine of my life, it lasted two whole days, with NOTHING being able to quell it, idk if this was bc of the vaccine, I usually get 4 or 5 migraines a year and two Tylenol always takes it away quickly so idk, what do you guys think?... also I got nauseous the day after the vaccine but not too bad but that got worse, it wasn't until the 7th or 8th that my nausea started affecting my diet, on the 10th I got so nauseous I couldn't stomach anything at all, I had to force feed myself but with just a little bit a food, my stomach therefore, I assume, started hurting a lot... Since then (AND I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE HAS/IS EXPERIENCING THIS) my nausea comes and goes every day, for hours I'll be so sick but then I'll feel fine for a few hours and then it comes back full force. My symptoms really didn't start until several days after my first dose and just got progressively worse. I honestly thought I had or might have something serious going on, I just haven't heard of anyone having so many bad reactions to it for so long. Has/is anyone felt similar? If so it would really help ease my mind if you lmk so I know I'm not just stuck in bed bc of the vaccine or if I really need to go to the ER. If this is normal there's no way I can handle the second dose, no way in hell.",lam09i,2021-02-14 11:51:49
I just had my first dose tonight about 4 hrs ago. I‚Äôm already starting to feel tired. I also am starting to feel a slight pain in my arm. AND I have a random runny nose lol. That‚Äôs it so far.,lam09i,2021-02-05 02:40:46
"Hey everyone,

I had a lot of comfort and help from everyone posting observations on here and wanted to contribute.

I (20M) got my first dose 3 weeks ago. After getting it, I sat in the observation area for 15 minutes and didn‚Äôt feel much different (my arm didn‚Äôt even feel sore). I did feel tired, but it was towards the end of the work day.

During check out, they had me bring down my mask to check for rash/irritation. I had no symptoms in terms of that.

About 2-4 hours later, the inside of the arm that got jabbed started to feel itchy. It felt like my muscles were itching.

Right around that time I started to feel pretty tired. I fell asleep and woke up the next day feeling normal.

I felt normal since then. I was tired at points, but I usually feel tired due to poor sleep quality.

I got my second dose yesterday at 4:45PM. The process in the observation area was the same for me. Once again, I felt more tired, but it was towards the end of the work day.

I felt normal for afterwards. I went back to work and even did some physical activity after. I didn‚Äôt feel tired like the first one caused me to feel.

I went to sleep at around 12am and woke up at 4AM (12 hours from jab) with chills. Shortly after experiencing the chills, I had feelings of anxiety. 

The anxiety went away after a couple of minutes, but the chills persist. 

It is now 11:14am. I have chills (less intense), a headache (feels like when you sit on the couch for too long or go on the computer for too long), and slight dizziness.

I hope the symptoms end here and, in the end, am glad I had the opportunity to receive the vaccine. 

Good luck to everyone who received (or is receiving) the vaccine.",lam09i,2021-03-13 16:20:38
"I am 13 days out from first Pfizer shot. No real issues until about day 7, then started this persistent daily headache. I can‚Äôt get rid of it, tylenol etc does nothing. Since I do NOT have Covid it must be a reaction to antibodies but I can‚Äôt do my usual things with this pain. In researching Covid related headaches there are some NIH articles you can find, OTC things to reduce inflammation and even allergic-type response. I am hoping this headache stops soon‚Äî probably right before my second shot.
UPDATE:
My headache succumbed to Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine) and Salonpas small patches on my temples (menthol, camphor, etc, not the lidocaine ones altho my doctor recommended those too, as well as recommended nicotine patches). Anyway it stopped about two days before my second shot.
After my second shot I was flat out for 36 hours with body, joint pain, tiredness, and low grade fever. The next day I was mostly normal. Headache stayed on for four or five days but was able to knock it back with the Excedrin Migraine once a day. 
Two weeks out from the second Pfizer I am 100% back to normal.",lam09i,2021-02-25 19:03:52
"1st dose at 10:30AM today. Drove 20 miles to get Pfizer dose, not J&J.

I expect 2nd dose in 3 weeks to be like Prevnar13.

1st dose, fine.... 
Second dose kicks off imune system as a response to antibodies created by 1st dose.

Better than the alternative.",lam09i,2021-03-05 04:00:03
"Female, mid 40s, overweight, perimenopausal and otherwise healthy.

1st shot had sore arm at injection site immediately, achy and sore arm pit on the injection side, transient muscle aches, mostly on injection side of body. Insomnia. All lasted 4 days and resolved.

2nd shot. Sore arm at injection site. 4 hrs later, 100.3F fever. Mild fatigue. Entire arm and injection site soreness. 6 hrs the muscle aches started. By 8 hrs joint pain involved.  This lasted the next 24 hrs. Easily treated with Advil Dual (ibuprofen  + acetometaphin).

The first night, night severe diarrhea.  Like every hour for 6 hours. Didnt realize there was that much shit in the human body.

Woke on day 2 with sore and swelling lymph gland on the injection side arm pit. Can not wear a bra and tender to the touch. Muscle aches subsided. Joint pain more pronounced. 100F Fever transient, maybe 3 times spiked during the day. Diarrhea slowly decreased through mid afternoon and never reappeared. All aches treated with Dual Advil and hot Epsom salt bath. Insomnia persists.

Day 3. Aches subsided. No diarrhea. Fever gone. The under arm  swelling persists and is clearly visible. Injection site pain gone. Insomnia only half the night. Fatigue persists.

Days 4 to 6. Fatigue resolved. Only the underarm swelling persists but is  markedly decreasing in size. Minimal pain. No longer tender to the touch. Insomnia resolved by night 5. 

Day 7. Almost all side effects resolved. Armpit swelling gone and only tender under firm touch. No other side effects remain. 

It was a rough ride but would do again to avoid covid.",lam09i,2021-04-06 05:29:42
"My wife and I received our first dose March 3rd. I had been wanting to read other people's experiences because of a positive side effect I experienced. I will probably make a post of my own about this topic later. Anyhow, I had slight tiredness in my shoulder, but it lasted no more than an hour. My wife on the other hand, had soreness all day and felt sleepy. I was infused with a burst of energy. So, while she slept all evening I did chores around the house and went to Costco to get stuff we needed and still managed to work on things for my job well into the night (I'm a teacher). The next day I noticed I woke up with a rock hard erection, common I know, but lately my libido has been down. The pandemic has done a number on my overall health. I spend all day sitting at my desk teaching through Zoom or grading, or other stuff. I currently live a very sedentary life. That day, however, I made love to my wife 3 straight times. I hadn't done that in 20 years. I made love to her again the next day and the day after. She doesn't even want to see me in the bedroom anymore. My erections are completely hard and lasting which I can't say was the case prior to the vaccine. Has anyone had this experience?",lam09i,2021-03-08 08:04:38
"I have a history of chronic severe depression and anxiety. I received my second dose Saturday around 18:30. Sunday afternoon I experienced depression, apathy and suicidal idealation. I attempted research to see if it was vaccine related but didn't  have much luck. Has anyone else had this type of experience and if so how long did it last?",lam09i,2021-03-15 07:39:25
"So I received the vaccine on Tuesday 3/12. A couple of hours after the injection I was tired and had a little brain fog. That night (12 hours later) slight soreness at the injection site. The next day I had a little pain which quickly went away in my neck which may have been from the way I slept. Now 3 days later I feel fine and have no pain or soreness. Also, 4 other people in my house got the Pfizer vaccine and had the same experience as me. Just remember to use your arm after you get it. I am an EMT and have seen what this virus can do to people. I have spoken with my colleagues who had Covid and received the vaccine and they all said they would much rather deal with the side effects than get Covid again. I hope this helps any of you who are worried, nervous or on the fence about getting the vaccine.

Second dose update. So I received my second dose 4/6 it is now 4/14 and all I had was a sore arm, no fever and I was tired. The tiredness was probably just from my regular day to day. Also, before I went and got the second dose I made sure to be well hydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte. I am not sure if this helped but I have 6 family members who drank it and got their Pfizer vaccine with no reaction. Also, my parents and grandmother got Moderna and they did it as well and none of them had any reactions.I am not giving medical advice, I am just sharing my experience.",lam09i,2021-03-19 16:06:18
"One week later, I feel awful. Everything is exhausting me. I feel dizzy, I have a headache, rapid heartbeat, body aches and nausea. I haven‚Äôt felt like myself since. I‚Äôm also experiencing sudden depression.",lam09i,2021-03-24 02:00:05
"Wow, not sure I'm glad I came to this sub.  I had my first shot yesterday, I really have had no side effects.  About 45 minutes after I did have that feeling like a headache was going to start but it went away as quick as it came on.  I had heard some people were complaining about headaches...  My arm isn't sore, nothing.  While I am not downplaying anyone's personal experiences remember people are more apt to post complaints than they will positive experiences - it's just human nature. Don't let others feedback give your brain an opportunity to play tricks on you. We are all subject to subliminal messaging - it's everywhere these days!  I'm hoping everyone's side effects go away quickly and remember they can't be worse than being on a respirator or worse, 6 feet under.  Be glass is half full, not empty.  Positivity helps. Remember there are people in other countries that don't even have the opportunity to get vaccinated yet.  My stress levels have declined considerably and I'm looking forward to the 2nd shot and being able to get out of solitary confinement!",lam09i,2021-04-07 21:15:43
"21F. I got my vaccine at approximately 9:30am yesterday. It is currently 7:30am the next day and I feel so terrible it‚Äôs brought me to tears. At around 3pm-5pm the day of injection I got very tired, that could‚Äôve been unrelated. Then around 10pm I started feeling pain all over my body. It is hard to describe but it‚Äôs like an aching/needle pain in every single place in my body, and it is really bad along my back and neck and legs. I believe I have a fever but cannot find a thermometer. I was not able to sleep at all last night. I was turning around in bed constantly trying to find comfort, but with no success. My arm where the shot was given has the expected tenderness and pain but nothing compared to how the rest of my body feels. Now I just broke down in tears because of how much my body hurts. I‚Äôm at college and just want to be at home with my mom. I am so miserable.
Edited to add: with the first dose I only had very bad arm pain at the site of injection and no other symptoms.",lam09i,2021-04-08 13:42:10

"I did have what you are describing as well and felt like I was unable to properly work out because of tiredness.

My full experience was this: 
Vaccination date: first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine Sunday, 24th of January

I have a history of anaphylactic shocks (three) and I administered antihistamines before getting the shot as prevention. I did NOT have any allergic reaction to the vaccine in these conditions.

First 48hrs:
- sore muscle in my arm, where vaccine shot was
- slightly elevated body temperature (37.1)
- slight tiredness and body chills (kind of like when you are very early in catching a cold)
- a bit of nausea

10 days after vaccination:
- I have had trouble sleeping, but this might be attributed to having a stressful period",lam09i,2021-02-02 14:39:57
"Got my first dose yesterday. Within thirty minutes I had an elevated heart rate and BP, nausea and sweats. Stayed at clinic until everything went down. Within six hours had body aches and a headache. Now about one day after I have a tight throat and ache, body aches, chills and a low grade fever",lam09i,2021-02-05 19:15:39
"I just got my second dose Wednesday.

My first dose symptoms kicked in on day 2 and 3 the hardest. I felt waves of just... Feeling icky and fatigued, slightly nauseated. Pain in my armpit (weird but ok, didn't think much of it then)

2.5 weeks later
Second dose, much bigger reaction. Next day I'm feeling waves of Runny nose, chills, upset stomach, and fatigued. Then swelling started in my arm pit and the underside of my arm which received the injection.  Freaked out, I look it up and found that this is turning out to be a known side effect. Yesterday the swelling was big and slightly warmer to the touch, uncomfortable. I took tylenol and it helped WAY more than Ibuprofen did. Last night before bed the site got itchy and gave me some little hives but those went away. I slept in a bit extra and I'm feeling much better today, lymph swelling is way down. No icky waves yet.

I should mention I'm technically obese and have some skin problems like allergies to fragrances and psoriasis. I was eager to get the vaccine but feel kinda bummed it hit so hard. I want to encourage others to get it ASAP but want to be transparent that the side effects are a bit uncomfortable. If anyone has feedback for me I'm all ears.
Has anyone else had the swollen armpit???",lam09i,2021-02-07 18:53:25

I received my second dose this past Tuesday 2/16 and 30 hours later was hit with flu like symptoms including a 101 degree fever, terrible muscle aches, persistent upper stomach pain, nausea and extreme fatigue. Still battling all those except the fever. Oh and my arm really hurts where I got the shot. I usually have a high pain tolerance so the last part was surprising.

I began to feel run down (like I do when I have a cold) and went to bed early. Arm was sore through the night. 24 hours after vaccine the arm was less sore but still with moderate fatigue. Took some ibuprofen and felt better. Also very thirsty! 48 hours after, arm soreness and fatigue went away. However, about 55 hours after I began to feel fatigue and face flushing again. I am going to make it another early night to see if I can sleep it off! The side effects make me remember that my immune system is equipping itself to fight COVID. Grateful for the vaccine! Will report back on 2nd shot side effects.",lam09i,2021-02-20 03:23:21

1st dose‚Äîa breeze! Just pain in the arm. 

2nd dose‚ÄîWoke up with slight chills and body aches after receiving it the night before. As the day went on it got progressively worse. From about 11-630 I had really bad chills and body aches. It honestly felt like I had been in a car accident! It was very uncomfortable!! But as random as it came on, it also went away randomly! Around 630 I started feeling better. I slept about 9 hours that night and woke up the next day feeling fine! 

When I woke up I had barely any pain where I received the shot but I did have pain in my armpit for about 2 days! I checked and it said some people get pain there due to their lymph nodes!

I almost fainted in my car after receiving the shot. Thank goodness for a nice understanding nurse and an observation period because I hate needles!
Had a sore arm pretty much right away (expected that). Also was thirsty but was also expecting that. Was tired but ran small errands afterwards. 

12-24 hours after has felt kinda like a cold/flu or hangover. Been really tired and it‚Äôs been hard to focus but I worked. Pretty much have had a little nausea, intermittent 99 F, slight congestion I recognize from stress/allergies, and tiredness all day. Only taken tums for symptoms. 

Trying to go to bed much earlier than usual and hope it clears up soon!

"First Dose: Absolutely no reaction.

Second dose: 6-8 hours after vaccine, felt tired and slightly foggy- went to sleep.

12 hours after vaccine: woke up with body aches and a headache.  7/10 on pain scale each.

From this point, fever went between 99.9 F and 100.5 F for 18 hours- diminished appetite as well.

During this time, I was in bed- I would wake up with the head ache and body aches and I would have this need to stretch and move to try to ""escape the pain"" but there was no getting away from it this way.

Taking several hot showers really helped ease the body aches and even helped the head ache momentarily.

30 hours after vaccine: fever vanished, body aches and head ache went to a 2/10.  Got up and ate.

36 hours after vaccine: Head ache gone- body aches mostly gone (1/10)

48 hours after vaccine: Body aches gone- I noticed some of my lymph nodes on the side the shot was taken are sore.

Now, 66 hours after vaccine: Mostly back to normal- lymph nodes still sore.",lam09i,2021-03-07 15:36:33
"Received my first Pfizer dose yesterday (3/6) at about 2pm. Felt annoyed by the Pharma technician administering the shot because he wanted to make conversation and I just wanted to get it over with. Sat for 15 minutes afterwards and felt increased heart rate, but I think this was mainly adrenaline coursing through my body since I was feeling anxious about the vaccine. I had a dizzy spell about 30 minutes afterward and light nausea (still think this was due to adrenaline) and asked my sister to take me home so I could rest. My arm started getting sore about 2-3 hours afterwards, and I did notice feeling some pressure/congestion in my left ear and nostril. 

I‚Äôve been drinking lots of water and stretching and flexing my arm as recommended by the pharma tech to keep the deltoid supple. The next morning my arm still felt sore but less painful than the day before. No other side effects of note yet, but feeling so far so good!",lam09i,2021-03-08 03:20:57
"So I got the first shot of Pfizer, yesterday at 10am. Didn‚Äôt feel the shot go in, no pain at all. Then at around 3pm I noticed my arm was like sore and hurt to touch. By 10pm, I couldn‚Äôt sleep on the arm, moving it hurt, no rash but it felt very swollen. That same night, I woke up at 2am with chills and a low grade fever. I‚Äôve been taking Tylenol every 6 hours for pain and the fever. It‚Äôs helped some, but it is now 10pm and my arm hurts slightly less but I‚Äôm noticing the pain is more spread out. I felt it up around my armpit and travel down my side by my rib cage. I‚Äôve been in and out of sleep and the chills come back around the 6 hour mark of when I take another two of Tylenol. I‚Äôve been very fatigued and nauseous today as well. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to get the second vaccine only because of the side effects. I may wait a few months and ask my doctor what I should do since the vaccine clearly is giving me a lot of pain. Did anyone else experience this or experience something else? And did you end up skipping the second dose because of this????",lam09i,2021-03-08 06:56:26
"Had my first dose 2 days ago. Felt normal afterwards, decided to walk home. 

Yesterday, arm was a little tender and some irritability (but I won‚Äôt blame that second part on the vaccine haha). 

Today felt normal, even went for a light jog. Came back home, took a shower, and then started experiencing slight chest pain (like someone punched me) and an elevated heart beat, over 100 while laying in bed. 3hrs after the run.",lam09i,2021-03-08 20:35:29
"Dose 1 today at 10:00am. Arm started getting sore within the hour. 10.5 hrs later feels like the soreness from a tetanus shot. It feels better if I keep it moving.

 At about 1:30pm started experiencing a random muscular ache here and there on the injection side of the body. First the random neck spasm, shoulder to bicep, underarm, and now the  shin and calf area. 

Other than that, so far so good.",lam09i,2021-03-09 04:33:41
"So I got my shot on Friday 26th of Feb, im a type 1 diabetic as well so I hope any info below helps people.

First 12h after jab.

My arm hurt like properly hurt and felt heavy but didn't feel that bad. Blood sugar wise my control was average, no extremes.

12 - 48h

My arm was sore internally and I felt like crap, I noticed my sugars kept sky rocketing then crashing which is odd. 

48h to 72.

Major hankering for protein, donno why I just needed meat, the pain in my arm was subsiding and I could finally sleep on it.

72 h to One week on

So after about 72h my arm stopped hurting and all of the feeling like crap ended. However, I did notice that my bloods kept crashing, for about 2 days solid day 6 and 7 no matter what I did I could not get my sugars up, so I had hypos (low blood sugars) after hypos especially during the day.

Anyway I hope the above helps.",lam09i,2021-03-09 07:54:25
"I got both shots.  The first one made my very arm sore for a week.  The second one made me feel like I had a flu coming on and made me more tired than usual for 2 days. My arm stayed sore for a week. In all, I would much rather experience these side effects than take my chances unvaccinated against COVID19.",lam09i,2021-03-09 18:56:01
"Today is Tuesday. First shot was Friday night, so four days ago. Initial reaction was just sore arm/neck area and some fatigue. But starting Monday evening, my heart rate shoots up when I just walk a few steps. After walking up or down the stairs I feel wiped out and my heart rate is like 110 or higher. My chest is tightening and painful. Today was ok but got worse and I had to just lie down and not move to get my heart rate down. I have asthma and took a few hits off my inhaler but it didn‚Äôt help for chest tightness. This is a really weird feeling because my lungs feel as if I‚Äôm recovering from a massive coughing event (feels ‚Äúbruised‚Äù and tight) but the ‚Äúevent‚Äù never happened, just the tightness and discomfort. I‚Äôm not obese; I could loose a few but still ‚Äúnormal weight‚Äù. I‚Äôm used to walking and yoga so my problems with the stairs aren‚Äôt due to pre-vaccine factors.

It's now Tuesday night at 9 (\~30 hours after) and I've been a bit ""off"" today. Taking it easy & nibbling crackers has helped.

"First shot yesterday 3/10. 
Within the first hour: sore throat with lump in the throat feeling on the right side when I swallowed. 

Hours 1-8: headachey, fatigued, but not too bad. Sore throat went away at some point. 

Last night: Arm started to get really sore. Had trouble falling asleep, achy body/sensitive skin started happening. Woke up in the middle of the night with chills, turned up the heater. Partner said it was really hot but I kept complaining I was freezing. 

Today: no energy, achy body and sensitive skin feeling has persisted. Cancelled my one client for the day because I have zero energy to give to another person right now. Also I keep sneezing, which is unlike me (never get allergies, etc). Like someone has said, feels like a seasonal cold but without the mucus symptoms.",lam09i,2021-03-11 16:51:02

When I woke up from my 3 hour nap, my whole body was stiff. Later that night I had a strange cough. Smaller side effects were some itching and a small rash around the injection site. 

Didn't get a headache and a lil nausea until the next day. Overall soreness went away and now it's just the arm. Still having that weird cough and some tiredness.",lam09i,2021-03-12 03:35:01
"Ello chums, got my first Pfizer vaccine 7 days ago and here is my experience so far:

Slight soreness in arm as expected, nothing crazy.

Day 2: had a sudden flash of fatigue, I was at work and felt stupid, could barely answer customer questions. Had my gf drive me home cus I didn‚Äôt feel safe to drive a car. Got home, watched a movie and 4 hours after the onset it cleared up it was really strange.

Day 3: no symptoms

Day 4: right at the end of the night felt ‚Äúnot good‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on what it was, drank a bunch of water and switched to a relaxing activity and that seemed to clear it up

Day 5: Woke up fine, I noticed my appetite was a bit suppressed and wasn‚Äôt able to eat much. Later in the night developed headache/chills/ and felt like the discomfort of a fever but not actually running hot. The night was rough, took many hot showers and sat in front of my mini heater most the time to satisfy the chills. Finally fell asleep and slept through till about 7am next day.

Day 6: Woke up a little more nauseated than the day before so had myself some alka seltzer (felt like a hang over) and immediately went back to bed cus of fatigue. Woke up around 11:00 am and though I was feeling better which was nice cus I was running behind on schoolwork so I was able to focus and get some of it done. Still had no appetite, could only intake liquids like water/smoothie/ and for some reason a banana was accepted by my body. Thought everything was groovy except around 6pm got hit with another wave of fatigue/headache/chills which sucked. Took an ibuprofen 200mg but stomach got upset because I haven‚Äôt been eating so no dice.Went back to the hot showers and heating fan and eventually fell asleep but felt very hot all night.

Day 7(today): Woke up feeling pretty normal, again got a banana down and a smoothie, tried some toast but no dice. Was able to get some more school work done but then again around 6pm hit by a wave of this fatigue/headache/nausea but definitely not as bad as the previous nights. Still haven‚Äôt been able to eat much which is also contributing to my headache and fatigue but drinking lots of water and also pedialyte seemed to help. This time took a ibuprofen 200mg again but tried to fill my stomach as much with water to avoid nausea and it seems to have helped, I‚Äôve kind of snapped out of my ‚Äúchills‚Äù state. 

I am 25 M, and don‚Äôt use any drugs or drink alcohol, I also don‚Äôt take any daily medications accept Claritin. I tried to provide as much details as possible to give those considering getting the vaccine an idea of my experience.

Helpful Notes:
If you‚Äôre gunna take hot showers, make sure to drink LOTS of water so you don‚Äôt get dehydrated .

Drink plenty of water.

If your appetite is messed up like mine try to eat liquid foods that have calories so your body has something to work with (applesauce/smoothie) or whatever your body agrees with. Any amount of nutrients gives your body what it needs to fight off the invader (vaccine).

Try small doses of Ibuprofen if you can.

Hope this helps!",lam09i,2021-03-12 04:38:42
"I had my first dose exactly one week ago. I felt mostly fine other than muscle soreness at the injection site and the mildest of headaches. I felt slightly more tired than usual but I‚Äôm a shift worker (and health care worker) and I just chalked it up to that. Today my headache was worse and I felt really fatigued. I called work and got a covid test. Negative. I also have some abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite and now a very mild sore throat. I thought the period of side effects had passed but I guess not. I‚Äôm not looking forward to the second dose.",lam09i,2021-03-12 05:32:15
"I had an antibody test about a month ago which came back positive meaning I had a mostly asymptomatic infection of Covid at some point. 

&#x200B;

I had heard that people previously infected can experience the stronger reaction from the first shot of the vaccine that most people experience after the second shot.

&#x200B;

It seems that was the case. I had the shot Tuesday afternoon and it is now Friday afternoon. Tuesday night I was more tired than normal and went to bed much earlier than normal. Wednesday, woke up in the morning after a rare 8 hours of sleep and still felt very tired and sleepy. Had a weird ""reverberating"" headache, different from the tension headaches I normally get. This was the type that hurts more when you cough or bend over.

Luckily this type of headache seemed to respond to pain relievers a lot more than my tension headaches normally do, so I made sure to stay on my doseage of alternating acetaminophen / ibuprofen. Took a nap Wednesday afternoon. After that, went out to buy a coffee and the clouds seemed to dissipate and I started feeling great from almost exactly 24 hours after the shot.

&#x200B;

Then the next day, Thursday, yesterday, I felt great, until the end of the day. I may have ""pushed it"" by going for a walk in the evening, after which I felt totally drained, which was concerning for me and weird. I went to bed early again last night. Seems like day two of symptoms was much more mild though, as I didn't have headache or chills or anything, just felt tired and sleepy.

&#x200B;

Today is Friday and I'm feeling great so far. Don't think I will go to the gym for a few days, just to be safe and save my energy. 

&#x200B;

I did not experience any nausea and the pain/swelling of the injection site was even less than I normally get from the flu vaccine.

&#x200B;

**Question:**

I've been trying to find (even anecdotal) information online about this but it's hard to find. I know the reaction to the first shot is expected to be bigger for those who had prior Covid infections. How does this fare for the second shot? Should I expect a similar reaction? A bigger one? A smaller one?",lam09i,2021-03-12 22:24:15

All resolved within three-ish days. But now, two weeks later those symptoms have returned. Wondering if anyone has had their symptoms come back later one. Same side, exactly the same pain level, etc. Very strange!

I'm absolutely dreading the second one, though.

"Right after the injection, I felt fine. Not much soreness around the injection site. However at night, I began to feel the soreness around the injection site.

The second day after getting the vaccine, I felt fine in the morning and got plenty of sleep (approximately 8 hours or more). But I suddenly felt very sleepy around 4pm. Also throughout the day, my injection arm was quite sore and I avoided to lift my arm up and stop exercising. 

Today is my third day after getting the vaccine, my head feels heavy and i feel like I‚Äôm kinda in a daze almost.

"Hi all, I had my second Pfizer vaccination 10 days ago. Felt fine until about 12 hours later, then it kicked me in the pants so to speak. I was told that at 62 year old I might expect mild side effects. Not at all mild for me. My arm was a only mildly sore but I became extremely lightheaded... like I had a couple bottles of wine without being buzzed. Rather I had sort of stoned feeling and not a good stoned like the last time I used drugs in the 1980‚Äôs lol.  I was moving about badly, could not walk a straight line to save my life. That persisted and very slowly diminished over 7-8 days. I also had chills and sweating for about 3-4 days. Muscle aches and pain ramped up and have just now started to subside. Nasty headache for 2 days, significant lethargy and fatigue still occurs. Also became a bit cranky and depressed which are quite unusual for me. Crankiness is gone, depression remains as does muscle pain. Bottom line is this, it has kicked my ass. Is it worth it, yes. I‚Äôve had numerous friends become ill with Covid, another friend is in the VA ICE as I write this. Also have lost 2 acquaintances to Covid. Let‚Äôs all hope and pray that there are not long term consequences to the vaccine. There are no long term studies so far, they are sure to begin appearing at some point. I‚Äôm betting there will be some long haulers who endure side effects but time will tell. All in all, I‚Äôm glad I have been vaccinated. As I ‚Äújoked‚Äù  with my wife while we  were watching I Am Legend and awaiting vaccination, ‚Äúwe are either going to be one of the zombies or 2 of the people being chased down by the zombies‚Äù I am of course being facetious, nothing like would ever occur.

Previous day I drank a lot of water and cranberry juice and I must say my experience this time was not too dissimilar from the first I would say my arm didn‚Äôt get anywhere near as sore but the fatigued has lingered for a few days after. Anyways glad to get all that done.,lam09i,2021-04-14 16:58:53

"**Shot 1: March 25**

8 hours after shot - Sore arm and fatigue develop

12 hours after shot - A headache develops

12-40 hours after shot - the sore arm, fatigue and headache stick around

40-48 hours after shot - symptoms begin to fade

4 days after shot - lymph nodes on side of injection begin to swell and become painful in neck, collar bone, armpit and breast

21 days after shot - lymph nodes still swollen and painful in areas with a hard ""ball"" about the size of a nickel in collarbone lymph node

&#x200B;

**Shot 2: April 15**

1 hour after shot -  no symptoms to report yet

9-11 hours after shot - arm goes from very slight pain to the level it peaked at from first shot; no other symptoms

12-18 hours after shot - a new side effect I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere before and it may be unrelated...but sleep apnea hit hard, something I haven‚Äôt felt in years. And I was not really able to sleep throughout the night. Has seemed to fade though. 

12 hours after shot to now - faint headache, body aches and skin hurts to touch (updated 4/16 at 11:25am - will continue to update as time passes)",lam09i,2021-04-15 18:57:00
"1st shot had zero side affects and 2nd shot gave me a headache overnight, fine by the morning

I think people who read these threads need to understand people who get it and don't have any major side effects aren't going to post about it very often so please take these people with a grain of salt as it is very unlikely

Also, some of these comments are made by anti-vax accounts so please watch what you read",lam09i,2021-04-21 16:03:00
"Just got my second dose of Pfizer vaccine yesterday AM.  It's been almost 36 hours and feel nothing. Zero side effects.  There was a bit of very mild arm soreness yesterday, but today it is no more.  I could even do lateral shoulder raises with decent weights.

Is this normal? Does that mean the vaccine didn't work?  Was I given a bad quality/expired vaccine?  

I recall after my first doze I had some arm soreness and little bit of headache in the night. I was expecting to be hit by a truck in dose 2.  But nothing happened.  Not sure if I'm still protected..",lam09i,2021-04-22 00:52:59

My left arm where I had my shot is achy but it‚Äôs not too bad. I do have a wicked headache though. I‚Äôm trying to stay hydrated and rest when I can. Am I allowed to take aspirin? Man, this is wicked...",lam09i,2021-04-23 00:21:31
"Got my second dose of Pfizer last night. Today, I've felt chills, fever, joint pain, even vomit. Supposedly, these are symptoms  that you have a strong immune system and that the Vaccine is working. Everyone is different, but I would avoid working the next day you get second dose.",lam09i,2021-04-23 01:47:09
"I'm so glad I found this thread! I got my first Pfizer dose on April 10th (13 days ago) and I'm so tired all the time, I can barely function.

I sleep 12 hours a night, every night.

I've managed only 1 run since the jab, and it was less than 2 miles. Normally I run 3 - 4 miles, 4 times a week. I also normally do ~3 hours of strength training every week. So far I've only managed 1 15-minute session.

After each of these mini-workouts, I was so tired that I was totally bedridden the next day.

I have a mountain of laundry to do, my floors need vacuuming, and I can't do any of it because I'm so goddamn tired all the time.

Yesterday I went shopping at CVS for about 45 minutes. It's only 6 blocks from my house. I took a 2-hour nap when I got home.

I'm just glad I'm still unemployed, because I can't imagine trying to explain to a boss that I can't come in to work for weeks on end because I'm ""tired.""

I'm now terrified of getting the second shot, since the side effects are supposed to be worse after the second dose. I'm worried that I'm going to waste the whole summer in bed.

I've done endless Google searches on this topic, but can find nothing. Everything I've read says that the side effects should be gone in a few days. Nobody seems to believe me when I tell them I'm still feeling like shit every day.

ETA: Started feeling better a few days after I posted this comment. Got my second Pfizer shot on 5/1/21. Pain/swelling at injection site was much worse than with the 1st shot, but only lasted 36 - 48 hours. I also experienced fatigue and nausea, just like last time, but the symptoms were maybe like 10% of the hell I experienced after the 1st shot. 

Other commenters here said that if your 1st shot symptoms are really bad, your 2nd shot symptoms are likely to be mild. I have no idea if that's really true overall, but it was certainly true for me. My arm hurt a lot, and I was kinda tired/nauseous for the first couple days, but it went away very quickly compared to last time, and I feel 100% now (""now"" meaning the evening of 5/7/21).",lam09i,2021-04-23 21:58:58
"Got my second dose last Friday (4/30) and DAMN, that shit knocked me on my ass. üòÇ I went from gloating to my bf about being invincible to a shivering, sweaty little bee-yotch hours later. I read about the ‚Äú24-hour post-vaccine flu‚Äù so much but going through it was a weird experience and I regret nothing!!

**Long version if anyone cares:**

‚Ä¢ First dose, I had a super sore arm, nothing else. Got my second shot midday Friday and fell asleep feeling great. 

‚Ä¢ Woke up 10 hours after my shot in a pool of sweat and discomfort. Really thought I could outsmart Pfizer by falling asleep on it. I forced myself out of bed to pee and almost stopped mid-stream to throw-up. Was at that level of discomfort and nauseousness where you just land on the bed and put little effort into anything beyond that. 

‚Ä¢ Woke up confused, sweaty, hot, cold, and feverish all at once. Had *super* vivid dreams. Also my head hurt in a very unique, shitty way. Popped an excederin and continued to sleep as much as possible. Any awake periods were confusing, sweaty, hot, cold and feverish. 

‚Ä¢ Night rolled around and I did the unspoken, drank NyQuil. I truly believe this vaccine no-no saved me and gave me a beautiful, healing slumber.

‚Ä¢ Day 2 Post-Pfizer: I woke up feeling brand new (still slightly sweaty). Felt amazing all day, honestly, I feel better than before‚Ä¶ like my body hit reset. Still unnecessarily sweaty tho.",lam09i,2021-05-03 03:58:06
"I don't understand why people would express regret about getting the vaccine.  There are stories on Reddit of people having Covid for 5 months and having to take blood thinners their whole life.  I cannot get Covid, it would be dangerous for me.  But even seemingly young and healthy people have gotten very sick with Covid and died.  So to me, risking Covid instead of getting the vaccine is like playing Russian roulette.  You are betting on the fact that A) you won't get a bad case of it and B) you won't have nasty side effects that will dog you the rest of your life.  What a terrible bet.  And plus the future variants are just going to be nastier and harder to overcome.  The sooner we stamp out the contagion the better.

The vaccine seems so much safer.  I had both doses and I'm so relieved, I can't even tell you.  I can rejoin life again soon, to some extent.  I am a tiny bit more tired at times but I'm not the least bit concerned about a small trade off like that.  I had a fever and chills for a day and a half with my second dose.  I just stayed in and slept it off and drank a lot of water and electrolytes.  Seems a small price to pay for not getting severe illness and massive hospital bills, if I even did manage to survive Covid, if I contracted it.",lam09i,2021-05-06 16:13:28
I'm planning to get my first dose tomorrow. Hope it doesn't react too bad since I already get tired very easily and I have past history of occasional mild bronchitis.,lam09i,2021-05-12 22:26:43
"So... I just had my second dose on Sunday at 5pm.
I was already quite fatigued from finals and family time but around midnight I began to feel like I had the ‚Äúbody flu‚Äù- aches and general joint discomfort. Slept for roughly 12 hours which was honestly nice and way over due for the semester.

Monday I had an elevated temp (usually 97.8) at 99.6 F. Aside from feeling the fever and aches I woke up Tuesday as if nothing had happened.

I can‚Äôt 100% claim my tiredness is post vax effects because my period starts this week and I also take other medications that can influence my fatigue levels dependent on my hormones.

Arm pain with first dose was actually way more uncomfortable than the second. I didn‚Äôt feel the first injection when it happened, but the second one felt like a nerve got hit... like a light shock, but not unbearable.

I am physically very sensitive and feel unwell easily but the vaccine was ALOT easier than I initially anticipated.
All in all I‚Äôm grateful I was able to get the vaccine and Pfizer has a good track record (medically speaking) stay hydrated and plan to get the second one with a day or two off work. 

Stay safe everyone!",lam09i,2021-05-13 02:45:10
"Had my first Pfizer shot 3 weeks ago. Was fine the first day except my period started, very early and unexpectedly, about 5 hours after the shot. Day two I felt like I was in a car accident and had whiplash from my shoulder to the heel of my foot but only on one side. Day 3 I had a sore arm and some body stiffness and thought I was on the mend. Day 4 I woke up with a crushing pain around my ribs, like I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath but not. Took my blood pressure and O2 Sat and they were fine so I took some Tylenol and went to sleep. Day 5 my lymph nodes in my neck and armpits were swollen and the skin over them was sore to the touch (still is sometimes). Day 6 the headaches started. Called my doc on day 7 and she refused to see me and told me to go to the ER because I had left sided (shot side) shoulder and back pain. Sat there for 8 hours and had an EKG, heart ultrasound, 2 rounds of blood tests and an X-ray checking for blood clots and heart attack. Came back clean but with very low potassium. Was told it‚Äôs probably shot side effects, my immune response was probably crazy and that they should subside. I‚Äôve had constant headaches, random dizzy spells, cold hands and feet like something is wrong with my circulation, profound fatigue all day long and terrible left side shoulder blade pain that gets worse with movement. The newest thing that started happening about 5 days ago is that my arms feel heavy. Like I have been lifting super heavy weights everyday except I never recover. It‚Äôs so tight and I can‚Äôt figure out why. I am scheduled to get shot 2 tomorrow but I don‚Äôt think I can do it. Wtf is happening to me? Has anyone else had any similar issues? Do I risk it and get the second one in hopes that I ‚Äúreset‚Äù? Or do I wait until I feel better to get it?",lam09i,2021-05-13 04:59:31
"Wanted to post this in the general subreddit but I‚Äôm not allowed to post anything. Has anyone experienced heart palpitations after the vaccine? I have a hypothyroid and started getting palpitations after being over medicated a few years ago. Now I will randomly get palpitations here and there- they‚Äôre mild but I do notice them. After I got my 2nd dose of Pfizer this morning, I was having palpitations for a few minutes- they were noticeable enough where I was like ‚Äúoof if this doesn‚Äôt stop I should call my dr‚Äù and they have since died down. I just feel a little off now, but was wondering if anyone else had experience with heart palpitations after their 2nd dose. Thanks in advance for the responses!",lam09i,2021-05-13 22:18:14
I got the Pfizer vaccine today and instant reaction. Like numbness and tingling in the face and arms. The doctor on site monitored me for a hour and told me if it gets worse to go to emergency. It's been 4 hours and my lips and face are still numb. Apparently this is a common side effect. I was told this was the safest vaccine for women. I don't think I'd recommend this one üòí,lam09i,2021-05-14 19:57:29
"I‚Äôm a 28 yr old Female I just received my second Pfizer shot this morning at 9:13am. I was feeling fine after the 15 mins so I left. About 30 mins later my ear on my right side( same side I got my shot in both this and last time) is in pain again. It was the same reaction after the first shot and didn‚Äôt go away until the night before my 2nd shot. I have a slightly sore arm, and I did have 1 dizzy spell. I took a nap for 6 hours afterwards and now I‚Äôm just resting. I hope that my ear pain goes away soon...

Edit: Day 2. I‚Äôm just waking up after being in bed sleep since 10 pm last night. That‚Äôs a lot of hours sleeping, but my ear is still in pain. Feels congested.

"2nd post.

Seasonal allergies.

First shot: Tired, weak arm, sore spot on arm, sleepy at random times, 1 week in everything feels fine with minor migraines. Could not lift my table/wood I was working on. 2 wks in, I'm feeling normal but with one weird thing. My left ear went deaf for a good half of day in the week 2. Everything hears muffled one side but my right hears fine. Hearing is back to normal 2 days later.

Second report:

Got my second shot yesterday. Arm is not sore from the shot only the spot where the needle entered. I was awaiting for my side effects that are similar to the first where I was tired and weak but nothing. Eyes get droopy from reading so I took two hour nap. Woke up and felt nothing similar to the first dose. No sore arm or tiredness side effects like the first dose. Then some thing occurred after having lunch. Stomach growled nothing serious and went to use the restroom. Two hours later, Stomach gurgled and had to use the restroom again. I counted 5-6 trips to the restroom for number 2. Still no other side effects like the first. Today I had breakfast and had to go number 2 twice this morning. All solid beside one Diarrhea.  So far no other side effect. Might take a nap and report in if there are other symptoms.",lam09i,2021-05-15 21:14:34
"Has anyone had pins and needles after first dose or second? It started yesterday, my heart rate was pretty high and I kept getting pins and needles before bed. It lasted throughout the night and I woke up twice still feeling it a bit and my left arm was sore.

I'm getting pins and needles again mostly in my feet but also in my hands too today as well. It comes and goes and isn't constant but it's often enough to make me worry what it is. Today is the 7th day after getting my first dose.

ANYONE share if you've had this too.",lam09i,2021-05-18 05:32:36
"the area where the needle entered my arm was in a subtle and extremely tolerable pain state for 2-3 days max. I have received both shots.

"I just got my first dose yesterday about 23 hours ago. 

I did get vagal response but that isn‚Äôt due to the vaccine‚Äôs contents. The shot didn‚Äôt hurt at all. I didn‚Äôt even feel it. Nurse says I need to be lying down next time. A bit embarrassing to nearly faint but oh well. Can‚Äôt do anything about that. 

No real symptoms or side effects. My arm hurts today. Feels like I got punched really hard in the arm, but it‚Äôs not intrusive. I‚Äôve pulled my deltoid before lifting and it‚Äôs very similar. 

I feel a little tired on day 2 but I‚Äôm drinking lots of water and protein.

Update: have felt great since. At the gym today May 28, was lifting my usual weight with no issues.",lam09i,2021-05-26 15:58:03

I wanted to share my experience so far. I got my shot on 2/5.  Felt fine afterwards but day 2 my legs and feet started to get a tingly/pins and needles feeling and it‚Äôs been like that ever since (today is 2/11). I‚Äôm getting weird ticks and twitch‚Äôs in my legs too. I do CrossFit and I havent been unable to go back. I get so tired during the day after doing something simple like walk my dogs.

Today the injection site hurts a lot if something brushes against it, I have a mild headache on-and-off, more fatigue, and way more nausea. Just feeling very flu-ish.

"5 days after my first Pfizer vaccine I started getting small waves of dizziness. 3 days after that they became severe and the vomiting started. It was so bad I could not even stand up and could not stop throwing up. Husband actually had to call 911! Was admitted and given fluids and anti nausea. I could not even open my eyes forv2 days without throwing up. Cat scan. MRI, blood work all ok. 
Dr said could very well be vertigo brought on by vaccine even though no live virus in vaccine your body doesn't know that. There is a viral type of vertigo. 
Went for second vaccine since doc said better than getting covid. I actually had two days feeling better after 2nd shot but now back to waves of dizziness but thankfully no nausea. 
Some episodes put me in bed, bad ringing in ears and feeling like crap. Tinnitus is constant but gets worse with bad dizzy spells. 
Doc prescribed Meclizine but it makes me feel worse and does nothing for dizziness.
It's been a month of this now! Very difficult to work. Can't even walk the dog! I spend most of my day working in bed on my laptop. I just try to cram everything I need to do in between waves. I'm pretty tough and have been fighting through but it is really getting hard not to cry! To top it all off, I am also packing the house to move next week 18 hrs away! Can't even drive so hubby will have to take full brunt.

"I just took my second shot 36 hours ago. My experience was as follows:

First shot-
 - Very sore arm at injection site for the first 48 hours that went away. 
- mild brain fog during the frost 24 similar to a fly shot in my experience

Second shot
- mild and persistent headache for the first 6 hours
- 10 hours after the shot was incredibly tired and went to bed
- woke up about 18 hrs after the shot with mild chill and thirst. Just drank water and went back to bed and injection site was sore similar to the first shot but not nearly as bad (also slept on that side so could be something)
- slept another 6 hours
- woke up still lethargic and mild headache (fortunately took off work) 
- muscle soreness throughout the day. Nothing horrible just feels like I worked out the day before but did not. 
- mild heachache off and on. 

Overall it feels like the tail end of the flu with some soreness and lethargy and a mild headache. It‚Äôs really not as bad as I expected and well worth it for immunity against the potential short and long term effects of covid (since we don‚Äôt know how it will effect each person). 

Overall I‚Äôm incredibly appreciative and elated to have the opportunity to be vaccinated. Still another 10 days or so to build up immunity but thrilled and these minor side effects that I experienced are well worth it. Four coworkers vaccinated at the same time had similar symptoms. Headache, soreness, chills first night, lethargy for 48 hours or so, seem to be common.

Thanks and stay safe!",lam09i,2021-02-25 20:20:43
"Hello, the next two days after my second pfizer dose (end of January) I broke out in itchy acne on my face and under my chin, this has lasted for weeks  really itchy and easily irritated by mask, face washing ect...I hadn't changed my skincare routine at all.  It seems to be fungal acne (Malassezia folliculitis). Has anyone else had this type of reaction ?",lam09i,2021-02-25 20:27:59

I got mine today about three and a half hours ago. On my drive home I started feeling really tired. As soon as I got home I took a nap and actually just woke up and decided to see if fatigue and exhaustion/nausea was a common symptom. Thanks for this thread for putting my mind at ease,lam09i,2021-02-27 19:36:40
"Been experiencing similar symptoms to what I've been reading here, which makes me feel a bit better today since I'm not alone in this. A little background on me: I'm 38 (m) non smoker, extremely active run/workout 5/6 days a week, fairly healthy balanced diet, no known prexisting conditions. 

Got my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday (2/20). No immediate effects noticed. 

Day 1 - Sunday: Arm soreness, nothing else 

Day 2 - Monday: I feel fine, back to normal. Arm soreness gone. Was able to workout without a problem.

Day 3 - Tuesday: Tuesday evening began to develop a fever. Had chills and cold sweats. Fever went to 102 F.

Day 4 - Wednesday: Fever was up and down, started to develop a sore throat, minor congestion. At this point I was convinced that I caught Covid based on symptoms and went and got tested. Had very low energy and continued to sleep throughout most of the day. 

Day 5 - Thursday: No fever today, but still very lethargic and low energy. Sore throat persists. Results from Covid test came back negative. 

Day 6 - Friday: My body still feels run down. Attempted to workout. It was a struggle and felt like I was working out hungover. Also developed a headache which seemed to be concentrated behind my eyes. Low grade fever (99F) and still super tired. Sore throat isn't as bad as the day before.

Day 7 - Saturday: Slept 13 hours and headache still persists. Sore throat seems to be gone but I'm still low energy and running a low fever (99F). Have not moved from bed. 

I'm thankful to have the vaccine but coincidentally had a week off from work. I couldn't imagine going to work and being productive with these symptoms. If the second dose is allegedly worse, I do not look forward to it. 

Side note: I have been reporting my symptoms to the daily V-safe texts that I get from the CDC.",lam09i,2021-02-27 21:07:52
"I got my first dose on Saturday. My arm is really sore, and I had lower energy than normal today with dull aches all over, but I generally feel fine. I know that the 2nd dose is likely to be worse. I have MS, and I have to give myself interferon injections every week. Those cause the flu-like symptoms, which are pretty well managed with ibuprofen, and this doesn‚Äôt feel as bad as when I forget to take ibuprofen.",lam09i,2021-03-01 04:41:40
"30/f I got my first dose Sunday 
I had COVID in the beginning of January
So far have had off/on nausea",lam09i,2021-03-01 19:51:48
"I received both doses as of 26th. The first dose was restricted to side effects of just pain at the injection site. I would rate it as moderate that lasted about 24 hours tops. Then all good. The second one had side effects very similar except far worse. My injection site was very sore that night (took my shot at 1:45PM). To the point that it kept me up late and I couldn't sleep on that side at all. I didn't take any pain meds just so I didn't reduce the efficacy. The next day the pain persisted, with redness and swelling and didn't reduce at all. I also had a small headache (less than moderate), just a small throb on and off. The following day, more of the same but with the shoulder pain reduced to moderate and below. Still a very small head throb every now and again. But now it is Mar 1st and I feel totally recovered. My shoulder feels the shot if I press against it but otherwise it is fine. Hope this is helpful.",lam09i,2021-03-02 02:26:45
"Got mine first dose yesterday, Feb 28. Will update as long as I have effects, and when I receive the second dose. 

For reference: I typically have a reaction to flu shots. In 2018, I ended up swelling, bruising, and getting a rash, whereas most years I only get minor swelling and ache, and maybe a slight immune response ‚Äúlike the flu‚Äù. To be fair, I typically also get colds around the same time, I tend to get sick the week in October the same week I schedule my vaccine. I have had some reactions (mostly the swelling) to medications/injections, so I was required to wait for 30 mins post injection. 

Day 1, immediately post dose: absolutely nothing, I barely even felt the needle. 

Day 1, up to 6 hours: if anything, just tired. I had a 2 hour ride to the site I went to, and 2 hours back. Both in the pouring rain, about 40¬∞F. Didn‚Äôt eat til fairly late, and over ate at lunch. Could be many things. Ended up sleeping from 6pm until 9pm. 

Day 1, approx 8 hours post dose: arm started to get sore. This was about 10pm. Continued to get more sore overnight, ended up rolling onto arm while sleeping, which woke me up. 

Day 2: all day arm is pretty sore, sometimes for just pressure, sometimes it‚Äôs a constant sore. Guess depends on what I‚Äôm doing. Just spent approx. 2 hours meal prepping for the week, cutting veg and cooking, so it is a bit sore just from constant moving. It‚Äôs now 24 hours since soreness started (32 hours post dose) and I just took band aid off. No visible bruising/swelling etc.

Day 3: 48 hours later, soreness finally wore off. Small bruise, but no swelling. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs the end of dose 1 side effects!",lam09i,2021-03-02 03:11:32
Three hours into my first shot. Only a small amount of pain in arm so far. I feel fine otherwise. I was quite nervous and had some anxiety right after injection but felt better in about 20 min. That‚Äôs not unusual for me and my history with anxiety. I will let you know how it progresses.,lam09i,2021-03-02 04:05:36
"Got the vaccine on 2/18- sore arm, nausea, headache, and fatigue shortly after. 1 day later my arm was still sore and I started developing redness and a rash. By day 4 the redness went away.

Update: Day 3 I feel mostly normal but have had intermittent nausea since the evening of day 1. Not sure if it's anxiety related or from the vaccine. It's mild and ginger ale is sufficient. Arm pain is dull now, no worse than a flu shot in terms of pain.",lam09i,2021-03-09 20:12:51

Within the first hour fatigue, drowsiness, and nausea started. At 3 hrs, arm pain began that radiated to scapula and pectoral/axillary area. I took 400 mg naproxen and 626 mg acetominophen. It's worked well, arm isnt in pain. But I'm impossibly sleepy, kinda weak, like the day after a hard workout or a night dancing, and significantly nauseous. I'd compare the nausea to early pregnancy. I'm entertaining taking an anti emetic, but I cant afford to fall asleep so I dont want to take a sedative too.

I am experiencing maybe some psychological side effects. I do want to say I take medications for mental health issues, and I also am super sensitive when I get sick with flu or cold, like out of commission for more days than others. 

I do have a quick question for folks- anyone (ok not anyone just the women lol) have delayed periods due to it? I don't take BC and I'm the kind of person that gets impacted from stress or flu but jw.

Woke up Thursday at 4:30a for work. Felt like someone sucker punched me in the arm. Only tender to the touch but no tenderness when moving arm. 
7a my coworker shows up and I noticed a metallic odor. I questioned my coworker if he could smell it. He wasn‚Äôt sure. We both assumed it was something sprayed by maintenance working in another room. 
1p the metallic odor is now tasted in my donut and my lunch. It‚Äôs much more prominent. Both shoulders were also tender and warm. I felt drained. 
3p I felt even more tired. It was similar to the finale of a flu. No fever. Metallic smell and taste continued. 
5p we picked up dinner and ate. I felt physically better but my tastebuds were slightly off. 
7:30p I worked out with my Oculus. Noticed I was physically exhausted and my left upper arm was sore. I had to quit by 9p due to sudden vertigo and nausea (a first using the oculus). Immediately laid down due to strong nausea. Fell asleep. 
Friday 4:30a arm wasn‚Äôt as sore, no vertigo or nausea, but physically tried. I can smell and taste metal. 
By the afternoon, my lower left diaphragm felt tighter than usual. ‚ÄúElephant on the chest‚Äù feels in and off they the day. 
Saturday: smell and taste slightly metallic but more musty-like. Physically I felt better. Arm wasn‚Äôt tender. Chest still a little tight. No cough. 
Sunday: felt like crap all day. Sluggish physically and mentally. Chest tight and sore in both lower diaphragm. It reminds me of bronchitis minus no cough. I do has asthma but it‚Äôs usually accompanied with a cough when my lungs feel this way. Light headache. Laid down most of the day. Smeller and taste is still off. More of a musty smell than metallic. 
Monday: I felt physically better but both lungs were still tight in lower diaphragm. Felt tired by afternoon. Tastebuds and smeller still not quite right. 
Tuesday: no changes/same situation. Got tested for COVID. 
Wednesday: I feel more drained than the past two days. Lower lungs on fire. Tight chest. Coughed up a small chunk of phlegm at 6a and it didn‚Äôt smell nice. Taste buds and smeller still off. Waiting on my test result. Maybe I do have bronchitis for tis the season for it (spring allergies can trigger it).

"Just got my first dose today March 24th at 8am. (26F) felt nothing for the first 3 hours. The shot itself was so quick and painless. 3 hours in my arm started hurting pretty bad all of a sudden. 6 hours in my arm was hurting worse. Its now been 13 hours and i cant lift my arm higher than half way up. I also feel just generally unwell. 

The unwell feeling is common for me after vaccines though. I got a Tetanus booster two weeks ago and felt the same unwell feeling for two ish days. 

I also feel super hungry then i get really nauseous when i eat. Very tired as well. My eyes are struggling to focus. Going to up my fluid intake and take my daily vitamins. Will update after April 10th after second dose. 

Not looking forward to another round of feeling unwell but ill take it over actual covid symptoms ANY DAY.",lam09i,2021-03-25 05:30:14
"25F here and received my first shot two days ago, like this post said arm punched feeling came after 3 hours. So far the only side effect I‚Äôve had was neck soreness. I did see some people say that they had side effects 5 days post shot so I‚Äôm hoping to avoid that. Other than that I feel fine! Knock on wood. Did do a workout yesterday and actually created too much energy for myself to fall asleep. Trying to keep myself active and not take any medications. You‚Äôre not really suppose to take any medicine so your body can totally fend for yourself and learn to. However if the pain is bad they say Tylenol is ok. Nobody is talking about how medicine shouldn‚Äôt really be taken but I understand with the fever and taking medicine. You guys got this!!!",lam09i,2021-03-25 12:16:03

Immediately after the shot my arm started feeling heavy, like a bag of sand. And there was tenderness. As soon as I got home I was super fatigued and slept for 4 hours. But I still felt fatigued.

6-8 hours later my arm actually started aching near the injection site and it hurt to move it above my head. Plus it made me nervous so I‚Äôll mention it but the muscle which received the injection was twitching on and off for like 2 hours. I didn‚Äôt get a headache.

It‚Äôs the second day for me now and I just woke up, still fatigued. But the lights are a little too bright for my taste. I‚Äôm a bit sensitive to it right now. Arm still aches but no headache. Just a very light sore throat coming on (I think).",lam09i,2021-03-25 18:45:32

 5:30 - symptoms bring on anxiety/panic attack, vomiting and nausea continues. 
 I took some anxiety meds and slept until around 7.  

It‚Äôs 9:30 now, I‚Äôve still go mild nausea but was able to eat a few crackers.  My arm is just a little sore.

I had my first Pfizer Pfizer vaccine 3/9/2021 and felt nothing. 

Over the weekend I thought I was suffering from allergies for 3 days but that basically waned and I had my 2nd Pfizer dose on 3/23. About 36 hours after the shot, the cite of injection was very slightly tender. Last night my throat started to feel soar and at work I lost my voice. Went to the local Urgent  Care because I thought I had strep but tested negative. Tested best I‚Äôve for the rapid Covid test and now waiting for the other Covid test. Yes, somehow I could have Covid or I could have viral strep which will go away in 7-10 days.  Coincidence? Related?   Who knows.

"My experience so far:
50F in mostly good health (aside from some middle aged weight gain in the middle). 

1st dose 3/2: sore arm by end of day. Slight chills for the next 36 hrs but still very functional.

2nd dose 3/23: 
12 hrs in, woke up from very uncomfortable sleep with chills, headache and myalgia. Took tylenol, which took some edge off. 

24 hrs later, fever of up to 102¬∞f, chills chills chills in between, fatigue and myalgia in back. 

36-48 hours later, took ibuprofen this time and fever broke, very sweaty, muscles felt better. Resumed normal activity and exercise.

Day three (72 hrs/today): Chills are back. Fatigue is back, both responsive to ibuprofen however. Holding.

What's interesting is that my husband received the Moderna vaccine (1st dose) on Friday and he is tracking with almost the same symptoms as mine but seems to be about 24-36 hours behind me.  This has been crazy. If we had known we would experience this we would never have taken the vaccine.  We are both extremely healthy and practice Bikram Yoga 3-4 days per week.  I couldn't imagine getting through a yoga class anytime in the near future.  Symptoms are listed here:

  

Day 1: 

Sore arm (very sore), otherwise good. Normal day. No fever

Day 2: 

Sore arm, fatigue, chills??? (mild but present) and normal day. 90 Minute Hot Yoga class, fatigue but otherwise good. No fever

Day 3: 

Sore arm, fatigue, chills (mild), but I did a yoga class and aside from being extremely tired was fine. No fever

Day4: 

Fatigue got worse and had strange muscle pain, not like normal post exercise recovery. It was almost a burning soreness with muscle fatigue. No fever BP 130/72

Day 5: 

Fatigue, severe headache, stuffy nose, chills. Tylenol and Advil do nothing for the headache, can't sleep because of headache, chills and stuffy nose. No fever. Did a hot yoga class and mostly laid on the mat.

Day 6:

Insane crushing headache, Advil and Tylenol are still not doing much, lots of sinus pressure, can't sleep because of head congestion, sinus pressure and headache with chills, coughing ensued, sore glands and a strange tenderness in the back of my throught and roof of my mouth and fatigued. The headache is gripping and tinnitus is bad. No fever BP is 126/80

Day 7: 

The worst. All the symptoms from yesterday but slept most of the day and didn't leave the couch. Took cold medicine for congestion and Tylenol for headache. Slept off an on propped up on pillows. Tinnutis is bad. No fever

Day 8:

Woke up with a headache, less severe than yesterday. Chills and sweats are gone. Congestion seems to be lessening hour by hour. No joint or muscle pain. No fever BP is 127/70 

Advil is helping take the edge off the headache but it is ever present.

Day 9:

Still can‚Äôt sleep. Headache is mostly controlled with Adil and Tylenol. Sinuses are stuffy and fatigue comes and goes. Taste and smell are on and ff. I have a strange floral aroma and taste that stays with me all day. No fever",lam09i,2021-03-27 18:17:31

On Friday, March 26th, a full week after the first dose, I suddenly developed chills and significant body aches. I checked and my fever was 100.7. It went up to 102.0 at its highest and I couldn't sleep because of the body aches. Acetaminophen helped more than ibuprofen, but neither helped a lot that first night.


Saturday, my fever ranged from 99.7 to 100.7 and the body aches decreased. Sunday, the aches went away and 99.7 was my highest temperature. Sunday night and so far today, no fever and no aches.


It lasted 48 hours, with Friday being the worst. I was worried at first because I hadn't heard of anyone experiencing a reaction a full week later, but I can't think of another reason for what happened.",lam09i,2021-03-29 20:02:00

I woke up today feeling restless and tired the whole day. I work from home and towards the end of my shift today I felt dizzy and nauseous.

I have talked to a friend who is a registered nurse here (Kelowna, BC, Canada), who also received the vaccine.
He however received it two weeks prior me so I asked about his experiences. He told me that he felt like I did, general fatigued and exhausted as well as little energy at the gym for about 8 to 10 days after the vaccine. He stated that it is common for some to have these symptoms for a little while after, however he told me that if you have ANY respiratory issues at all to contact your doctor about it.

Still planning on getting the second dose. I interface heavily with the public in both work and my private practice. Zoom has been okay, but it would be really helpful to see some of them in person (once we are both vaccinated and still with masks/hepa filters/air flow, etc).",lam09i,2021-03-11 16:55:44

"I also have asthma and did not have this experience with my first vaccine (received Saturday afternoon, so 4 days ago now.) I did have a slightly elevated blood pressure reading on Tuesday but don't currently have a way to test it again and feel normal today compared to my fatigue yesterday and previous days so I think it's back to normal. I also have anxiety so it could have been elevated just from that stress.",lam09i,2021-03-11 04:54:14

"Disclaimer: I am not an expert nor a medical professional, this is merely from my own perspective opinion.  From what I have read: ""pain or swelling at the injection site were similar in both groups of patients, but whole-body reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, fever and muscle or joint pains were more frequently reported by those who had recovered from Covid-19"". This was related to ALL doses. Ymmv as reactions are different for everyone.",lam09i,2021-03-12 22:46:37
"My husband and I both had very mild cases of Covid in January. I had a scratchy throat and loss of taste and smell for 5 days, no other symptoms.  He had a headache and bloodshot eyes.

We both had our first dose of the vaccine yesterday midday. Both of us woke up this morning feeling fine, had breakfast then simultaneously started to not feel well. We both have had headaches, body aches, and general fatigue all day to the point we have stayed in bed for the entire day. We are feeling worse today than when were actually sick. Hope that it does not continue past today because if it does I will consider not getting the second dose....",lam09i,2021-03-21 02:21:52

"I would say this is a mild allergic reaction and is not uncommon. A mild rash at the injection site or on your arms/legs is a possible side effect.

I have had similar experience. Got my first dose on 2/3. It is now 2/11 and I am still feeling body aches/soreness as well as headaches in the back of my head. I am also noticing that I am clenching my jaw/teeth frequently (maybe due to headaches?). Spoke with my doctor who basically told me to take Tylenol. Doesn‚Äôt sound like there is any resources out there to determine if this is abnormal and something to worry about... everyone else I have talked to who received the vaccine said they were back to 100% after 48 hours.,lam09i,2021-02-11 23:15:08

Now 12 days out and still have them. I feel the same way. I told my husband I just want to sit and cry because it‚Äôs not getting better. I had a CT scan and a hearing test and bloodwork done. Nothing came up. Scheduled for vestibular testing, allergy testing and an MRI.

Finally went to the eye doctor and found out I had damaged my trochlear nerve in my eye from the virus or immune response to it. After some consistent eye exercises it went away. For some though, it never goes away but there are corrective lenses to help alleviate it.",lam09i,2021-03-14 23:56:55

By the next day I started feeling extremely fatigued, all over achey/muscle fatigue and chills. Over the next few days to add to this I started feeling waves of nausea, dizzy spells and mad itches on arms. 
I'm now on day 8 and still experiencing all of the side effects.
Tried to go into work today and was sent home within the hour, currently awaiting call back from GP as I'm also concerned now at how long this is lasting with no relief or sign of improvement.
Hope you feel better soon!",lam09i,2021-03-03 14:20:42

Soreness was gone by Friday. I got a tiny bit sleepy Friday afternoon and just a little bit of an upset stomach but nothing major at all. I‚Äôm scheduled to get the second dose Friday the 26th in the morning. I was able to make a Friday appt for the second shot because my primary physician warned me that most likely I‚Äôll have some side effects from the second one. If that happens I‚Äôll have the weekend to rest. Will report back after I get the second one.,lam09i,2021-02-20 02:24:08

I talked to my doctor today and told him about it and he did say that it's unusual for the onset of the reactions to start days after, but just told me that it's just because how my immune system works, he said it was a really good thing because it showed that the vaccine was working.
He also absolutely insisted to get the 2nd shot, and I was like 'everyone says the 2nd is the worst, I can't go through that hell again' and he assured me that I probably wouldn't have a reaction at all the second time, because my immune system built up a ton of antibodies during the month I was in hell.

So I'm going to schedule the 2nd for this week and pray that he's right.

I'll report in if anything starts to get familiar.",lam09i,2021-03-25 04:23:06

"Honestly, it is understandable. Realistically over 100 millions doses of the vaccine have been given here in the US and over 40 million are fully vaccinated. The majority of people who take the vaccine are fine. You might have a sore arm and if you are stressed you might have some muscle ache or tightness in your neck or shoulders which will most likely be caused by your anxiety. So just stay calm and remember the vaccine is meant to help us and it will help you. So don‚Äôt stress about it, you are doing the right thing. My friends who have had covid and are vaccinated said they would rather do the vaccine again than have covid again. Even those who didn‚Äôt have terrible cases.

Only know my grandma that‚Äôs gotten dose 2 (moderna) and she had a slight fever for one day, as well as more soreness and swelling. 

I‚Äôm expecting to feel worse after dose 2, probably going to burn a vacation day for the day after just because I have the time to use. Will use it to get caught up around the house if I feel well enough.",lam09i,2021-03-08 20:02:11

"It's been 3 days, Day 2 saw the end of my sore arm (ibuprofen really helped at the end of day 1 because it hurt pretty good.) I was mildly fatigued until today. Not bad over all, also had a slightly elevated BP yesterday but could have been my horrible anxiety. Feeling normal today, even did spring cleaning in my garage. Hopefully shot 2 won't be too much worse though I'm expecting the same arm soreness and fatigue at the least.",lam09i,2021-03-11 04:48:51

The symptoms were worse than I expected to be honest.

I woke up the next day feeling terrible and crappy, I had a high fever of 39c,( 102f ), extreme headache that I have never experienced before, and sore arms. I was knocked out the entire day.

But it only lasted for about 24 hours. The next day I was fine, just my arm remained sore for about 5 days and that was it.

I would definitely do it again with a heart beat if had to.",lam09i,2021-04-02 20:21:56

Well I know four people who died from covid and one long hauler, and no one who has died from the vaccine. But also, I do trust that the data being reported on adverse effects are correct, which I gather you don't.  If you don't believe the data we get from the medical establishment, then how exactly the fuck do we know about all the opoid deaths?  According to your logic, those should all just be covered up, too. If we can trust the medical establishment to report on adverse events from opiods, then we can trust them to report on adverse events from vaccines.

"If only it were that easy, every single person on the planet reacts differently to anything you put in your body, of course there are many people who have migraines, but you can't and shouldn't assume to know or discredit someone else's experiences with the same health issue(s) you have and what treatments help or not.

I'm sorry Tylenol doesn't help you, I wish everyone could snuff out migraines with a couple cheap OTC pills, but it just doesn't work that way. I consider myself very fortunate that it's highly effective for me. 
I AM clinically diagnosed FYI, and what I feel from them is terrible, but to you, you might feel that yours are much worse (or mine are nonexistent) because from your own personal experience trying Tylenol; it did nothing.


I'm not saying one's migraine is worse than the other, but short of being able to jump into someone else's body there is not one person in the world who can truly experience exactly how someone else really feels.

"Contergean aka thalidomide was developed in 1956 and heavily marketed by the German pharmaceutical company that developed it. [Please see Chemie Gr√ºehthal]. BioNtech is working in conjunction with Pfizer to produce several covid vaccines. Just because a drug isn‚Äôt produced by an American company doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be made available to Americans under different names. (You ever heard of generic drugs?!) 

20,000 Americans, including pregnant women, were given thalidomide in ‚Äúchemical trials‚Äù in the early 1960‚Äôs causing thousands of deaths and miscarriages along with babies born with malformed limbs. The pharmaceutical company that did this trial with thalidomide was an American company called Richardson-Merrill and Smith, Kline.  Sound familiar?  The side effects were not obvious immediately just as those aren‚Äôt for all these experimental covid vaccines.  When you volunteer to be in a clinical trial for a drug that is not proven safe or effective, you have no legal rights. 

Please be sure to read the fine print before you get a vaccine that has been FDA EUA for use only NOT for FDA APPROVAL and even FDA approval is suspect after President Obama signed legislation that pushes pharmaceutical drugs to market with less research requirements.

Walgreens currently only lets you do 21-22. I plan to change the date of my first one on their form to a day after my first dose so I can schedule me second one for a Friday so I don‚Äôt miss work if I feel like shit after.

CDC as of 2/10/21

‚ÄúPersons should not be scheduled to receive the second dose earlier than recommended (i.e., 3 weeks [Pfizer-BioNTech] or 1 month [Moderna]). However, second doses administered within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid. Doses inadvertently administered earlier than the grace period should not be repeated.

The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval and a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond this window. If the second dose is administered beyond these intervals, there is no need to restart the series.‚Äù

More likely an annual dose, like flu, but only if administered properly in the first place (not happening here yet)

Regarding 1/2 vaccinating more people. Some of the population are more vulnerable than others. Some are exposed to more risk.

"An anecdotal story for you- 

I was convinced I had dizziness and headaches every day for 21 days after my first shot.  (You can see it in my comment history).  After mentioning it to my friend, she sent me a couple screenshots of me complaining of the same thing in January when I became postpartum.   (I received my shot at the end of March).  I wasn‚Äôt planning to get my second because I was CONvINcEd it was all related.  My dr told me she thought I was dehydrated and did a CBC.  My red blood count and cholesterol was higher than usual (usually I‚Äôm perfectly within the optimal ranges.  But these results can be explained by dehydration).  I didn‚Äôt believe it was a hydration issue and kept feeling super anxious about it.  I forced her to redo my bloodwork a few days later and drank a ton of water mainly thinking I would shove it in her face when everything was still askew.  Well, everything was back to normal...

I wasn‚Äôt planning to get my second shot but then became a bit more anxious about being in limbo..I was especially anxious after reading all these Reddit posts... but then thought that I know about 60+ people in real life  who have been vaccinated since December with no consequence.  (Not to say there aren‚Äôt people with issues.  I‚Äôm just letting you know that it‚Äôs not always the case)

so I drank a lot of water and got my second shot... felt only arm soreness and a little fatigue that didn‚Äôt stop me from working remotely while taking care of two kids Under 3.... 

I guess my point it, maybe the ringing in your ears could be from clenching your jaw from feeling understandably anxious about getting the vaccine?? Anxiety is a bitch... I‚Äôve suffered from it in many forms and it actually gave me TMJ after my first child. TMJ + anxiety has really been hard for me the last 3 years!! 

Not saying this is the case, but try calming down and drinking a ton of water and if you start to feel a little better - awesome! If you don‚Äôt then keep working to find out the cause! Good luck!",l96w0h,2021-04-28 16:44:36

"Awesome to see comments like this! Sucks that you had to deal with this, but I'm glad your friend was there for you and you figured it out in the end!
I have severe health anxiety. I had a full blown panic attack when I got my 1st shot (2nd shot is in 2 more weeks). But, after 14 years of therapy I am finally able to recognize when I'm panicking. I was worried about getting dizzy, and lo and behold,I was dizzy and lightheaded BEFORE getting the shot! So I got the shot, waited 30 mins, drank a ton of water and ate a Granola bar. The panic attack calmed down about 10-20 mins after the shot and all was well. My anxiety has been heightened this week, but I blame that on finals and lack of sleep. 
I have a whole post on my experience to help out others who are nervous prior to their shot. It's nice to hear others reassuring fellow anxiety sufferers that yes, the anxiety is valid but it's JUST anxiety and ""it too will pass"".",l96w0h,2021-05-10 04:39:00
"Thanks for taking time to respond. I saw my doctor yesterday and while he‚Äôs not convinced it was the Pfizer shot that caused the onset, he is doing research on the issue. He told me to take some B-12 and see if that helps. He checked ears and said nothing regarding inflammation.

During this time, VAERS received 934 reports of death* (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records findings revealed no link with vaccination. CDC and FDA will continue to investigate reports of adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS.

"No. I‚Äôm not trying to start a war with people but not one of the vaccines are FDA approved for safety or efficacy. They got EUA which means the pharmaceutical companies can distribute the vaccines but they are not liable for the safety or efficacy of the vaccines. The media is guilty of interchanging the term APPROVED when authorization should be used. 

The government approved EUA of the vaccines but not FDA approved. It‚Äôs very different! They are approved for distribution not for being safe or effective against covid. The pharmaceutical companies have zero liability and are making a fortune off vaccines that normally are studied for about 10 years before getting FDA approval thus, the term EUA; EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION. 

If people want to get injected with an experimental vaccine because the benefits outweigh their risks, so be it but it is a personal decision to get ANY pharmaceutical drugs and is a decision to be made with their physician and it‚Äôs a personal decision. People have died from the vaccines. If you want to get one, it should be a choice. Why are we at war about this?  I definitely don‚Äôt want covid but almost everyone I know has had it. I‚Äôd rather get covid than the vaccine.  I have medical issues that preclude me from the risks of getting an experimental drug. That‚Äôs MY business.

"25/F I received my first shot on Monday evening 4/5 with no noticeable side effects (besides my usual seasonal allergies), however almost a week later on Sunday 4/11 I started a fever of 99.7. I still have a fever and generally just feel pretty crappy. It sounds like these side effects aren‚Äôt uncommon, but everything I‚Äôve seen says they usually start in the first 1-2 days and then resolve. I‚Äôm glad to hear I‚Äôm not alone :)

I have pretty bad seasonal allergies that have been ramping up the last 3 weeks (I‚Äôm in Minnesota). Symptoms include itchy eyes, post nasal drip/ sore throat, increased severity of oral allergy syndrome with trigger foods, and occasionally hives. These have been pretty bad this week, but I didn‚Äôt initially think that these could‚Äôve been related to the covid vaccine, however, I‚Äôm wondering if my immune system is just overwhelmed right now with allergies and trying to build antibodies.

I also a took a covid test this morning as a precaution.",l8skoz,2021-04-12 18:36:04

Both of my parents got Moderna.  1st shot, Dad was fatigued with arm pain for a few days.  Second shot, Mom had chills in bed, joint pain etc.  Dad had worse arm pain and fatigue.  Miserable.  I can‚Äôt help but think the companies reporting that in their trials 2 and 3 percent got fatigue is a falsehood.  Everyone I know that has had either shot had fatigue and other symptoms.  Not to say it‚Äôs bad, just unbelievable at the claimed 2 and 3 percent rate.",l8skoz,2021-04-22 21:21:26
"You know what all of the people arguing that these vaccines are safe and tested and blah blah blah DON'T know because they haven't RESEARCHED anything ANYTHING about the previous mRNA vaccines developed for Sars/CoV and Mers back in 2010/ 2011. If they did they would see that ALL of those vaccine candidates FAILED due to a host of horrific side effects that only showed up AFTER they were introduced to the virus as a means of testing the effectiveness of the vaccine. Those that made it that far were the lucky ones as the vaccine killed ALL the ferrets. Now, here's the real kicker....there have been NO CHANGES to the mRNA vaccines being pushed on us, none. So before you call anyone a conspiracy theorist or whatever for not taking the vaccine do research on vaccines made for Corona viruses like the common cold or the original Sars/Mers viruses.. The info is out there for you to find and read for yourselves and it's not from some made up news media outlet, it's from journal articles by the NIH and others detailing the production, use and outcome of said vaccines.

"Correct the vaccines are not FDA approved but if you did get covid and you did get sick would you take the FDA approved remdesivir? I wouldn't want to take it.  Just look it up, but just saying FDA approval means nothing.   There are are ton of FDA approved drugs on the market and they can cause serious side effects.   The vaccines have also been tested for safety and efficiency during the trials consisted of more than 43k participants.   Also, any serious side effects would have been detected by now as well.  You can search to see what I'm talking about as I'm sure you're able to navigate google.  There are alot of people who are against any vaccine and I know you believe or can say for certain that the vaccine is bad for people and you're probably just wanting to warn complete strangers out of the kindness of your heart.  It's a risk decision for anyone wanting to roll the dice on the vaccine or on getting covid.  Nobody, and I mean nobody knows what long term effects the vaccine will have, could be we all get long term effects,  could be it helps prevent cancer and adds years to our lives. You stated that most get over the virus, which statistically is true.  The mortality rate is 2% in the US and 3% for the world, so yes most get over it in that aspect.   We're also not talking about the people who had to be hospitalized and put on ventilators that lived.  We're also not talking about the people who has permanent damage from having covid either, so despite all of that, then yes most people survive.",l8skoz,2021-03-23 18:03:39

"So the arm tingling stopped, but that same night  I posted that comment 6 days ago I had a searing pain from my clavicle up my neck and into my face. Then my cheek went numb. Felt like when you go to the dentist and they numb you for a procedure. I went to the ER (now my second trip) and they checked for stroke (I didn‚Äôt have one). They wanted to admit me for observation to be seen by a neurologist and further testing but after being there for 8 hours alone in a room I got really anxious and asked for a referral to outpatient. If I would have known that it would be 2 months before I could get in to see a neurologist outpatient I would have stayed there!

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at on day 8: the facial numbness faded. I have brain fog and a dull ache that travels around. Yesterday it was in my left shoulder blade, today it‚Äôs in my left clavicle (where the searing pain was). I also have random stabbing pains throughout my body. It feels like someone is poking me really hard and then it goes away after about 5 seconds. Happens all over and almost never in the same place twice.

I hope it all goes away soon. I was able to make an appointment with an Internist for Thursday to start figuring out these random pains. I decided I will not be opting in to the second shot, or at least until someone can figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt much information out there about adverse effects and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable being further subjected to experimentation.",l8skoz,2021-04-20 03:26:34

"A couple of different sub-reddits and also several random news articles from different sources, which to my knowledge have all been trusted news sources. I haven't gone searching for information specifically on it since I got both of my vaccines, but whenever I see a news story posted about the vaccine (which is pretty frequent these days) or someone post on Reddit about their experience, I read up on it because I find it interesting. Of course at this point it's all anecdotal and everyone handles things differently, but it sounds like the odds are probably in your favor.",l8skoz,2021-03-22 20:15:28

Fever persisted for 8 hours. Woke up with a head ache. Its been 26 hours and i feel fine with a bit of a headache still.

I‚Äôve been stretching my arm like crazy and drinking water hoping that I can stay on top of whatever comes and avoid the sore stiff feeling.

So far just a very sore arm and a bit of fatigue. Thanks for sharing your experiences, everyone! Knowing what to expect took the edge of my anxiety.

Update: Felt fine until about 13 hours post vaccine. Currently under a pile of blankets with severe muscle aches, chills, headache, and a low grade fever. I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it, the aches have me on the verge of tears. Took Tylenol and hoping that l can get some sleep. I do have a very reactive immune system. My partner also got his second dose and he is fine apart from a very sore arm. I‚Äôll update in the morning!

Day 2 Update: fever finally broke at 4am. Felt bad all day but thankfully fever and chills are gone. Headache, brain fog, and muscle soreness. I have a very reactive immune system in general, so I‚Äôm not all that surprised, but my symptoms were more severe than I expected! It‚Äôs 8pm now and I‚Äôm exhausted and achey.

"31YO female, very good health, rarely sick, fit and good diet, never have had COVID.

24/03/2021: First dose
Sore arm for 24 hours. Nothing else

14/03/2021: Second Dose
Nothing except dead arm around 4 hours post vaccine. Diarrhea around 6 hours post vaccine. Took Imodium and 2 paracetamol and slept through the night.

Woke up 16 hours post vaccine. Achey body and muscles, like really bad post gym DOMS. Took paracetamol again. Went to work and powered through. Felt fatigued and foggy in my head. 20 hours post vaccine, aches got worse. Went to nurse in my school to get more paracetamol. She took my temperature and it was 38.4 (around 102/3 I think!) Took more paracetamol and went home. Currently 24hours post vaccine and in bed with hot water bottle. Only managed to eat a slice of toast all day. 

I am rarely sick so this is a weird one for me. Honestly don't think I've ever had a fever. Gonna try and sleep for a while and hopefully begin to feel better! Wasn't expecting any side effects so I'm surprised but hoping my body is busy creating a good immune response! Good luck to anyone who is due their next shot.",l8e8kj,2021-04-15 12:43:50

me decide I am not getting the 2nd Pfizer dose.

I‚Äôm sorry but these side effects are NOT normal for a vaccine, and I get the flu shot every year. I appreciate the sacrifice everyone has made in getting the 2nd dose but after what I went through with the first one there is no way I am putting my body at potential risk for who knows what.",l8e8kj,2021-04-16 12:56:48

I had the vaccine yesterday morning, and all day yesterday I had almost no side effects other than slight soreness. Very late last night I started getting a headache followed by chills. Made it difficult to sleep. The fever is relatively low (100) but still enough to put me out of commission. Not expecting this to last longer than today.

Forgot to add also, muscle pain. It feels like a mild flu.",l8e8kj,2021-04-27 18:52:34

First 15 mins: immediate arm soreness at injection site

13 hours: woke up with chills, teeth chattering and couldn‚Äôt get warm.  Muscle aches and joint aches too, my literal skin hurt, even my eyeballs burned.  Felt like I had the flu for sure.  I took Tylenol, drifted back to sleep

17 hours: woke again with same symptoms, joint aches too and still chilling, popped some more a Tylenol, lots of urination too. Weird dreams 

22 hours: woke for the day, still felt off.  Took day off and tried to hydrate

24 hours: started to feel cold again so took Tylenol and laid down for nap

27 hours: still feel off with nausea too. 

28 hours pop another Tylenol and drink some Gatorade and finally start to feel better.  

Got a good night sleep and woke up feeling better.  Still feel tired and clammy like I‚Äôm getting over a cold but would do it all again to not get covid

Its about 5hrs in and I don't really feel much, a lil soreness in my arm, and I THINK im starting to get some achyness, but then again my body might just be broken lol.

I plan on putting myself in an edibles coma so I sleep heavy through the night. 

Will report how that goes.

930pm: took 2000mg full spectrum oil tincture

10:30 injection sight soreness is noticeable, but not bad or incapacitating. I had tried moving my arms above my head and massaged my muscle as I read recommendations online.

1132pm: im going to bed, still feel alright.  Let's hope this works lol

Update:

10am: was able to wake up and get out of bed, my body was really achy, felt like a hangover (I did have a few celebratory drinks of whiskey), was fatigued, but other than that i felt fine.

Took it pretty easy during the day, by the evening I wasn't nearly as sore. 

9pm: Took another 1000mg sip of tincture
10pm: went to bed

1pm (48hrs in): I feel pretty good, not 100% more like 95%.

About 6-8 hours later I had a headache start to creep on. 

About 10-11 hours later my eyes started to hurt a little, similar to the way they do in a severe headache or migraine. I felt like I warmed up about a degree or two and I had literally about 2-3 brief ‚Äúbone aches‚Äù that all led me to believe I was about to get slammed. 

I always drink wine before bed to help fall asleep but I swear the vaccine had me like, amped up and wired a bit. I ended up staying up until about 3-4 am and nothing ever happened. 

It‚Äôs now 10 am the next day. I slept relatively hard, and I felt a little extra sleepy this morning with a slightly sore arm. That‚Äôs it.

I am a 53 yo F VERY healthy, don't take any prescription meds. Very RARELY sick and never miss work due to illness.

Shot 1: March 13- absolutely nothing but a sore arm. 

Shot 2: April 4 at 11:00 am.  Didn't feel anything this day (did have trouble sleeping that night). Went to work the next day and started to have chills around 4:00 (so almost 30 hours after shot). Got home and had 100.6 fever and chills. My unusual side effect was that I had gastro issues- I had such bad gas (I know this sounds funny, but it was AWFUL). By the next day it turned into diarrhea. The diarrhea was never severe-I was able to make it to work, kept drinking lots of extra fluids. It took a few more days and then I experienced soreness in my hips and back of thighs along with some joint pain.  It all seemed to be a delayed reaction to me.  My gastro issues continued on for almost 2 weeks, slowly getting better. I'm now 18 days out and my bowels are finally ALMOST back to normal.   It has caused me SO MUCH anxiety because none of it seemed to fit into the ""typical"" side effects, and it lingered for a long time.  I did learn that of all 3 vaccines, pfizer is the only one that has diarrhea as a side effect.

After sleeping for about 7 hours, I awoke to a dull headache, pressure behind the eyes, overall muscle aches, tight lower back and a strained sternomastoid. 400mg of ibuprofen allowed me to drift in and out of sleep. 

24 hours post vaccine, I started to feel a bit better but my muscle pain spread into my joints. Continued hydrating and ate a decent dinner and began to see a stabilization on pain.

36-48 hours later, took ibuprofen this time and fever broke, very sweaty, muscles felt better. Resumed normal activity and exercise.

"Got my 2nd dose yesterday. Experienced diarrhea about 8 hours later. Wokeup the next morning feeling like I‚Äôve been hit by a bus! I‚Äôm now 24 hours out. Feeling achy, shortness of breathe, loss of appetite, and lethargic. I just forced myself to eat a plain bagel. Any idea how long this might last? I feel like I basically have covid all over again üò´",l8e8kj,2021-04-06 18:16:15
Some people have worse reactions to the second dose mostly because you‚Äôre body is realizing that it needs to mass produce anti body‚Äôs to keep you safe.,l8e8kj,2021-04-07 18:09:57
9 hours post vaccine knocked me. My entire body and teeth were rapidly shaking and chattering. I‚Äôm 12 hours post shot now and I‚Äôm in a calm period rn other than arm pain. But I did put on a sweater and put a heating pad on my back amongst other warming things like soup and hot water for sipping. Not sure about my fever. It was 98.9 immediately pre intense shivering.,l8e8kj,2021-04-11 03:06:03
"I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get hit so hard by this! 30, female. I got my second dose at 4:30pm yesterday. Felt fine, arm was a little sore. Went to bed but couldn‚Äôt sleep, just tossed and turned. About 12 hours into it at 4:45am I got bad body aches and headache. Also some nausea. Been dealing with the body aches and headache all day. Chills and feverish on and off, highest my temp has read is 99.5, I‚Äôm usually in the 97 range. Haven‚Äôt taken anything yet but if it doesn‚Äôt get better by this evening I‚Äôll take some Tylenol so I can get some sleep. Grateful it‚Äôs Sunday as I haven‚Äôt left the bed!

For reference, I felt completely fine after the first shot. Maybe slightly flushed but hardly even had arm pain.

Edit: just took my temp again, almost 24 hours in. New high is 100.7 hoping it doesn‚Äôt climb any higher

Edit: took some Tylenol 28 hours in. Finally felt some relief and was able to sleep through the night. Feel way better this morning. Very exhausted still though like I could definitely spend all day sleeping and slight headache. Winded if I do too much (like walk upstairs).",l8e8kj,2021-04-11 23:20:21

"Healthy F/30 

1st dose: pain at injection site for 24 hours.

2nd dose: Received second Pfizer shot today at 10:30am. Muscle at injection site jumped away from arm pretty intensely. No issues other than mild pain at injection site. Worked desk job rest of day and drank lots of water. Climbed into bed at 10pm with major sore arm at injection site and started shivering, cold hands and feet around 10:30pm. 11:30pm finally gained the courage to leave my bed to throw on a winter robe and wool socks.

2nd one... Wowzers. Received it at 430 4/11. Pretty much ok until about 5a the next day, woke up with severe chills. Back to sleep and up at ten AM. 102 degree fever, headache, body and muscle aches and oh the nausea and vomiting üò≥ fought that all day. Went to sleep because the exhaustion is just crazy and slept for twelve hours. 2 hour Nap required after being awake an hour, and whoa did I have some crazy dreams üò≥ drenched in sweat and my fever had lowered. Awake for a half hour, another nap, more dreams and my temperature is normal. But I Definitely think I could just go back to sleep and stay that way for the whole night.

"Hi! 30F, fit and active, great immune system. Just wanted to share my experience here -

Pfizer 1st Dose: 3/18, sore arm. A little foggy, nothing bad until 3 weeks later when my menstrual cycle was delayed by a week (I‚Äôm never late), and that week brought on some hellacious PMS symptoms. When it did come, my cramps were worse than they‚Äôve been in years. 

Pfizer 2nd Dose: 4/16. About 6 hours in, I got a little foggy and my arm got pretty sore. I drank two beers with fully vaccinated friends, took some ibuprofen, then went to sleep for the night. Woke up around 3 AM with some night sweats, but nothing too terrible. When I woke up for the day, my head was very foggy, mild headache, and feeling tired, and my arm felt like lead ‚Äî but no body aches, didn‚Äôt feel feverish or warm. Just took ibuprofen throughout the day and felt fine, just sluggish, and then some lethargy and fatigue hit around 4 PM. Went away after a few hours, took an AdvilPM and slept really well. So, nothing too terrible. I‚Äôm 48 hours in and still feel a little sluggish today, but I‚Äôve been able to do my tasks and go to the grocery and otherwise feel completely fine! Not looking forward to the possible menstrual cycle changes again, though...",l8e8kj,2021-04-18 21:25:33
"Im 55 y/o female with underlying health conditions that already cause achy joints & fatigue, so it‚Äôs hard to say how the vaccine affected those symptoms. I had my 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on Saturday afternoon & I felt fine until I was called up to receive my card & leave. I felt a bit woozy so they had me drink water. I felt better after another 15 minutes & left. I felt a weird (almost like out of my body) on the way to my car, so I rested in my car for a little while before driving. I also had a mild headache.
Sunday afternoon I had chills, temp of 99 (I have a lower body temp generally, so at 99 F I feel like crap).
Later I felt just overall weird...some parts of body cold & some hot. Hard to get comfortable. Very touchy emotionally all day. Now Monday morning, more sobbing & touchy emotionally. 
It is definitely going to need to be a self care day.",l8e8kj,2021-04-19 13:02:40

I was in bed for two days and ended up flushing out my system with magnesium citrate. Well, last night for mother‚Äôs day I ate a steak and right away I was miserable. The beef just doesn‚Äôt seem to be digesting. I have eaten beef all my life and never had this problem before the vaccine.

"69 YO male, got second dose on March 29 in Murietta, CA. Got the expected soreness and 101 degree fever / vomiting a few days out, then better or so I thought. The fever came back, approximately weekly, for six weeks, though weaker each time. More ominously my bio markers worsened. As I am monitoring health closely due to prostate cancer.  My kidneys went from healthy to stage 3 failure (eGFR from 90 to 35). Blood pressure increase by 20 mm of HG. CRP from 1.5 to 2.8. I was having a measurable inflammation event, kidney failure, and hypertension in addition to the recurring fever. My sedimentation rate of 33 indicates a blood clotting risk.  Not fun, since my PSA (prostate cancer risk) doubled in two months where it had been taking 12, probably as a result of the inflammation attack. The vaccination is not worth it.",l8e8kj,2021-05-18 17:52:06

"Received second dose at 10:15AM on Friday, 5/21. Injection slightly more painful than first dose - healthcare worker said they had new needles...

Started feeling lethargic at work and by the end of the work-day it was difficult to focus and I could feel a heavy sensation behind my eyes.

On the drive home, around 6:30PM, I felt lethargic, but not nauseous like with the first dose while driving home.

At approximately 9:30PM, I started feeling hot and cold (fever, I‚Äôm sure but I never measured my temperature) and my hands tingled because they were ice-cold. I went to bed about an hour later with my fianc√©. I then started shivering uncontrollably for about three minutes until my body started to warm up from being wrapped up in my comforter and fleece blanket. I was feeling like dog-sh!t at this point - aches and pains, the arm where I received the injection, ouch!!! I could feel it going up the left side of my neck. My fianc√© got me some ibuprofen and after about an hour, I was feeling slightly better and was able to go to sleep.

At 12:57AM, early this morning, I woke up and was very uncomfortable, feverish, limbs ice cold but my chest, legs, face were red-hot. I could not go back to sleep - I ended up going to the kitchen and eating some starburst which was a nice little treat for my dry, hot mouth. Downed some water and fell back asleep around 3AM.

I woke up this morning (5/22) around 10:00AM (approx 24hrs since inoculation) and I was feeling pretty normal. My arm was sore which was to be expected and I felt like I was running on about 70% battery-life.

A few hours later, I started feeling feverish again, achy, and that heavy, burning sensation behind my eyes. I could never get comfortable enough to actually nap. Felt pretty lethargic and on about 40% battery-life.

Food also tasted different throughout the day, odd that I had an appetite at all...anyway, I started feeling better about 8:30PM today, I had a surge of hunger hit me and I satisfied it and now I‚Äôm writing this.

Tips: ice-pack on injection site at night is glorious. Take some Tylenol or ibuprofen and stay hydrated and fed. Don‚Äôt move around a lot however keep using the arm you got the shot in.

EDIT: Added date I received second dose",l8e8kj,2021-05-23 05:36:15

"My reaction to the second dose has been awful. I swear I can't remember the last time I felt this fucking sick. I felt fine until about 12 hours after the shot. Then I had a fever, chills, nausea, abdominal pain and the worst body aches and joint pain I've ever experienced. It's been over 24 hours and I still feel awful.

"Some people have only had mild effects (or even none) so it‚Äôs hard to say for sure what you may experience. Of the people I know personally who have had a stronger reaction like I did, it was only for one day. I started feeling the chills and aches approx 10ish hours  after the vaccine and then immediately slept all night before my full day of feeling bad. I would say definitely REST, regardless of how you are feeling, as much as possible for the next 24-48 hours so your body can do what it needs to do. Don‚Äôt stay up late, don‚Äôt eat junk, keep hydrated, and just rest/sleep any time you don‚Äôt have to be at work. I hope you are one of the lucky ones who doesn‚Äôt have it too bad. Also, some people have been worried about taking pain relievers for their symptoms for fear of it causing the vaccine to not work as well. But it is ok to take a little something if you feel really awful AFTER a vaccine. So don‚Äôt hesitate if you do feel bad.",l8e8kj,2021-02-10 05:04:16

What fatal side effects? Are you concerned about potential anaphylaxis? That would typically happen very quickly after the shot which is why they have people stay at the vaccine site for monitoring for 15+ minutes immediately after.,l8e8kj,2021-03-17 03:32:27
You will be fine :) take a tylenol an hour before you go. They have you wait in a controlled area for 15 min after your shot just in case you have a reaction and there's a bunch of nurses for that. I'm getting my second shot today!,l8e8kj,2021-05-04 17:52:52

"This is not a normal virus. After the first dose I had extra energy, (1 day after the second dose I have mild fever and mild bodyache) I found out most likely the S protein elevated my blood pressure to normal range via binding ACE2 receptors. I always had low blood pressure, I was constantly had less energy because of that, and the first shot impoved a lot. Pfizer has no unnatural ingredients (except PEG, occurring also in your toothpaste), side effects are mostly the side effects of spike protein I guess. In my opinion it's better to get the shot than the real replicating little monster.",l8e8kj,2021-05-27 13:09:51

"Sorry you are having lingering side effects. That has to be frustrating not having full ROM especially considering the job you do. 

Here is the CDC link (if you are in the US) you should have been provided for tracking side effects. I assume you can still register though not sure how the reporting will differ since it‚Äôs been a bit since you got the vaccine. I originally was prompted to report daily, then weekly, and now I get a prompt ever couple of weeks. I think CDC is trying to document any and all types of side effects both long and short term so I‚Äôm sure your experience would be important. I think they also contact people under certain circumstances if there are unusual of lasting effects.

I received #2 on Friday 4/9 and had the worst flu like symptoms occur between 3-12 hours after getting the shot. It went away after about 36-48 hours. Then Wednesday, 4/14, I began feeling like a sore throat coming on and extreme exhaustion with the feeling of an oncoming headache. It is now Friday and the exhaustion and sore throat feeling is still lingering and I can not shake it. Like anytime I do something my body feels completely depleted of all energy.

How long ago did you get your shot?,l8e8kj,2021-03-28 00:43:34

"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really anything you can do to prevent symptoms. But if you do end up having a strong immune reaction (which is a good thing btw), don‚Äôt hesitate to take something to help the headache/body aches. I just took a couple of Advil. How old are the kids? I can definitely sympathize with this situation, I have a 4 yr old. I‚Äôll just say that the day I was knocked on my butt he enjoyed a LOT of extra tv time and easy to make but not the typically ideal meals. Think cereal for breakfast, peanut butter sandwich for lunch and a hodgepodge of fruits, crackers, and yogurt for dinner.

"I think the majority of people hit by the vaccine bus have been all better 36-48 hours later. Just try to hydrate really well and sleep as much as possible. If you‚Äôre having headache or body aches, it‚Äôs ok to take something at this point after the vaccine to help relieve it a bit.

"I'm with you on this. Got my second dose Wednesday and I didn't feel 100% again until this morning. I've had some awful bugs, survived multiple infections due to hospital negligence after a C section, but these side effects were one if the worst experiences for me! I had everything you're describing but also, my legs felt like they'd been beaten with a baseball bat, or like my bones were infected, for lack of a better way to describe it. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen would barely touch it. And strangely, my skin hurt to be touched, the way it does a day after sun burns. I had to send my toddler to my parents' house for the day. But I was told this kind of severe reaction means our immune systems are good and that the vaccine will be very effective for us. Also heard that however you feel after the shot is a sample of how the virus would've made you feel, so I'd choose the vaccine any day.

"I hear you, and normally would agree but the sad truth is that we have no idea what the long term effects of any of these vaccines are, as they are too new for there to be any concrete data. I think it‚Äôs great that they are out there and people are taking them to help grow the herd immunity but at the end of the day it‚Äôs my body and my choice what goes into it. I know people who have had far more severe side effects from the second dose than the effects of actually having COVID, which certainly gives me pause. Getting COVID is certainly still a risk but having one dose significantly reduces that risk and to add another 10% of protection compared to the 66% percent certainly of negative side effects from the 2nd dose really doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. For what it‚Äôs worth many Doctors are even advising patients that they can skip the 2nd dose if they feel at risk. Heck there are studies showing many health professionals are refusing the vaccine altogether. I can always get another dose down the road, but I can‚Äôt undo an injection.",l8e8kj,2021-04-16 20:56:19

I had Pfizer too. The second shot basically gives you flu symptoms for like 12-24 hours. The symptoms don‚Äôt start right away... takes about 12 hours to feel them. Then you‚Äôll feel crappy for 12-24 hours. Fine the next day.,l8e8kj,2021-03-25 16:49:08

"It‚Äôs likely due to the fact that mRNA vaccines are more potent than traditional vector-based vaccines. This explains their effectivity too. We‚Äôre asking our cells to make a single viral protein and then presenting A LOT of ONLY that protein for our immune cells to see. This makes them go crazy in the response (a good thing) and thus makes us feel like crap. Now to compare that with a traditional vaccine. In the vector-based vaccines, there‚Äôs usually more than just viral protein that your immune cells will see (dilutes the immune response, not necessarily a bad thing but is less potent) and the AMOUNT of viral protein is less than that of an mRNA vaccine. This is because our cells use the mRNA to make the protein, which can happen more than once before cells destroy it (analogy: you can refill a plastic water bottle more than once, but eventually you‚Äôll probably throw it away). So the ‚Äúwhy do we feel like crap‚Äù question is most likely because of this - it‚Äôs just more potent... which makes it an efficacious vaccine.",l8e8kj,2021-04-17 01:43:24

"No no no no no. Take a deep breath. So for the Pfizer vaccine there were over 43,000 people in the trials. A total of 6 people died over the course of several months during the trials. None of which had anything to do with the vaccine itself. 4 of them didn‚Äôt even receive the vaccine, they got the saline placebo. Of the 2 that were part of the trial and received the vaccine, one died of a heart attack over 2 months after getting the 2nd dose. And the other, who died 3 days after the first dose I believe, had (can‚Äôt remember the exact name of the condition) something that is essentially hardening of the arteries, like plaque buildup and such which happens over a long period of time usually from bad diet, smoking, genetics etc. All 6 were just in a very very large trial group and death for one reason or another just happens when you are considering such a large cross section of people of varying ages and health history. Please try not to stress about it. Do something nice for yourself to take your mind off of it. And when you do get your second vaccine, keep in mind that if you do experience any side effects (mostly feeling like you‚Äôve got the dang flu for 24 hours in most cases) have been fairly common. Just get rest and let your body do what it‚Äôs supposed to do and take comfort in knowing you‚Äôve done your part to help stop this awful virus AND protect yourself and your loved ones.

They will tell you that flu disappeared because people stayed home and and wore masks. Think. If that were the case, Covid would have disappeared. I heard a physician say that Covid is just another flu. How many people die annually? If you check the stats, that number has not increased. Fear is a powerful tool. When the USA, has no more constitutional rights, and the jab has had its intended effect, you will understand.",l8e8kj,2021-04-26 01:13:58

Passed out, woke up at 6am lifeless, head pounding and strong fatigue. Had to take the day off work due to to fact that I couldn‚Äôt think straight and had a fever of 102 and chill. Fever lasted about 8 hours and getting out of bed was a chore. It was a tough day, unlike anything ive ever experienced

Next day I felt 65%, enough to get out of bed and work but was still getting chills and fever. 

Day 3 85%. Mild headaches throughout the day but had enough sitting around and walked and played 9 holes of golf. Played amazing.. maybe it‚Äôs the shot. 

Day 4 - woke up with a headache still feeling a little fatigue and now have a mild dry cough. Mind is racing. Do I have Covid?

Anyone experience anything similar? Should I get tested or is this just my body fighting back?

"Tachycardia can be caused by serious heart conditions such as SVT aka sinus ventricular tachycardia. It can also be caused by an arrhythmia.  Get it checked out by a cardiologist immediately if it doesn‚Äôt go away. It may also simply be a response to stress or excitement. If it does not go away, SEE A CARDIOLOGIST immediately to rule out a potential heart attack, stroke or any of the above.",l7nc0f,2021-04-05 06:35:13

Is the vaccine totally perfect? No, but we don‚Äôt really have the time to create the perfect vaccine with zero side effects or risks. These vaccines will save more lives than it will take. So at this point it‚Äôs in our country‚Äôs best interest to get the current vaccines out.

Today is the first day I think I‚Äôm in the clear. If it is persistent, you can always ask your PCP or a cardiologist for something to temporarily slow your heart rate down to get you through those episodes. Hope you feel better!",l7nc0f,2021-02-07 15:23:19

"it's literally going to be so difficult to fall asleep when your heart is pounding. I don't know what the doctor can do to help you lower your heart rate, but anything to get your mind off of it would help.

"This is interesting ‚Äî it‚Äôs likely an inflammatory response, though I‚Äôm not sure the exact medical science behind it.

literally my heart rate was WILD all night but now about 28 hours later I am better...,l48m8w,2021-01-30 02:53:10
I felt pretty weak the first few days and now I‚Äôm just bleh and tired! I‚Äôve also had some chest pains like a weird kind of tense feeling near my heart I don‚Äôt know how to describe it! I hope you feel better soon! I‚Äôm about 2 weeks after my shot now and only feeling the tiredness. I did have a few headaches and a little nausea but it‚Äôs better now,l48m8w,2021-04-23 02:32:56
Any update? Im getting my vaccine today,l48m8w,2021-05-05 14:05:14
"Feeling way better today,hopefully you will too,soon!!",l48m8w,2021-04-24 03:23:37
I‚Äôm feeling the same thing it‚Äôs a chest pressure and tiredness in my legs,l48m8w,2021-05-06 02:49:08
Yesterday my leg joints in just the right side were really sore I did drive a little yesterday but not more than normal and I noticed it was much more sore than I expected. I‚Äôve had the chest pain on and off since my first vaccine but it doesn‚Äôt last very long. Also lots of fatigue but since my second dose I felt crappy the day after and yesterday I had the joint pain / a little bit of being out of breath but today I feel completely fine!,l48m8w,2021-05-06 15:48:22
"I received my second dose on 2/16 and 30 hours later was hit with flu like symptoms including extreme upper stomach cramps. Felt like my gallbladder needed to be removed. Also had a 101 degree fever, extreme fatigue, nausea and feel like I have a mild chest cold. It‚Äôs getting better but my stomach is still not normal and I‚Äôm very tired. My arm is really sore too like I had a tetanus shot. 

I‚Äôm 49 and have asthma but am otherwise in excellent health, work out 5 days a week, etc.",kx253z,2021-02-19 06:34:43
Did some of you guys after the second dosage experience chest pain and shortness of breath. I am asking because my girlfriend got her second dosage Wednesday and is feeling like that also she feels like having anxiety attacks. Please let me know if some of you are experiencing the same symptoms,kx253z,2021-01-30 04:21:11
"Yup felt exactly like you did on my first dose, I hope I don‚Äôt feel anything on the second one. I had my first Pfizer vaccine on April 22 and damn on the 24th it was hell. Disorientation, dizziness, nausea, fever, muscle aches, chills and right now as I type this April 29 2021 5:48 pm pct, I am melting on the toilet. I wonder how I will feel on the second dose. Wish me luck guys. Second vaccine will be on May 13, 2021. Will keep you guys posted. Also remind me. Cheers!",kx253z,2021-04-27 01:49:59
"I am glad to hear I am not alone.  After my 1st pfizer covid vaccine, first few days I only had pretty bad fatigue and brain fog. Then day 3 I woke up in the middle of the night with bad stomach cramps/pain.  I was so nauseated and had rampant diarrhea.  I have been having a lingering headache now and it's day 6.  Nervous for second dose.",kx253z,2021-01-29 09:46:06
"How are you doing now? Took my first dose on Tuesday and had chills, low grade fever and nausea Tuesday night. Been feeling nauseous from vaccine, woke up today with nausea and diarrhea. How are you doing now? Hope you feel better!",kx253z,2021-01-21 15:11:11
I had my second dose 2/4 and am feeling sore today... my biggest issue is a swollen axillary lymph node under the vaccinated arm... has anyone else experienced that? It‚Äôs really painful.,kx253z,2021-02-07 10:10:19
I‚Äôm having low back spasms.,kx253z,2021-04-25 00:35:13
"I hope you‚Äôre doing better! I get my second dose the same day you do. So far, all I have had is a sore arm, some ear congestion and a slight cold. Otherwise I‚Äôm fine!",kx253z,2021-04-27 18:26:25
"I had the worst experience with my second dose, I had all of the side effects- headache, nausea, chills, fever, fatigue, muscle aches, trouble breathing (and a bit of a sore throat and stuffy nose.) About 20 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to experience chest pains so intense I thought I was having a heart attack and went to the emergency room. This pain came and went for the next 8 hours and it was absolutely the worst pain imaginable, I was nauseous and almost passed out numerous times. It moved from a stabbing, squeezing feeling in my chest to my ribs, back, neck and jaw. At the ER they performed an EKG and everything looked normal, though my blood pressure was high due to the pain. I was sent home and told it was my immune system responding to the vaccine. The pain finally subsided and I‚Äôm feeling fine, though tired, 2 days after the dose. I‚Äôm scared to get the vaccine ever again but maybe I can do Moderna next time.",kx253z,2021-04-28 06:42:59
"YES! I FELT LIKE THIS AFTER Shot2!! I got my #2ladt Friday and still feel like crud today. Granted not as bad, but I ve been nauseated off and on since 5 pm on Friday.

"I had my 2nd üíâ on 5/1. Started having flu like symptoms that evening. Aches, chills and low grade fever until 5/4. Then felt great. 5/7 started having brain fog (Vox fog). Tonight, 9 days later I‚Äôm feeling achey and have a low grade fever again. üò¢ anyone else have symptoms more than a week later? Wondering if I should ride it out or get tested.",kx253z,2021-05-11 05:03:07
How are you doing now? Is everything back to normal? My husband has asthma and is getting his first dose today.,kx253z,2021-03-07 15:06:30
Did you die,kx253z,2021-03-12 20:51:42
Sounds just like me today. How long did it last?,kx253z,2021-04-25 00:36:05
"I had the Moderna vaccine #2 8 days ago and have been having a racing heart beat, little chest discomfort, sweaty palms/soles that continues to come in waves. Is she still experiencing it, or did it go away? Went to the ER. They couldn‚Äôt really say but feel it may be related to the vaccine. Sent me to a cardiologist. Wearing a heart monitor now. I definitely feel this is vaccine related because of the acute onset. Hoping it resolves soon.",kx253z,2021-02-06 02:37:17
"Hi, I just had my vaccine today and I am starting to feel chest pains and shortness of breath. I really think it‚Äôs another side effect, I don‚Äôt usually have chest pains.",kx253z,2021-02-24 04:50:24
"Yes! I got my first vaccine on 3/8 and it‚Äôs not what, 3/24? Tachycardia hit the last week, extreme exhaustion and brain fog. Chest pain too as well as what I guess feels like vertigo. Anxious for 2nd round .",kx253z,2021-03-24 04:45:03
I had bad fatigue and brain fog after my first dose too. Almost threw up at work and had bad diarrhea as well.,kx253z,2021-02-25 02:44:11
"I‚Äôm all good now, these side effects only lasted through the night and I was fine the next morning.",kx253z,2021-01-29 09:50:42
hey u/greenrainbows11. I had my vaccine 4 days ago and I'm starting to have stomach problems. I have been wondering if it's from the vaccine or not. I'm curious if you are still feeling sick?,kx253z,2021-01-24 21:55:35
I got that after the first dose. It went away after a couple days. That's normal,kx253z,2021-02-10 02:25:09
"Yeah, got huge and hurt for about 4 days. That‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs working. üòâ Jk but really it happened.",kx253z,2021-05-17 05:05:12
Me too.  Did yours stop?,kx253z,2021-04-29 05:19:02
For reference I am a healthy 17 year old girl.,kx253z,2021-04-28 06:43:42
How are you feeling now? Having a similar experience.  Second dose was yesterday.,kx253z,2021-04-29 05:21:45
I‚Äôm sorry I was off Reddit for awhile. I‚Äôm fine now. Hope your husband did well with it.,kx253z,2021-03-29 01:30:14
Not yet,kx253z,2021-03-29 01:25:56
Almost three days then I woke up feeling completely fine. Went from lying in bed to hiking five miles. I hope yours dissipates even quicker!,kx253z,2021-04-25 05:26:57
Hey how did everything go with your heart monitor? I experienced bad heart racing tonight about 30 mins after my shot. It‚Äôs more 2 and half hours later and it‚Äôs still slightly elevated. I‚Äôm drinking tons of water but I‚Äôm scared,kx253z,2021-03-10 01:14:49
"How are you feeling now? I got mild chest pains with my first shot, and I‚Äôm really thinking I may not get the 2nd now because of it.",kx253z,2021-04-23 00:08:37
My stomach problems began day 3/4.  I did a PCR respiratory panel at work (I am an RN) and it came back with nothing.  Aka meaning I was experiencing side effects.,kx253z,2021-01-29 09:48:15
"I haven‚Äôt had much of an appetite. I eat and keep my food down, but when I see food I feel a bit of nausea. Nausea is not as bad as a couple of days ago though. Have you contacted a Dr by any chance? I hope you feel better soon!",kx253z,2021-01-24 22:02:32
"Mine is gone now, but it got to the size of a cue ball and stuck around for a while, we named her Harriet, may she Rest In Peace.",kx253z,2021-02-12 03:14:37
Yes everything was over within24 hours ish. Hope you feel better. I took two ibuprofen twice during that day.,kx253z,2021-04-29 20:28:30

"Heart monitor showed sinus tach with occasional PACs. For most people, it seems the elevated heart rate resolves after a few days to a week. I guess I'm the unusual one where it has lasted coming up on 6 weeks.",kx253z,2021-03-11 04:17:17
"Fortunately I was fine with the second. The first was more severe for me, but I‚Äôd get it again. The person who did my shot said it was prob anxiety .",kx253z,2021-04-24 04:41:49
I had my vaccine 5 days ago and today I felt an extreem head/nexk pain and I vomited. i Am not sure if it is a side effect or not at this moment ...,kx253z,2021-05-19 04:01:29
I'm more than 24 hours past the second dose and I feel fine. Don't wanna jinx it but I feel normal,kx253z,2021-02-12 14:46:04
"Significantly better.  Still feel a little off, but probably 85-90% better than earlier in the week.  Cheers to surviving!",kx253z,2021-05-02 07:02:53

Did your HR return to normal?,kx253z,2021-04-23 04:21:26
"You may be fine... I had a rough go, but the worst of it was the first 24 hours or so. I‚Äôve also spoken with folks who felt fine and had no issues at all. I hope you remain in the second camp.",kx253z,2021-02-12 15:04:55
Likewise. I still get headaches throughout the day and my chest feels a little achey but feeling very lucky now that the worst of it is over.,kx253z,2021-05-02 18:58:21
